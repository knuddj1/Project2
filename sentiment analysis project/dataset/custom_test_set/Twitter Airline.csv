@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa,-1
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.,-1
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe,-1
@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof,-1
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.,-1
