"several important problems: Since I retired I have assumed total responsibilty for cleaning the house and as a man I am always looking for the most effective (easy) method. The Floor Keeper is a great concept but unfortunately has several important flaws. These include:1. The machine tips over too easily when the water tank is empty and the cord in wound on its holder...it is just a matter of time before something will break.2. The shut off cleaning dispenser indicater is difficult to read...the only real way you know is when water is pooling on the floor.3. The dirty water tank only holds 12 0z of solution (the amount of a large cup of coffee) before the vacuum shuts off. The time you spend emptying the tank makes mopping seem quick and simple. Back to the basics!

"Disappointing, even for the money...: I bought this one and all I can say is be very careful, the cannister containing the ice cream is made of VERY thin and flimsey metal. I made a total of two complete batches before it got banged up and dented by just spinning in the ice. A big leak developed and the unit became useless. And Rival is listing replacement metal cannisters at about the cost of three new units....Buyer beware...

With the Diaper Champ you can buy your own trash bags and its saves more money and has a lot more room for diapers.

"Why send a DVD to the UK that cannot be played in the UK?: We thought it would be fun to have a virtual 'real fire' at Christmas with friends and family. Unfortunately the company sent us a DVD which can only be played in area one, to a UK address, in the UK we require area two DVDs.This is the second DVD to arrive late and unusable. I have contacted the company and they have not even bothered to acknowledge my inquiry?

"They should burn every copy of this movie, even the digital ones.: This movie was horrible. The acting was horrible. The story was horrible. The ending was horrible. It was like they gave 30% effort into making this movie. The ""actress"" that plays Snow White has no emotions except blah. Yes I know her name, but typing it makes me angry at this movie. Charlize Theron who is a great actress must have been quite drunk/drugged when she agreed to help make this steam pile.

"A Rehash of Old Grudges: It's difficult to understand the enthusiasm other reviewers feel for this book. While I am a staunch advocate of Second Amendment rights, ""Stopping Power"" adds little to the debate. The book contains very little material written orginally for this edition; rather, it's a compilation of various unpleasant e-mail threads and letters to the editor. It seriously aggravated me to have paid for a book containing verbatim transcripts of junk I could have read for free on the Internet. Mr. Schulman is bright and makes some strong arguments, but overall the work is shoddy -- petulant, unscholarly, and devoid of editing.Pass on this one.

"Kaboom..... what a dud: I love Kaboom products, but this product doesn't work. It says fill one cap and pour in toilet. I have small toilets and it took a cap and 1/2. Then it still didn't go to the rim (whole point of the product). It was only good for 3 cleans... awfully expensive stuff to only clean the potty 3 times.I say use the good ole spray and brush it takes just as long to do that as it does to pour this nonsense into you toilet and wait for it to not work.

"There are MUCH better books out there...: I am so mad at this book. The questions were poorly worded, the strategies weren't very helpful, some of the questions has wrong answers (I mean totally wrong)..The worst thing of all was that the last test was so easy, it was obviously an attempt to make you believe that the book helped you to improve to a near-perfect score. I thought I was a moron because I was still scoring low on real LSAT's. Then I bought Cracking the LSAT and Master the LSAT and ended up scoring where I wanted to. This book is recommnended only if you are taking the LSAT in 2 days, haven't studied, and this is the only book you can find.

"Not worth it, but here's the one that so is...: Working socks on two circular needles is great for socks. But this book does nothing to help the person who wants to be able to create socks for multiple sizes and then experiment with design and needle size or yarn or just want to do more than the few patterns in the book.So I suggestSensational Knitted SocksThis book is incredible. You can use the same pattern to knit on 4 DP needles, 5 DP needles, and 2 Circular needles. All the instructions are clear and concise. Plus the book allows you to make 1000's of different types of styles of socks. Combine different patterns to get great socks and challenging projects.

"JUNK: I bought a ATP JX-160 and installed it on my return cooler line on my freshly rebuild trans in F350 Super Duty and within the first 20 miles down the road it blow apart where the top screws on. And if I didn't pull over when I did I would have blown up my new trans. I will never use one again!!! If it isn't made out of a steel housing I don't want it.

"NOT what it seems: This is very poor quality. It is cheaply constructed, and when it arrived to our home, the base was warped! The pieces have to be shoved into place. Not good for a child trying to match, believing she's done so, and finding herself discouraged that they don't fit; therefore must not actually match... I wouldn't purchase this item again.

"Horrific: No, not ""terrific,"" but horrific, as in terrifyingly bad. This book, rife with spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors, is the perfect example of an author having just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Some have praised the ""training techniques"" contained within for being ""revolutionary"" or ""contrarian"". In my opinion, as a veterinary hospital practice manager who works with doctors specializing in canine and feline behavior, the only words for the techniques provided here are ""laughably wrong."" In fact, many of the techniques are guaranteed to reinforce behavior exactly opposite of that the owner is trying to achieve.This book will certainly appeal to those who already have a deep distrust of behavioral experts and veterinarians--simply because its recommendations are the antithesis of proper training and nutrition. But common sense and a working knowledge of logic and science will steer any clear thinking individual away from this hapless piece of drivel.

"Cool to the Touch Inside and Out: I give the CPT-120 two stars for being cool to the touch and easy to clean crumb drawer. However, just above the crumb plate is the body of the toaster, which is plastic and built like a grille. This requires small crumbs and an obstacle that many crumbs have to get through to make it to the plate. This holds crumbs in the toaster body making it necessary to turn the toaster up-side-down to hopefully shake the crumbs out for cleaning.On toasting, after toasting an entire loaf of bread - sliced at different thicknesses for a test here's my findings.1/2+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Only toasts on one end; Other end is still untoasted1/4+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Still only one end; Burns the thinner slice1+1 inch sized slices-settings 4->: Still only one end toasted; Toasting quality uneven and unpredictableThis is an attractive model but not acceptable for daily use.

"Regret buying it!: Had this machine for three years. It was great while it lasted, but recently I had to get it serviced. DeLonghi does not stand behind their product. Don't mind spending $1000, but I expect it to last longer than three years. The company had no solution for me, their answer was sorry it's pass the 2 years, so you are out of luck. Will never buy anything from Delonghi again!!!!!

"Very flimsy.: I was running around outside with my brother and my dog. For a moment, my brother grasped a bit of the armpit section of the shirt, and with almost no pull at all, he managed to tear a grapefruit-sized hole in the material. I've had Smartwool shirts stand up to substantially higher levels of abuse than this minor torquing. This shirt is just too flimsy for me, and my $30 wasted will be better put towards a higher quality shirt.

"""On Christmas Day"" Image submitted by Brenda: Although it is better than nothing, and has different cover art than the CD I own, which some may prefer, the quality of this scan can be greatly improved. I would suggest that Brenda resubmit the cover art for this disc with the following tips in mind: (a) Try scanning in color if possible, (b) remove the sheet or booklet on which the cover art is printed from the jewel box before scanning the image, and (c)edit the scan by cropping the image so that the bits of the jpg file are full of the desired image rather than the background of the entire glass on the surface of the scanner to create the final image.

"don't buy: i have been trying to play this game with my four year old, and it is very frustrating. erika moves oh-so-slooooooooooow, it takes forever to get her to walk across a room. then, you must do the activities in order---if my little girl wants to ""find the kitten"", she has to start the entire game over to do it. same for ""baking a cake"", and all the other activities. you can't just click on something and do it.all in all, it's very aggravating.

"Batteries are not reliable: This was a very expensive combo kit. I bought it because I'm a do it yourselfer and I try to buy the best tools to make my life easier and so that I can enjoy doing the work with good tools. The batteries in this combo failed early - just over one year. I took them back to the Milwaukee store here in Dallas and they reluctantly replaced them for me. Now they are both dead again...Check out the price of new batteries - omg!I would not recommend buying the 28V Combo Kit unless you have lots of money for spare batteries.

"One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!: This movie is horrible. The story is predictable. The acting and dialogue are bad. The CGI and sets are laughable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This was a low budget made for TV movie that may not have ever even made it to the small screen. Lance Henrickson has made his share of bad movies, but this one is by far the worst.

"Paul Finebaum is a moron: I received this book as a gag gift and read it anyway. Paul Finebaum has had few origional ideas of his own and makes a living from bashing people and misrepresenting the truth. The jokes are recycled and stale.

"Looks nice, but didn't work.: I bought this flashlight as a replacement for my other broken one. I bought it mainly because of its small size and price. I would have loved it if it worked, but the first time I took it out of it's packaging it wouldn't even turn on. I opened it up and looked at it but everything looked fine. I twisted the cap back on and gave it a light tap and it turned on.I figured it was good to go and let it sit. A couple weeks later I came back to it and tried to turn it on again. Well needless to say it didn't, even after trying anything I could think of to turn it on. It's a nice looking product, but one that I won't be buying in the future.

"Warped Lens, Dim Lamp: True, this thing has no clip so it's not as pictured. I'd be calling Dremel to get a replacement, except for its other two fatal flaws.Fatal flaw one is that the LED lamp is so dim as to be almost useless. Even in the sample photos, the light it casts barely shows up there.Fatal flaw two, and far and away the worst, is that the lens is made from a cheap plastic that is warped and doesn't magnify clearly. The magnification varies across the field of view, inconsistently so. The cheap plastic is also prone to scratches and scrapes which, considering what it was designed for, that it would be in the line of chips coming off a rotary tool, was a stupid material choice.A non-fatal flaw is that the batteries are difficult to insert and get positioned correctly.The only good thing I can say is that the gooseneck is of a good quality that holds its position well and stays put as you move the tool around.Not a lot to recommend this.

"Felt Let Down: I was very disappointed with this movie. I guess because Larry David was in it I expected constant humor and to be laughing during the whole thing. It was just plain awful. Ironically, the previews they showed before the movie came out was the only real funny part in the movie. It was just so bland and I kept waiting for something funny to happen. Well, it didn't. Not good. Why would Larry David do this and as he was doing it, why did he think it was funny? Maybe he had no control though so I will have to blame Woody Allen then. I'm usually a Woody Allen fan, but not for this movie. Sorry. Not very good.

"A musical disaster: As this is an audio recording, I'll only judge this product through the sound that I hear from playing it. Handsome faces play no partly in the assessment whatsoever.So, what did I hear on this recording? Sad to report, I hear a hour of appalling singing and bland performances. Russell Watson, who claims to be a tenor, is evidently not one. His voice doesn't have the amplitude and range for a true tenor. Besides, his technique is so fallible that people who're familiar with the music will worry for him at every turn of the phrase. Unfortunately, such worries are often justified for the number of vocal blunders that Watson commits is legion.I won't recommend this substandard recording to anyone. After all, there're much better cross-over vocal albums in the market. It is not necessary to waste one's money on such a bad product, unless one wants to hear how badly Watson's singing can be.

"The Secret is? Positive Thinking: The Secret of this book is positive thinking, no big secret to everyone out there. I have seen where the author said she got the idea for this book while reading the book, THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH by Wallace Delois Wattles.

"Climbing Roses pattern has errors: Perhaps this has been corrected in a subsequent edition. I knitted two afghans and they were great. I got to the climbing Roses on page 82 and was told to cast on 286 stitches. It took forever and the pattern was completely off. Finally after about a foot, I started to look at other patterns and realized that probably I should have cast on 100 less. I am really disappointed that the numbers were not correct and I wonder how many other errors there are in this book! (Lilacs in Bloom on 116 is fine and Royal Luxury on 62 is fine). PS, the book binding is falling apart.

All in all a great product (plus Sanford satisfaction guarantee is a plus in case the product does not conform to expectations). However, the seller, TNT Deals INC is not so good and the reason why I gave 1 star to the item; after all the seller does influence the product experience... The item was not ready for shipping for 3 business days after all the other items were ready and my shipment ended up being delayed due to this...

"make it better---john kee: I believe that John Kee is a genius, but has let down his listeners on his past few albums. He should vere off to a bit more traditional or more to contemporary, but none the less---the music all sounds the same usually from album to album. He should allow his musicians to write or get some help in from Fred, Donald, or Kirk.

"Disturbing, Depressing and Morbid: I honestly cannot believe the four other good reviews for this movie. This is one of the most depressing films I have seen in years.

"Great Budget Camera BAD LCD: I have owned this camera for 2 months, maybe 50 shots total and the unit has never been dropped or handled roughly. Over the weekend my wife had a baby shower and when I turned the camera on I noticed in the top right corner a white square about the size of a stamp with a black line across the screen, took all of about 2 seconds to realize my display was broken!I keep this camera in a case and again not a scratch on it, have owned other digitals for YEARS never a issue or even a scratch on a single display of mine HP, Lumix, Kodak, Canon, this is my first Nikon and got it just as a quick carry and shoot, overall it was a bit noisey to use but pics came out fine no complaints for the $$ yet now with no display and not even having done anything to it (no drops no opps moments) I am stumped and find myself with a broken camera :(

"POOR design: The manufacturer ships this vacuum in a way that requires some minor assembly; the wheels and their plastic support need to be attached to the canister. Simple enough, except the wheels require that you ""push and twist"" in order for them to seat properly. I was unable to get even one wheel to attach as described in the instructions; the wheel actually broke during assembly.Why can't the manufacturer ship a product like this without any additional assembly?I read reviews indicating others had the same problem; I should have taken their advice and found something else. Good luck if you buy this one!

"Lovers and Other Strangers: The film was made in 1970 and I still want to buy it. There aren't too many 30-year-old movies I want to have on video, so there must be something to it. It has classic lines and terrific humor with good performances all around. You will enjoy it.

"I was surprised by this book: Instead of loving the Ya-Yas, I was surprised by how much I disliked this book. Wells can get specific vignettes just right: a small-town contest that falls into disarray, or girls out on the sleeping-porch on a hot summer night, are wonderfully drawn.The framework for these vignettes is a problem, though: how can a person's, Vivi's, memories be invoked in her daughter when that daughter simply holds a memento from Vivi's scrapbook? Some divine or magical agency? ESP? Who knows? A loving group of women who help their friend's daughter understand her mother better by *telling* her stories would be more mundane, but also more credible and involving.That may be a problem that only I have with the book, but why spend leisure time on a character who is as completely toxic as Vivi? I recommend it if it rains on your vacation and it's the only book you've got.

"Beware, the glass breaks easily and can cut deeply!: I have purchased two of these Bodum French presses. The first time, the glass shattered in my hand as I was washing it, and a piece of it severely cut my hand. I thought this was a fluke, and bought another one. Once again, a large piece of the glass broke off before I even washed it, and cut my finger. I will never again purchase one of these, as the glass, or whatever material it really is, is way too thin, fragile and prone to breakage to be safe. Buyer beware!

"Very Biased: The graphic design of the maps is creative, attractive and professional. The information is presented very well; however, the information is not worth presenting. I expected some level of objectivity, especially since in the book the Peace Research Institute of Oslo bills itself as ""an independent institute with an international staff.""On page 42, the book states ""Israel was founded in 1948 and extended its territory beyond the UN plan. It expanded again in 1967, and in the early 1980s took control of a 'security zone' in southern Lebanon."" This makes it seem like Israel simply wants to expand its borders. This book does not mention times when countries invaded Israel and also does not mention terrorism! (It does however, speak of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah ""activists."")In short, buy this book if you want some excellent examples of infographics. If you want to educate yourself on world crises, however, an Internet search will serve you better.

"Not Helpful: This product is good only if you already have an understanding of sign language and are looking for a way to brush up. The signs are shown entirely too fast for someone who doesn't know any signs and the mock-scenarios only succeed in aggravating would be learners. Even the sections detailing the alphabet are done too fast to be learned effectively. The only useful part of this purchase is the DVD-ROM dictionary that comes with it. This allows the would-be learner to move at their own pace and repeat words, letters and signs at will. Overall not a good buy, and no, I will not be recommending this to anyone.

"Are you suprised??: Quite simply no one from Pink Floyd has had a successful solo career. I didn't expect this latest release from David to be anything better than his previous solo albums or Rodger's, or Nick's or Richard's.The simple fact is when the four of these guys were together as Pink Floyd that is when they shined.So why keep releasing solo albums? Probably to fight of boredom. It can't be for money cause they are already setup for life.Despite which member of Pink Floyd who you believe to be the heart and soul, none of the solo albums they have released compare to what the four of them created together as Pink Floyd.

"Not bad but not really worth the price: The Networking Essentials Flashcards is a nice little resource to have, especially the poster-size crib-sheet, but it's not really worth the money.Buy a stack of white, index cards at the drugstore for $1.50, and make up your own set of flashcards. You can include more detail, and searching for the information yourself will allow you to remember it better.

"exciting adventures poorly told: A real disappointment. I admire the writer's chutzpah and ability to take what comes, and I can only imagine she has considerable personal charm to talk herself into the places and situations in which she found herself.

It is particularly aggravating that a professional writer who has evidently lived an extraordinary life can only speak about it in tired - VERY tired - cliches.

"Descent: This is a descent book, and the information on forwards and defenders is adequate, and at times good even. I thought the book was a little thin, and particularly I thought it lacked in discussing various roles and attributes and positioning for midfielders. I would also not consider this an ""intermediate book"" it is more of a basic-level of tactical understanding, good for a beginer moreso than the advanced or intermediate tactician.In my opinion the midfield is the most important aspect of the game, the link between defense and attack, and the core of possesion and it is largely ignored in this book. A massive flaw to an otherwise descent book.It's worth a read I suppose, but it is hardly earth-shattering or special.

This is the second time that this series has been purchased from here and the first time I thought it was my DVD Player; however, it is not.

"A waste of money!: I was unpleasantly surprised at the atrocious standard of poetry in this book.I would describe these poems as a series of rants rather than poetry. The author, Kim, tries to put forward the idea that Christians must stand up to supposed oppression from Jews (non existent) with violence; using the worst poetry imaginable. The material presented in these rants would be disagreeable to most readers, especially those of the Christian faith, who would be shocked to find that a so called expert in Christianity is encouraging violence on a false pretext. Most Christians will concur with me that Christianity preaches tolerance and peace e.g. love thy enemy etc.This book is certainly not a good read and a complete waste of money!

The only thing that stopped me was a mention of Jade DeVeau, the heroine from 'When Darkness Falls'.

"Maybe It's just not my type of book, but it was BORING..: While I thought the idea was fascinating, and potentially engrossing, I found myself continually flipping ahead looking for something to *happen*...

"Good Work...Could Be Better: Smith does an excellent job of providing a concise summary of the events that lead to the Binion trial, the most notorious criminal trial in Las Vegas'colorful history.However, he falls short in providing insight not already avilable in the archives of this story appearing elsewhere on the World Wide Web. In addition, character and event analysis fall woefully short of expectations, especially those of us familiar with Smith's other works.You will enjoy this book if you are vaguely familiar with the trial,and want details. If, however, you know a lot about this case already, you will be disappointed.The author does categorically and persuasively state his opinion of this case, which may take some of you by surprise.

"Daughter could pop it open with a shoe in under 10 seconds: We bought this to keep car keys and prescription drugs away from our teenager. The first one never worked so we returned it. On the second one, we couldn't change the combination so we finally learned the one that it defaulted to. The 9v batteries died in it constantly and if the lock box is shaken (as teenagers are prone to do) the battery connector comes loose and then you can't even ""jump start"" it with another battery as indicated in the directions. The final straw was when our daughter admitted that all you had to do was pop it in the corner with a shoe and the door would spring open. False security.

"Not a good example of the Rev: This album misses it totally for me.I love the first three albums, great melodys, great guitar playing. This is more like some kind of bar chord punk. I don't mind a band changing up but this is a step down. The Rev. is known for great guitar playing, this album doesn't feature that at all.

"Don't get it.: Like many people have said, it is very loud. Think about it, it makes a little noise every minute, then a bigger noise every 5 minutes, then a even bigger noise every hour, then a huge noise every 12 hours. Very very noisy. In addition, it is not accurate. It will keep good time for 30 minutes or so, but for whatever reason (maybe it's slow, maybe the balls don't work properly, I don't really know because I never sat there and watched it to find out what's wrong), it will be off. I made sure to set it to the correct time before I slept, and when I woke up, it was more than an hour slow. I'm not even thinking of returning it. It's just so loud I don't want it anymore.

"Disappointing: One of the rear satellite speakers did not work for me. I connected the speakers to two different computer systems to rule out problems other than the speakers themselves, and the same problem with both, the right rear satellite speaker would not work. I did check out the sound for a two speaker configuration, and was less than thrilled with the sound quality even at that. The sound was not very strong, almost ""tinny"" compared to my Altec Lansing cheapies that I was looking to replace. I returned these speakers for a refund.About the best thing I can say for this VS3251 system is it made me appreciate my old set of speakers a whole lot more after I reconnected them.

"Boring, Plodding, and Tiresome: I usually can read a 500 page novel in about 4 days. Jerlayne took me over 2 weeks - and I really pushed myself to finish!This book had very little explaination about how/why certain things were happening. I felt like I was reading the second book in a series the entire time. The characters were totally uninteresting - even the title character Jerlayne was a bore. I had no sympathy to anyone in this book because they were 2-dimentional sadsacks. I would have liked to read more about the relationships between the characters instead of being told ""they loved each other."" I wish we would have been shown more than told.If you like books that are about having children and housework, by all means, read Jerlayne.If you like books that have a smooth plot, interesting/believable relationships, and intelligence please, read something else.

"John Mayer - the Cure for Insomnia, AND LIFE: John mayer is best known for his work in the famous ""Famous Ray's All American Rock and/or Roll.""However, his solo career isn't nearly as good. Just listen to one of his songs. He plays so slow and low that any rightthinking music fan must hate it. Hes like Dave Matthew's and Hootie and the Blowfish's evil love child. He must be stopped. If you like this though, i highly recommend the Cash Money Millionaire's ""Thug Money Gs"" and PPP Death Squad's ""Death's Head.""

"terrible movie - no action, no acting - just boredom: I am glad I did not pay $10 to watch this in the theater. I am glad I did not pay $5 to rent from Blockbuster. I caught it for free on HBO and was very, very disappointed. I fell asleep half way during the movie. There are no exciting (or even non-exciting) action sequences. The acting is terrible and the story is way overdrawn.In conclusion, if you want to see Michael Mann at his best, watch Heat. If you want to see him at his worst (or are having difficulty falling asleep and need some help), watch this snooze-fest.

"DVD Player is seriously suspect: I purchased one and the DVD player did not work after two weeks. It looked like a digital signal getting scrambled and delayed. Then it would just outright freeze and not respond at all. Cleaning the disc helped...a little bit, but different DVDs,including new ones, would have the same problem. Knowing Sony as a reputable brand, I returned it for a replacement. Encountered the same problem about a month in. I have a Sony cd player that's been fantastic, but this combo must cut corners somewhere, as it's a serious, and seriously frustrating problem.

"There Are No Words to Express...: How bad this movie is.It's not just cheesy, it's also dumb. Just plain dumb. What happens when you get an intriguing plot, good actors, and cool sets? Oddly enough, you get a poorly acted, scripted, ridiculous film.The plot is pretty good, although not in the least bit scary, as was advertised in the trailers. During the dramatic parts, I couldn't keep from laughing. It was hard to believe some people actually wanted us to be quiet - were they actually enjoying the film? The acting done by the man who plays Terry Glass is comical, not a reflection on him though - just the silly character. They try to keep you guessing, but I knew what was going on the moment I sat down (and I arrived late!)Bottom line: Don't waste your money, like I did. At least see something midly enteraining, like 'The Musketeer', if you insist on seeing a bad movie this fall.

"poop mess: I purchase this for my dwarf rabbit. It is well made and looks fun for the rabbit, but because of the plastic, the poop does not fall to the bottom of the cage.

"Very uneven: Once you get past the 20s the book dries up, until you get to the 80s and a section that must have been written by Guliani's p.r. firm. The writing is not good (how many times can the author say someone died of ""lead poisoning?"") and the editing matches the writing. If you are not from New York, and want to know anything about the Mafia from 1930-1985, than this book is not for you.

"WWFailure: Alright, now I'm a HUGE WWF fan. I really am. After Volumes 3 & 4 I thought we were gonna see a blockbuster here from the WWF Music Team. Ohhh man was I wrong. Like the last album, Triple H's theme is above and beyond the other themes on the CD. SOO many important themes were left off of this CD! Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Dudley Boyz, Undertaker, hell they didn't even add on the Hardy Boyz' theme, which I feel is honestly the best theme music in the WWF today (Well, ok, next to Triple H's). Being a WWF fan, of course I was suckered into buying this, but from now on the WWF logo isn't going to be as persuasive in my eyes as it has been in the past.

"Where do I start...: House of Wax is such a horrible remake of a classic film that it makes the also abysmal remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror look like Oscar nominees. The original film from way back in the 1950s was a classic but WHY THE FU** DOES THIS HAVE PARIS HILTON?!?! She's a dumbass and a complete idiot as it is but the fact that she's in horror movies makes me want to vomit! At least her character dies in the movie...MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO HER IN REAL LIFE!!! Chad Michael Murray is also a bad actor and an idiot. He sucked in that stupid show One Tree Hill and he's even worse in this pile! If you see this movie, it's a sin to quality. Watch the original instead even if it's in black and white.

"what?!?: Ok...this book is definetely NOT for those who adore Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice...for starters, although the author DID research P&P, she obviously did NOT pay attention to details such as the first name of Col.

"A Dumb Movie About A Young Genius: Jodie Foster directed this movie - a child prodigy's search for social acceptance. Fred Tate is a precocious fourth grader who has no problem with the most complex mathematical problems or in banging out a Rachmaninoff concerto on the piano, but is totally inept at playing baseball or dealing with children his own age. His mother Dede is a cocktail waitress who cares passionately about her son. Fred comes to the attention of child psychologist Jane Grierson who runs a summer camp for child prodigies called Odyssey of the Mind. She invites Fred to attend the summer session, creating a rift between Fred and Dede. Fred decides he's not interested in genius things like attending a university class, and would rather play pool and have friends. The movie is a poor waste of nearly two hours.

"Boringly ever after: I usually wait two days after watching a DVD before writing its review. Unfortunately for this movie, I saw Shrek 3 at the theater the day after watching this on DVD. The storylines are eerily similar, however the execution of this movie was much worse. The plot of this movie is simple; Cinderalla's evil stepmother leads an uprising of villians and villianesses to take over Fairy Tale Land. Prince Charming's manservant and Cinderalla lead the good guys and win the day for all.The animation of this movie was ok; not smoothflowing like traditional cartoons, and not pure CGI realism like Pixar movies. The music was plain and forgettable. The comedy was downright sloppy and unfunny. And the dialogue ranged from simple to stupid. I would recommend against spending the time or money for this DVD.

"Terrible: Bought this a year ago today actually.First of all...the band broke after one month...then...the casing started to wear showing that the casing is actually painted on...that is not the true color of the casing...and then...this weekend while on a hunting trip I noticed that no matter what direction I was headed...it always said NE. Luckily a friend brought a compass and we were able to find our way back to the truck...and ultimately me back to my PC to write a review for this terrible product.So...consider this you warning...and BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!

"Good Sound - BADDDD Durability/1 Year Warranty?: I used these a couple of days a week. However, I would always ensure they were properly wrapped up. Either way, the black casing on the ends started to retreat, exposing the wires. Now, they will not work at all. And what is worst, I have only had these a little more than a year, so the warranty is not good any more.

"Heartbreaking is right: The book should have been titled A Heartbreaking Work of a Staggering Narcissist. It starts out great...a modern day Confederacy of Dunces but becomes a mudslide after the first 20 pages. The book is very simply a memoir of a self-absorbed 21 year old on a Ginsberg/Kerouac rant. By the time the reader reaches ""page 109"" it is time to take the book back to the library (because he/she has been savvy enough to borrow it and not buy it).The Table of Contents and Acknowledgements sections are entertaining...don't bother with the rest.
",-1
"A huge disappointment: This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else.

"TOTAL RIP OFF: The outside is very misleading. This is actually two older cds that were obviously laying around some warehouse that MCA repackaged. No remastering no nothing, just old cds. There are similar ""Love collections"" out recently with other country artists so buyers beware!!!
",-1
"The worst book I've ever read!: I'm astounded that a book this poorly written could get published let alone be a New York Times best seller. Character development was non-existent and the plot was incredibly stupid. It was as if she just added to the storyline as she went along without giving any thought as to how it would fit with what was already written (I know, let's have her inherit $8 million even though there was no hint of her family's wealth in the first part of the book!). What a waste of time!

"Not the Greatest: If you have a small room and don't mind a decent amount of noise this could be your choice. It has a large capacity but that didn't help because it's not dispersing moisture. The sponge type material inside, which quickly fills with brown gucky mold, dries out rock hard at the top while wet only at the bottom. It does keep an even moisture in a small room or a medium room with no heat blowing. The Crane Ultrasonic kills this thing in my opinion. I have many vintage guitars and like the humidity to be just right, this did not keep up, and noisy. The only drawback with an ultrasonic is you must get it up off the ground or it will get wet, three feet up and your fine.

"Big Disappointment: This book is suprisingly bad, considering that it's put out by Avid. I agree completely with the other reviewer who compared this book unfavorably with the Final Cut Pro books put out by Apple's Training Series. Those books have clear exercises and go through the processes you're learning in a thorough step-by-step way. This book doesn't even explain the interface clearly. Then, suddenly you are instructed to hit keys that have never been mentioned before. The writer doesn't even tell you what footage he's working with most of the time. A real disaster.

"Wonderful book but...: The Bhagavad Gita by Winthrop Sargeant is probably one of the best translations and it fits into your pocket! That's the good part.

"Lady Knight's Fall (plot spoilters): Don't think I'm giving this one star because I hate fantasy or Tamora Pierce. (i love fantasy, which is why I spent around 20 dollars buying it) I loved Squire, and read it many times, and was eager to read this book just like a amazon shopper, but after the first few chapters and the story stops moving I began to have my doubts. First of all I thought Tamora pierce thought towards the end oh no this isn't going any where I need kel to do something the readers will love: I'll have her try to save all the ""small/poor"" people in a dangerous land, but I'll just have them all hanged, and when kel fights the bad guy, who I forgot to develop, her friends will be there for her. O i guess i forgot to have Kel get together with someone and that was what I was best at, oh well I'll let the readers know she might get together with Dom.

"Wierd chemicals in this one!: These have a gel filling that is a plastic solvent.

"Implausible and uninteresting: An old man thinks his life sucks (he's poor because he's only going to make 150,000/year now that he's retired, his daughter is marrying someone who is great, but just not perfect, and he doesn't have anyone to have sex with), and then it stops sucking (he figures out how to live on his money, he comes a little bit closer to accepting his daughter and son-in-law, and he finds a 20-year-old waitress to have sex with). It's fairly hard to sympothize.

"This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.

"Not a true King's Quest: I agree with oldbushie and mangomercury in their reviews. This was definately not a King's Quest game, at least not the one I remember. I love the puzzles and fairy tale creatures in King's Quest 1-7. And they are SO bright and colorful. Mask of Eternity has none of this. It is extremely dark, not just in plot but in color. When playing the game, I would have to struggle and strain my eyes to see where I was headed next. I have never been good at action games either...never have done well in trying to kill everyone around. I have no strategic ability, so I had an extremely difficult time with this game.If you are looking for a game like the previous King's Quests, do not buy this one, you will be disappointed. If you love action games, buy it, you will be satisfied.I must say that Sierra made a huge mistake in changing the King's Quest line with this last game, which is not worthy to be called King's Quest...it is simply, Mask of Eternity.

"I won't buy it!!: Based on James Ashby's (Chino Hills, CA) caustic question,""Where is the music?"", I won't waste my time buying it.

True, the film was laced with really great jazz, and I immediately wanted to buy the CD, but I won't look for it anymore. Thanks James.

"Good Book - Bad Kindle Edition: I do like these stories, but every Miss Read book seems filled with a terrible number of errors. Sentences like ""Wed, wed, you must ted me ad about it"", irritate me no end.

"Very short life: I bought this for my Epson WorkForce 40 Wireless Color Printer (C11CA27201) as a replacement when the printer reported having low ink. It lasted for maybe two uses. We had made sure to that the printer was clean and that it was properly installed, but we soon got a message that the ink was out. We're now purchasing a different brand because either this cartridge was defective or Epson is simply gouging customers. On another note, our printer itself is frustrating and doesn't work. It seems that Epson isn't high-quality, like we had thought. If this next ink cartridge doesn't work, we'll be purchasing a new printer.Edit: We've since bought a different set of cartridges and have had no problems. It's been used many times in the past weeks and is still churning out pages.

"Action, please: I once loved Gunn's novels so much I would read them like a prayer book. They were borrowed from a Scottish friend. So I ordered them all. Alas, I no longer want to read 20 pages of a salmon's progress and a boy watching it. The folk are now folkloric to me, not noble beings. The prose is more like poetry. This is not a bad thing. Maybe it is the mark of the times - I only know that I do not want to read a book with virtually no action, no dialogue, and a valorization of the lower class gathered at river's shores. So sad.

"Keynes is re- born as Krugman: Prof. Krugman at least is no apologist when it comes to supporting Keynes and his brand of economics. Not being an apologist , however , doesn't mean he is right. In fact mathematical expression of economics is totally devoid of reality. Economics cannot be simplied into equations, which is what Mr. Krugamn wants us to believe. Mant people in high places have come out strongly disagreeing with the medicine Mr. Krugman proposed and continues to propose for Japan's problems. I would suggest that most people should not pay much attention to the prescriptions in this book as we had similar Keynesian type policies discredited.

"NOT A REAL FEMALE RAPPER: TRINA IS A UNTALENTED FEMALE RAPPER. ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS MONEY, CLOTHES, CARS, SEX, AND JEWELRY. HER MUSIC IS NOT INDEPTH WITH HER LIFE. FEMALE ARTISTS THAT I CONSIDER TO BE VERY TALENTED LYRICALLY ARE EVE, FOXY BROWN, AND LIL KIM. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER, THEY ARE STILL GREAT FEMALE RAPPERS. SHE NEEDS TO STEP BACK AND WATCH HOW THEY DO THINGS. THIS ALBUM IS TERRIBLE. THE FIRST ALBUM WAS MORE TERRIBLE THAN THIS ONE. ON HER FIRST ALBUM ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS SEX AND BLOWING SOMEBODY OFF. SHE IS SO NASTY. I KNOW LIL KIM AND FOXY BROWN ARE NASTY, BUT ATLEAST THEY HAVE SONGS THAT HAVE STRONG LYRICS ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE.

Esta niñita no tiene la menor idea lo que es ser LATINA -- de latina no tiene na'...! Le di la estrella porque Amazon no me dejó darle 0. Ha sido comprobado que las personas que le dieron más de una estrella a este CD no tienen oído musical. Los que le dieron 5 estrellas TRABAJAN CON ELLA! Money talks!

"Has Potential: The problem with this show is that it is more of a character drama than a science fiction show which is one reason why the old stargate fan base is leaving. The primary focus of the show should be exploring the Universe and not character development. I mean the show is called, Stargate Universe. Lets please explore the Universe. I'm not saying there shouldn't be any character development I just think chraracter developement should be made secondary. Also it dosen't help that many of the characters are very unlikable almost to the point of being irredeemable but I still think many of the characters can reform themselves like this show still can. I hope the second half of this season and season 2 will be better.

"Very slow... boring... scattered thoughts...: Chapter 1 was BORING but had a few nice questions (but no answers, but enough to make you read on)...Chapter 2 was terrible and I put the book downPROS:- You might get a few ideas about what SOME PEOPLE think heaven MIGHT be like (if you can get through the entire book, because the goodies are scattered far and few between)CONS:- All those questions you want to know about heaven? Good luck finding them. He asks questions without answers scattered throughout the whole book.- Very scattered writings. Nothing seems to be in one place. Hard to follow any logical order to the book. It just rambles.- Difficult reading, easy to lose track of a thought (and some people think the King James was hard? ha!) Good luck for the average reader.

"I Wouldn't say NOT to buy ths DVD...: ..However, I was not happy about the fact that it is such a lame release. I LOVE Ghost In Th Shell, the Original, and I could not wait for this film. The artwork IS breathtaking, and it really is an amazing piece of filmwork... but all of the DVD features that it actually does have... suck. There is no English dubbing, which is nice to have when you want to follow the animation, and really enjoy the beauty of some of the screenshots.As with many of the other reviewers, I am not going to recommend you buy this.. but you may like to own this, so that if and when 'they' re-release it.. you can have it as a collectors item. We ARE Americans, and we do collect things, so that may be the only appeal of getting this DREAMWORKS release. Otherwise, save your cash, borrow it from a friend, and wait for the re-release.

"Faint Print Paperback: This review isn't about James Schefter's story or writing. It's about the physical Pocket Books paperback version of the book itself. The print is so faint that it makes the book hard to read. The quality of the B&W photographs is worse than what you get if you try to copy a glossy photo print directly on an old copy (not scanner) machine.

"don't buy as you can't repair it: Nice short toilet, but one problem. It is impossible to change the toilet seat. They use a non-standard connection that requires a $50 kit just to get the screws out. Think about having to replace the whole toilet in 5 years just because of the seat.

"Not In Concert: This is a cheap compilation of excerpts from Rosie's TV show and not a concert performance as the title suggests. The video and sound quality is average and the selection of songs is uneven. She lip-syncs to Nelson Riddle's fine arrangements while fiddling with props on a sterile, cartoonish set that looks like a children's show. In many sequences, she is pregnant and hiding behind windows and giant bows. Also released as ""Rosemary Clooney Singing at Her Best."" For hardcore fans only who may enjoy the extra interview with Edward R. Murrow.

"More fiction then informative: Having read the reviews I expected the book to be more instructional. Frankly, having read the reviews I was hoping the book would delve into the psychological aspects of female domination in the marriage. I was disappointed to find that it was little more than a story of a couple who invited their neighbor to share a spanking/paddling/caning session with them. If you are looking for erotic literature of this type, this is for you. If you are looking for studies, information and instruction on this type of lifestyle, keep looking.

"shoddy product from Disney: I agree with everything the previous reviewer said. The Snow White cartoon is nothing more than a few still frames thrown together to form a semi-interactive story about making pies. The other two cartoons are full motion, but they feel even flatter than the Snow White slide show. These look like the typical dribble of afternoon cartoons being cranked out by writers who lack the time, talent, or inspiration to put a decent story together. There's so little in common with the original productions, that its hard to believe you're watching Disney.From now on, I'll stick to their movies.

"Not the best: Well J.M. Coetzee attempts to make a statement on the human experience, he did so not through his character but by his simple writing and the lack of plot in the book,and how resilient one must be to read the whole book where NOTHING HAPPENS. The whole book seems to have been written in simple sentences starting with ""K"" and then some meaningless action verb. This book is really hard to read because often times one gets lost in the hard to follow sequences in the story, or one gets lost in the mundane activities that the protagonist partakes in. The book successfully avoided any of the problems in apartheid South Africa and focussed only on a simple man who wanted to grow some pumpkins. The book drags on forever. Only read if you enjoy the three D's; DULL, DUMB, and DRAB. My favorite thing about the book is that you can tell where I fell asleep while reading it because all the pages before I fell asleep are crisp and all the pages after it are wrinkled, I fell asleep on page 59.

"Almost useful...: Maybe if this sprinkler had a spike so you could keep it in the same place it would be useful.It took forever to get it set close to what I wanted (I have a huge and strangely-shaped oak in the middle of my yard, so I can't place the sprinkler there)and the second you move it, you really have to reset it all over again. The adjustments weren't fine enough for me either.And it's not obvious how to adjust it. You raise and lower the red track, and the track *behind* the nozzle determines how far the water shoots in the opposite direction. The higher the track - the shorter the stream. Really *not* intuitive.

"Single-dimensional characters + lousy dialogue= 1 star: I'm surprised that so many people love this book. Had the characters been multi-dimensional, I might have enjoyed it more. I quickly grew tired of reading about how completely evil Mr and Mrs X were and how perfect Nanny was. Every move the mother made was harsh and cruel, whereas Nanny's every touch was ""gentle."" Puh-leeze.

"Just Dreadful!: A simple review for simple people. The X-Files is a dreadful, unimaginitive show with a bad cast. Carter is talentless. He is the TV equivalent of M. Night, though even Night made one good film (Unbreakable). If you are going to spend money and time, buy the best TV series in history (aside from Patrick McGoohan's ""The Prisoner""), The Twilight Zone. You will never find better acting, bigger stars, better writing (can you say PULITZER PRIZE WINNER?!!) or better visuals. Rod Serling created the genre.The X-Files is a well made box set filled with a bad TV series. Even ""Millenium is a better way to go!

"Avoid this tool: I got this saw for Christmas 12/00. It was a beast to assemble. The directions do not include a close up, detailed image or even an accurate description of how to install the blade and you'll need that as breaking blades will become habitual and if your new to scrolling forget about those skinny fine cutting blades this saw spits them out in seconds. I've had this tool for 4-mos. and still can't do anything with it that my jigsaw can't do better & quicker. Quick change blade, not! Cheezy platic parts, yes!

"Highly overrated: Although I admit that the book finally 'picks up' some momentum after the initial 200 page slog, it never really becomes a compelling read. I did, in fact, finish this book, but only because it's difficult for me to abandon any book I've started. There is absolutely no basis for comparison between ""The Rule of Four"" and any Dan Brown work beyond the tenuous thread that some historical puzzles are being solved within the pages. The fact that the plot line of ""The Rule of Four"" is anchored in an actual historical text does nothing to lift it from its plodding pace. My copy will be donated.

"alright gun: this gun is nice if your just shooting at targets ten feet away from you, but if you want to actually play against people you will get owned, forshure. this gun is also very fragile and it already broke in half, so i would suggest spending a little more money and getting a better gun, it is well worth it if you want to play competitavly and dont want to get dominated.

"Poor work on this book: One star for some of the photos, nice to see some new ones from that time period, even if they're only in dull black and white. BUT, what a let-down this book otherwise is! He has one of the most fascinating topics to write about but he manages, chapter after tedious chapter, to dull the information with his writing style, trying to cover way too much territory, and I'm just glad that I found this at the local library and didn't waste any money on it.I feel that he went out of his way to take a whack at the entire 1970's southern Cali music scene, the likes of which we'll never know of again. Such a waste of energy this book is because of that.

As a local indie filmmaker and supporter, I don't understand how a film can be ""shot"" so badly, and with $2,ooo, that's a lot of money to work with (try it w/$1oo). A friend of mine bought it for $2o. She later would weep and say, ""I've been screwed. And my thighs are weeping."" But she kept it, seeing how she's a movie hound.

Cracks started forming on their 100 dolloar toothbrushes also! At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy.

"Would not install, no customer support: Would not install on brand new laptop and could not back out incomplete installation. Called customer support. Available weekdays only and only 9:00-5:00 I think. I work these hours so this was no good.

"Uh, I don't think so...: This is a high 1 or a low 2 as I feel it may appeal to SOMEONE else moreso than it did to me. I'm sorry to say but despite a fair number of *names* included on this disc, and some minorly interesting artwork obviously mixing the Goth world with that of the Ewan McGreggor movie, I only found a track or two (Chandeen...maybe! and Rosetta Stone) that bore repeated listening. As it sits in the back of my collection, this CD is quite skippable in favor of the more popular (perhaps justifiably so) yet slightly more expensive ""Goth Box"" or ""Black Bible"".

"This product needs some work...: I think that the idea of this product is great, but we have had more trouble with it than any other toy, ever. My three year old is a whiz at the computer and at playing nintendo games, but this game is just so slow, it stops often and it has to be re-programmed so often that it just frustrates her and me both. She is a pacient little girl, but has completely lost interest in this game and prefers to play on the computer and other toys that do not cause so much frusteration and consume so much time programming and re-programming. The ONLY game that worked out of four that I bought was the Spongebob one, and it really rarely works correctly anyway. Maybe this toy can be modified and will be a better product next Christmas.

"Could not relate at all!: Wow! I thought I was the only person who thought this book was disgusting and depressing until I read some of the 735 reviews! I guess the only redeeming quality about this book is it really got people talking about it! I read it in a weekend - continually hoping that things were going to get better for this wretched woman (no way will I call her a heroine) and it only got worse. I was reluctant to even read it when I saw it was an ""Oprah"" pick and afterwards I kicked myself for going on with it. I'm a 32 year old young woman who lives an average, middle-class life and I have no empathy for this idiot woman who could never be optimistic or look at the bright side of life. The book is only fiction, yet what really bothers me are the real women who think this is a good book because they ""feel the pain"" of what boils down to massive SELF PITY!! It's so '90s! Wally, you have no clue - this is an insult to all young women.

"A Real Disappointment: Verbose. Few, if any, good ideas. Covers broad range of topics with minimal information of value under each heading. Writing style is painful to read.

"Don't do it.: When I built my computer, I was stupid and wanted it to be obnoxiously illuminated and filled with cathode lights and LED's and EL wire.

"Life's too short for this book.: Ian Frazier is a good writer--let's get that straight. The downfall of this book is not how he writes but what he writes about. I wasn't bored out of my mind reading this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. I like to read books that move me and this book had a cruising speed of 0-1 mph. This book is a generational playback/story about his family. I often thought how amazing it was that the author could write in a way to sound like he was speaking to the reader and to keep me (just barely) reading on to the next page. This was sllooowwww reading and I thought, ""with all the books out there, I am just wasting my time reading about something I really couldn't care less about. There was nothing too fascinating about his family story. (At least to the point where I finally quit---about 1/2 way) I would never ever recommend this book. I would recommend sitting comatose in front of the tv watching really bad sitcoms over reading this book.

"done with these: Although this filter seems to do the filtering job well, I am through with this filter. I have been using them for about 4 years now and am tired of replacing the entire unit every year to year and a half or so as they begin leaking and no amount of redo-ing or teflon taping or voodoo fixes it. I feel I am throwing away far too much stuff with the continuous chucking of spent filters and the main units. Not very ecologically friendly. I am done with products that don't last.

"Ultra slow ripping speed by design: This cdrom's driver intentionally slows down ripping speeds. If you are wishing to put your legally owned music on to an mp3 player you should avoid this product. The driver description on the asus website will tell you that the speed of the cdrom is LIMITED. My first 8-10 tracks will rip at around 32x and then the cdrom will go to 1-3x for the rest of the tracks. Even with updating the firmware, this 'govenor' is in place. Why asus doesn't want you to rip mp3s could be because they want you to buy their duplicators that are hundreds of dollars in price. I'm scrapping this drive for one that will let me make mp3s at a modern speed (1-3x is ancient).

"Nothing New: I read the Garcia-Prats' first book, which was okay, but this one is simply a lot of recycled information. Some of the advice is amazingly impractical, i.e. when they talk about forgiveness. Mrs. Garcia-Prats cites a saint who forgave her daughter's rapist. In the framework of a marriage, this seems like a reach. Much of the rest of the book appears to consist of quotes and ideas taken from other ""experts."" This isn't the place to look for fresh, practical ideas. That said, they look like a nice family with cute kids.

"Not very good movie: From the Previews I had seen I thought that this movie was going to be a good one.What I saw made me what to ask for my monie back. I thought that the movie was horrible.The plot is that a woman sees her husband killed in a way that is very bad and she thinks that she is a character on a soap opera that she watches. The plot might have been bariable with better acting, but even Renee Zellweger and Greg Kinnear who are good actors did not do a very good job in this movie.

"Is this considered music?: This is by far one of the many horrible attepmts at creating good heavy music from the States. This album, along with every Corn, Limp Biscuit, etc, is some of the worst music possible. I'd rather listen to the Backstreet Boys: at least they make horrible music for an already horrible style, but with these ""heavy"" bands, they put a bad name to great metal! It's too bad Americans support such nonsense.......real music you ask? OPETH, KATATONIA, IN FLAMES, OCTOBER TIDE, CHILDREN OF BODOM, EDGE OF SANITY, DARK TRANQUILLITY, TRISTANIA, THEATRE OF TRAGEDY, ACTURUS, DIMMU BORGIR, EMPEROR, BEETHOVEN, CHOPIN, STRAVINSKY, DEBUSSY, etc. ...... real music!

"I have the steel band model of the Tissot 3000: I have this watch for almost 5 years I love the look and its features as i am almost every week in a different time zone. the down side is that the watch is not reliable at all - i have had to take it in several times for repair as several features stopped working. recently it stopped functioning again and i was told the entire mechanisim has to be changed (something I would not expect from a watch that is marketed as a high end quality)- and they asked for 350 USD to repair the watch. My sons Casio that went through tough training is already 6 years old with zero problems. I wrote to Tissot in Swiss and am waiting for there answer. In any case I would not purchase another Tissot - the reliability of the products is very poor. My friend has a T Touch and had to replace it after 3 months - and now after 4 years it has a problem again.

Lucas, yet again, destroys another potentially great movie (see the latest Star Wars movies if you don't know what I'm referring to) with his corny writing. Additionally, the prairie dogs and monkeys also were completely unnecessary. I love the first three, but this will not be a dvd I purchase.

"Image preview is misleading: I bought this harp more for its unusual shape. Upon arrival I was very dissappointed to find that it has no unusual shape, and looks much like any other harp sold on amazon for a lower price.

I will be making a phone call to the company as soon as the morning comes.

"Doomsday scenarios don't help you recover: I read this book because I had severe RSI and wanted to recover. The first thing I read in it was that I had a chronic case and would never recover. This was followed by an avalanche of anecdotes about people who are radically crippled for life. These were intermingled with depressing advice about how to ""handle"" your newfound, chronic handicap. For example, Quilter says that people with RSI can still work any job, as long as they work at their own pace. So far, so good. Then she says most employers won't let you work at your own pace and goes on to suggest that you must change careers unless you want to do even more permanent damage to yourself. Great, just the kind of upbeat advice I needed to hear.I suggest that unless you want to scare the pants off of someone who does not take their RSI seriously, you should get the original Pascarelli and Quilter book for overall information and the Damany and Bellis book for a concrete and helpful recovery plan.

"Ho Ho Hum: If you're looking for a collection of funny Christmas stories to lift your spirits, I wouldn't suggest this book. The first story has quite a few funny moments, is believable and written well, but I found the rest of the collection to be a little too bitter, minus the foreign Christmas story. That had a funny ending but then the last line put a damper on even that one. Also, who uses the word ""retarded"" anymore..? It's so NOT funny to call anyone that.

"Atrocious: A die hard dedicated Genesis fan, including the members solo works, I find the album a total disappointment and virtually unplayable.With thousands or more highly talented singers to choose from they selected probably the worst possible new lead singer. I'm not stuck on Phil or Peter, something new can be good, but this was awful. His limited, monotonous range is annoying at the least.How about the lead singer for Mike and the Mechanics for example ? Anyone but Ray Wilson !What were they thinking ?

"Sorry I bought it.: I have to echo a previous review. I don't like to use the self-propelled feature, because it just doesn't feel like it's doing the job. Yet, the switch is on the handle, and I have to hold my thumb on the switch to keep it from engaging, which it always does--annoying.Also, the vacuum does not stay upright. Usually you need to push a pedal to lower from storage to vacuum position. Well, it always falls out of storage position.The suction is okay, but not nearly as good as the Hoover I had previously.Better to spend a little more money on a better vacuum.

"Great features but kept locking up!: When I did my anaylsis for features vs. cost the audiovox came out very high on my list. It was very simple to use, it came with the maps preloaded on an SD card, it had an excellent mounting bracket, multiple views and many POI. I knew I was in trouble when I first went to use it I had it hit the reset button. Once I did that it worked great for the day, but the next morning it was locked up again and I had to reset it. With each reset I lost my waypoints. It did everything it advertised, but it just kept locking up (it is a windows based product so I should of expected it). After about 4 or 5 more attempts I boxed it up and shipped it back. Very disappointing.

"A Very Poor Effort: I have read many of the 40K novels. I have enjoyed many of them. This was not one of them. Some authors can write books that transcend the fact that they are the intellectual properties of someone else. They can make them their own and transcend the genre. This author is not one of them. Much of the dialouge and details seems very forced and inconsistent. If you play the game that this novel is based on, you get the feeling you are reading bad fluff. Everything reads as if the author is reading directly out of a codex and forces it. A bad book, badly written.

"Long and tedious, although realistic: The movie tracks Mr. Lazarescu on his last night as he travels in and out of emergency rooms in search of assistance. The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long. Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life. The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about. The editorial comment that one can visualize how ""suffocatingly slow time must seem"" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that ""suffocatingly slow"" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out.

"Not for Mac: Does not work with Mac OS X 10.6. Printing works, but you can not scan nor fax, so for an All-in-One this is like totally not working. Personally will avoid HP printers from now on, because a company that does not support it's hardware, is like making my All-in-One budget too expensive. You have to purchase a new All-in-One each time Apple brings out a new version of it's OS.

"It had typos and problems were incorrect: It has some typos and incorrect answers on some chapters. I asked my chem teacher and he agreed. What is funny is that this book was like the 2011 edition and my prof gave us the 2007 exam edition for the final exam, lol. It did not helped at all to spend 2 months reading the 2011 edition!You need several of these books and plenty of time to prepare for the acs final, if you are buying this two weeks before your final exam, good luck getting through all the questions. This is a really hard exam that requires months of preparation in advance, dont listen to other students that say "" Oh, it was really easy man! "" they probably flunked it.

"Do your research: I want to start by saying the phone works fine. It came in new condition. There was one problem. The day the phone arrived i set it up and it did not work. The phone was not the problem. The problem was with Microsoft dropping Verizon as their provider for web calling without securing a new provider. Microsoft says this lack of service is temporary and i gues we will have to wait and see.

"Be careful with this one: I fell on the floor because one of the legs slipped all the way down when I sat on it.Had double checked it to be sure it was stable, and this happened. Now, when I useit I am very tentative about it because I don't want to hurt myself. It is not a hardy piecewhere one can just open it and sit on it. Maybe I just received a lemon and the others are ok. Don't know. There are other brands out there that cost a lot more but the thing is they are stable. The price is right, but there is risk to it. Don't really recommend it, unless having a leg go down when you sit on it doesn't bother you.

"Sitting in my chair: Sitting in my chair, I saw a sunny spot on the carpet. I resisted moving for several minutes, and the spot shifted its position slightly.That's when the slender woman entered my line of vision. She was wearing a yellow plastic raincoat and pink Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers that sounded like Philly Joe Jones doing some inspired brushwork during ""Night in Tunisia"" (the Verve version, not the Bluenote).She asked me if I liked her with our without breasts, and I said simply ""Yes"", remembering that I needed to sautee the chicken breasts for dinner, add a little soy sauce, and vaccuum the carpet.When I looked up again the woman was gone. I looked back at the sunny spot, but it had started raining outside, and sounded like the rain drumming on the pith helmets of the Manchurian expedition stranded in Hangchow in the bleak autumn of 1939, when many of the soldiers were forced to unwrap their leggings and wring them out for drinking water and nourishment.(Continue for 600 pages.)

"Jesus Calling CD: I purchased this item for my 97 yr. old care receiver, but it keeps skipping all around on the tracks. I thought it was the first disc, but the others did it too. It may start on track 8, skip to track 32, and then back to track 14. This doesn't work for her or me. I thought it was my CD player, but when I tried it elsewhere, it was the same. I will return it.Thank youJanet Herzog

"Author is out of touch with the show..: Another in a long list of Buffy books which are shockingly out of touch with the show after season 3.

"YAWN: This book was like torture. So boring and I could have cared less about the characters. I tried really hard to get into it but I swear every time I tried to read more than 10 pages I fell asleep or couldn't even figure out what the author was trying to tell me. I never made it past the midpoint of the book. I saw someone picking it up in the bookstore the other day and told them ""don't waste your time or your money"". Honestly how did this book win awards ? The only award it should win is ""The Sleeping Pill Award""

"Mismatch: I expected a dry, technical manual, so I'm not disappointed that it is. It may be very useful for a tennis instructor to show a point or diagram during a lesson, but without an in-person demonstration by someone that already knows the point being taught, the book is not helpful. The pictures are an integral part of this book, at least as important as the text. In a technical manual, illustrations ought to be painstakingly crystal clear, ideally a photograph and/or a clean, precise and anatomically correct drawing. What this book has instead are paintings that are almost impressionistic in nature, anatomically and positionally vague, rendering the overall work completely worthless as a self-study tool for tennis.

"Stay Away From This Stinker: I read the previous book by Rosenberg thought it was going somewhere interesting when she pulled the old TWIN TRICK. Even though it was free, I should have been smart enough not to waste my time with this one, but I was curious about the characters from the other book who behave so differently from that one as to be recognizable only by their names.What Rosenberg did, I think, was write a plot outline and twist her characters into pretzels to try to stay within the outlines. Nobody is believable; even the major lies in the book don't pass any reader's smell test EXCEPT FOR OUR HEROINE who is a human pinball, bouncing off one BS story after another and treating her family as second class citizens while cleaving to the tales of a proven sociopath.The ending isn't very satisfying either.By the way, the Kindle version is so riddled with typos it looks like a first proof. Even free sometimes costs too much.

"Still not working, no hope that it ever will.: Got this remote for the holidays, still not working. Have tried at least 10 times. Setup SEEMS easy, but then when using it in the real world, my devices go crazy. Every time is something different, things turning on and off wrong, different modes. We even tried eliminating our surround sound box, and only have a TV and cable box now. No good. Emailed customer service twice. No response. Called customer service, was on hold so long (>30 min) I gave up. I am a programmer, and I still can't get this to work. Seems like a complete waste of money. It looks cool though. Maybe it's just a prop from ""Minority Report!""

So much negativity that I became a bit depressed and just couldn't finish the book. I went outside and sat under a glowing delightful sun that afternoon. I began to feel very sorry for Mr. Carlin. Life is too short to spend it with such a negative worldview. I cannot imagine how empty you must be if you found this book funny, and I am glad I don't know you. You are probably as toxic as Mr. Carlin himself.

"Crossroads of Boredom: Now I have been a huge fan of the WOT series. Books 1-6 were absolutely awesome. After ""Lord of Chaos"" the series started to die down. ""Crown of Swords"" was an ok addition, ""Path of Daggers"" started the slow movement of the plot, ""Winters Heart"" almost brought the story to a standstill, but with this new addition ""Crossroads of Twilight"" RJ has brought the WOT series to an all time low. This book contained 678 pages of pointless detail. The highpoints in this book as far as im concerned were Mat's brief encounters with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Rands VERY brief appearances. To summarize you could read about three chapters of this book and still know enough not to be lost when the next one comes out. And since RJ is taking his sweet time releasing these you can expect the next one some time in 2007!!!

"Works, but it's slow: This unit is a re-packaged SanDisk SD card. Bear this in mind as you search the net for benchmarks that compare the relative speed of various SD cards.In my Palm Tungsten T, the card performs very poorly, particularly on writes.

"Below my expections: This was not my first experience with a digital camera. After receiving the Kodak 3700 I thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on. The main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas. Unless very close the picture was very dark. Just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program. The delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired. The final reason for returning the camera was the incompatibility with the latest Mac technology just released.When all returns are cleared I am going to opt for a Canon 110 or A20 or Nikon coolpix. Family members and friends have these and are very satisfied.

This is seriously the loudest thing I have ever heard in my entire life. At first you'll think the thing is just warming up, and after about 10 more minutes of it you'll think its broken. Finally, you'll realize that its just loud. It sounds like you've got front row seats at a NASCAR race or you're actually on the space ship thats launching into space, but no, its just this new heater that you bought. Don't buy this thing unless its for your deaf brother, but it might even be too loud for him.

"I am a Quaker: One of the things I like about the Society of Friends is that no one can claim to speak for it, and that includes me. However, I have found all this author's works to be different from any Quakerism I've experienced.

"Depressing but in a Bad Way: I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus. I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's ""The Passion of the Jew"" (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other).

"Awful: I kept waiting for the movie to begin... and then it ended. In the meantime I had to endure a tiresome barrage of ""isn't Japan weird,"" pseudo-quirky, stereotypical tripe. Add to this the fact that I'm supposed to be empathizing with the two lead characters, both of whom are your average, everyday wealthy globetrotters, and the sum is a movie that I could barely sit through. There wasn't even any nudity relief.Makes me wonder what the big reviewers would have said if the director didn't have a famous last name. Or what would have been said if the movie had given a different ethnic group the same belittling treatment.

"Arrrggghh!: With its warm, original premise and Oscar-pedigree cast, this could have been a decent ""family values"" kind of movie if it wasn't sabotaged in its dying moments by an utterly pointless surprise climax and a hideously mawkish ending. It skirts self-indulgence for 100 minutes then drives full speed over the brink. But without the emotional setup this kind of ending requires, rather than weeping you'll probably be rolling your eyes. The film runs slightly long, but thankfully the performances from Spacey, Hunt and ""that kid"" (Haley Joel Osment) are magnificent throughout, so at least there's something interesting to look at - other than your watch. On paper, this must have looked like gold: a best-selling novel, an Academy-blessed cast, and even the music from ""American Beauty"". Proof yet again that films designed to garner Oscars rarely do.

"Not OSX Compatible!: This printer is not compatible with macintosh computers. The fact that any printer needs a driver with today's technology is a joke, and evidence of how cheap HP has become.For anyone buying this printer for Windows, good luck with the instructions! The 11 step process of installing the printer has been efficiently translated into 1. remove shipping tape, 2. install accessories, ... load paper, connect power.Other than these problems the printer works fine, but I will only use it to print the test page. Buy at your own risk.Oh yeah, HP cut every single corner they could with this thing. It does not include a USB cable. The instructions are on one sheet of paper! Seriously HP, even your $40 calculators come with 100+ page user manuals. I don't want to sit on hold with support to save you money.

They found nothing wrong and it was starting OK again. Took it home, drove it everday, things were OK, drove it every other day, things were OK, drove it every third day, WOULD NOT START!!

"worst movie ever: I guess I should have researched to see that this was a remake of an original, but I didn't. The previews looked decent, the posters & dvd cover looked interesting; the actual movie was an extreme disappointment. Never have I been so glad I didn't see a movie in the theater. Perhaps a die hard feminist might like this movie, perhaps because I'm a male is why I hated it; all I know is that I can't remember the last time I was so ticked off to see credits roll. This movie had potential to be good, but the odds of a decent ending got worse and worse and could only have happened if a frickin' nuke had landed on the island and killed all inhabitants. In summation, don't pay more than $2 to watch this movie, it's not worth much more than that.

"Not what I thought: This is NOT was I thought it was. I was hopeing for a cool book with nice pictures and ideas for victorian decorating but this is mostly a READING book about the subject. It think it goes more into the history of Victorian decor and do's and donts more so than picture ideas.

"This guy needs to be scared at what he's saying.: This guy is saying not to spank kids. That's ridiculous. In my opinion, spanking kids is right. Not hitting. Not beating. Spanking. Not as hard as you can. But spanking nontheless. I am outraged at this guy, who obviously never even CONSIDERED, the slightest POSSIBILITY that the other side might be right. I hope he knows what he's doing: his kids, and kids that he knew, that he said not to discipline, and that he didn't discipline, may become the adults who shrug and either throw him into the nursing home or go the path of enuthasia. Not trying to be cruel, but that's a warning: If we don't train kids now, actively and effectively, then we are doomed.And BTW, this is coming from someone who is older than eight and younger than thirteen.

"Probably not the real thing....: So I ordered this product, very excited that it was only $22.50 for 1 oz of Nina Ricci L'air du temps Eau de toilette for my mother. It arrived quickly. However, when I opened the shipping box, the familiar yellow box was not shrink-wrapped as I usually find in the store. On further inspection of the perfume inside the dove bottle appeared to be plastic instead of the usual glass dove bottle I am so familiar to seeing. When I sprayed it, it smelled overly strong but then the scent faded quickly. I am not sure as it came directly from Amazon but it seems fake. Everywhere else sells the 1 oz perfume for around $44. I am wondering if it was so cheap because it is not actually the real perfume.

"Amsterdam---a disappointment: McEwan is a master at letting us into the minds and hearts of the creative and successful upper middle and upper classes of British society. He does a marvelous job of this in Amsterdam for the first 80% of this brief novel. However, the novel rushes foolishly toward its ending once the two main characters actually leave the U.K. and go off to Amsterdam. I got the feeling that the author was in a quandary as to end the novel and so he chose a rather silly and cliched ending more in keeping with Agatha Christie than the beautifully nuanced writer that McEwan can be. Read ""Saturday"" or ""On Chesil Beach"" but leave Amsterdam in Europe.

"Antiquated software: We used this software for our wedding invitations a while back. To be kind, it's antiquated. Note in the description that it is designed to run on Windows 3.x (which predates Win95, Win98, and Win2K) ... there is a reason why it says that. Although MyMailList can manage a mail list and print out a variety of label and evelope formats (including custom ones), the user interface is pretty clunky compared with current software. We're about to send out another mailing and we're not going to use this any more; we're looking for new software.

"Great product, lousy support: The 5160 is my second ReplayTV unit. I also have a 4508 that I just love.My problem with the 5160 is that you have to download a humongous operating system update from SonicBlue's network before you can do anything with it, and SonicBlue's network isn't robust enough to handle all the download requests it seems to be getting this Christmas season. My connection kept timing out an hour or two into the download, and as a result it took me three days of trying to finally complete the setup process. Meanwhile, SonicBlue's tech support department was no help at all. Sometimes I couldn't even get through; other times the wait to speak to a representative was over an hour.I'm a fan of SonicBlue's products, but I'd hold off on the 5160 until SonicBlue works the kinks out. To capitalize on the holiday buying season, SonicBlue seems to have rushed these units out the door before they were ready.

"This book was silly and unimaginative.: I purchased this book after reading a ""news article"" in the author's city's newspaper. I was immediately suspicious of the child's ability to write a short children's fiction chapter book and after reading the book my suspicions were well founded. It appears that the child's father who ""edited"" the book may have put a lot more than a few suggestions in.The story of ""Gerf,"" the spherical imaginery friend, was boring, unimaginative, and certainly was not worth $8.99.Also let it be known that the book was self published and was never sought after by ANY real publisher. According to the ""news article"" the boy's father had the book published by the self publishing company ""booksurge"" (you can visit this company at booksurge.com) for at least $899.The author will be better off giving this book out to his friends at school and possibly his grandma.

I thought maybe my particular unit was defective; I returned it for another one and the same thing happened. This model is just bad. Unfortunate, since I've used many other excellent Cuisinart products.

"We Need a US/North America DVD NOW!!: It is unconscionable that one of THE Greatest Films of all time is STILL not available on DVD in North America. What in the world is the problem??BTW, for the reviewer who mentioned that Bogey ""didn't sound British""; you need to pay attention--early in the film Bogey's character (Charlie) is clearly identified as CANADIAN. Eh? But of course, during the era depicted (1914) Canada was a Dominion of the British Empire, and still used the ""Union Jack"" as their national flag. (The Canadian ""Red Ensign"" was adopted in late 1943; the ""Maple Leaf flag"" in 1967).Nevertheless--bring us THE AFRICAN QUEEN!! Say ""NO"" to Bootlegs!!

"Captivating Images, Simplistic History: My mind and imagination were captivated by the film footage. That alone makes the documentary worth viewing.There are several inaccuracies of fact, ones that should have been easy to capture as they require no specialist knowledge.The main problem I have with the film is the inordinate amount of time spent on various crimes & ills of Stalin.Not that this information about Josef Stalin isn't interesting, a-lot of it doesn't seem very relevant.And the film sheds no light on Stalin or his crimes. According to the narrative tens of millions were murdered by Stalin because he was paranoid, megalomaniac, addicted to power, etc. No time is spent at all on Stalin's ideology. It would sound pretty ridiculous if someone argued that ""Hitler"" killed so many Jews because he had a thirst for power or he liked violence.Lots of problems with the narrative, but the series can't help but to make emotional impact.

I love the movie and was really looking forward to checking out all the extra features, but unfortunately it's locked to region A.Lets hope it gets an international release soon!

"Very bad product quality: Both the microphone did not work. One has no light; the other had light and synced with the receiver albeit on wrong side but still did not work. Terrible manufacturing. It seemed manufacturer never tested the unit before packaging it. Got a refund but not the shipping cost.

"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PLASMA: I have bought this TV in June. It has not worked for 15 days properly. Picture comes up for 30 min and it goes off and the screen is just with white lines all over, and the TV gets so hot we shut down for few min (when it works). It works once a day. Picture quality is not good. Repair guys took 2 months to figure out what the problem is. After 4-8 new parts in it, it worked for 20 days again back to the same problem. Customer Service of Toshiba ""New Technology and New Problems"". No HELP AT ALL FROM THEM. Do not take my word. I am putting the Phone Number of the Repair center: 770-451-5057 and my case #: 281270. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TV.

"The sound quality is not so hot: I got mine yesterday, returning it today. I changed the headphones of course, but the sound quality does not come anywhere close at all to the new Sony S2 Sports Walkman. I like to hear the clarity in the background on vocals and guitars, but with the new shuffle, these sounds blended together and sounded rather dull. I know I will be in the minority here, but if you are open minded and want awesome sound quality, there are far better choices out there.If one brand is all you have ever tried, one brand is all you will ever know.I admit that it looks great though!Sony Model in comparison was: Sony NW-S203F 1 GB

"This product is flaky: I'm really disappointed by the quality of this product on my Macbook Pro. It does not run well on Leopard (actually it sometimes does NOT run at all) and seems to be quite buggy.My experience with VMWare (on much slower hardware) was much better than Parallels but to be fair I've never used VMWare on Macs.The support is also not all that good.

"purple prose, weak melodrama: Whats annoying is that the author passes this all off as autobigraphical and historically true, when it is NOT. YH was/is from a very elite background, and like other expats making bucks off of US readers in search of melodramas of oppressed Chinese, this works poorly as history or politics. MOreover, the prose is labored and purple, though this might be the translation's fault.

"Misleading Work: The book (which I read in a library) is very weak in original ideas, research, and scholarship. The author presents nothing believable about his case (that the de la Pena Diary is a fake) that can be taken seriously by anyone. Just recently the de la Pena Diary was auctioned off for nearly quarter million dollars! Not bad for a work that Mr. Groneman wants to call a fake in his 'curio' of a work.

"Not loud enough.: I have bought other speakers before and they have all been excellent for sound. These speakers however are not loud enough for my bedroom TV. They have a great sound but just not loud enough. They may be great for desktop computers or other devices that are less than 10 feet from you. I would recommend them for computer games and such but not for TV speakers at all.

"Short Life Span LCD Monitor: The L4AX 14 inch LCD monitor from KOGI ran for just over a year then quit. The new GVision repair facility in Lake Forest, CA (949) 586-3338 wanted $45.00 just to look at it, then would add the cost of any parts needed. From the other reviews, these monitors suffer from short life spans and probable non-existent quality control checks at the factory. Suggest readers buy a well-known brand of LCD monitor, one that has been around for several years like Princeton, for example.

"Very Scary for Tots: A very nice looking movie, the special effects made the dinosaurs look that much more realistic. The story itself was pretty bland...somewhere down amonst the lesser Disney films like ""The Fox and the Hound"" But the violence in the movie really detracted from the movie.I bought this movie for my 4 year old son. The first Dinosaur attack had him screaming and in tears. I shut the movie off after the big dinosaur looked like he was going to start snapping the heads off the little ""monkeys"", and watched the rest after he was in bed.You may want to consider potential nightmares for youngsters (which my son has had for a few nights). Too bad Disney didn't opt to make a more family-oriented movie like ""Song of the South"" or ""Bambi"".

"Extreemly Disappointing!: As a college football fanatic, I could hardly wait to get my new book for the coffee table, but I have been disappointed since the moment I opened it. First, the pictures are of very poor quality (grainy in many cases) and are not at all engaging. Some photos depict an empty stadium shot from many feet above! To make matters worse, the description that accompanies each stadium is very mundane. If you want a book to flip through once, then this may be for you. If you desire a book that emanates the college football spirit, I would recommened looking elsewhere.

"Poor Quality: I'm sorry to give a negative review, but I'm afraid this product deserves it. I ordered the Pearlessence Spa Mist Air and was unpleasantly surprised by the cheap quality of the plastic used to construct this thing. The price was great, but it just wasn't worth it and I returned it. I can't recommend this at all.I've used a different ultrasonic diffuser in the past that was absolutely fantastic! You can see a similar product on amazon by doing a find for the Ultrasonic Misting DIFFUSER by Young Living (which I'm sorry to say is way overpriced). I think there's one Japanese company that makes these units, and then different companies take the units and brand them for themselves. I wish Amazon carried one of these at a reasonable price because I would order one in a heartbeat. They are high quality and work fabulously.

"Expats Party From Paris to Pamplona: I have actually heard more than one person say that ""The Sun Also Rises"" is their favorite book. I have no idea why they would say that. Maybe I just didn't ""get it.""The novel revolves around five English-speaking expatriates who spend their time drinking and carousing their way from Paris to a festival in Pamplona. The four men in the group are all in love with the one woman to some extent. And the woman has affection of some type for each of the men.There is some humorous drunken dialogue from time to time. There are some good descriptions of bullfighting and trout fishing . Beyond that, there is not much to recommend ""The Sun Also Rises.""There is very little story to be told. The book reads like the travel journal of a lovesick person that has been translated from another language into English. Perhaps it just hasn't aged as well as some of Hemingway's other work. ""The Sun Also Rises"" was lost on me.

"World's loudest toy: My son was given this dump truck as a present. It's sturdy and well-made, but unfortunately, it is deafening! I'm no stranger to loud toys: I have 4 kids and we have our share of noisy toys -- but this truck is far-and-away the LOUDEST toy any of my children have ever had. When my son plays with this tuck, the music and recorded truck sounds can be heard all over the house -- even on different floors and through closed doors. Not only does my son say the truck is ""really loud,"" and refer to it as ""my loud truck,"" but his siblings get annoyed by the loud noise whenever he plays with it, even if they are in a different room.It's a nice toy, but it would be much improved by either adding a volume control switch, or just taking the volume down a notch or two . . . or ten.

"Boring ... a big disappointment.: As much as i respect Ian Irvine's effort in writing this book i have to say that, ""A Shadow on the Glass,"" is a big disappointment. I have read many fantasy novels by numerous authors and none of them not even the worst of them was as bad as this one was. For example, Ian goes on and on describing the surroundings in so, so much detail that made me feel dizzy and sleepy! Then there is this problem of stretching the story of one character for so long! He talks about Karan and her confrontation with the Whelms chapter after chapter after chapter! I thought it'll never end! Excitement level = Zero. I threw the book away just before reaching half way because i got so bored. It just didn't have the ""It grabbed me from the start"" element.

"Weak: This is The Beatles' weakest album. Seven Lennon/McCartney songs, one Harrison and the other six are cover versions. Isn't that sort of pathetic? I mean, the White Album had 25 Lennon/McCartney songs and they were almost seperated by then! Most of the songs are bad.""It Won't Be Long"" is alright. About average.""All I've Got to Do"" is horrible.""All My Loving"" is alright, sort of""Don't Bother Me"" is probably the best song on the album. It's Great""Little Child"" is good, too""Till There Was You"" is good""Please Mister Postman"" is dumb""Roll Over Beethoven"" is sort of bland""Hold Me Tight"" is the WORST song on the album""You Really Got a Hold On Me"" is boring""I Want to Be Your Man"" is too repetitive""Devil In Her Heart"" is boring""Not a Second Time"" is really, really boring""Money"" is excellentSo, in all, the only good ones are ""Little Child"" ""Don't Bother Me"" ""Till There Was You"" and ""Money""Not The Beatles' best work. ""Please Please Me"" or even ""Beatles For Sale"" would be a better choice.

"terrible product: This product was never even used. We managed to get it tangled and jammed just in the process of setting it up, and it didn't take much to cause this to happen - I had read the caution about how easy it was to tangle. After fighting with it for a few hours we gave up. As another reviewer stated (which I should have taken as a bad omen) it would be helpful if the plastic casing would open so you could get the line unjammed. My husband called the company who won't take any action on their own. At the price it's not worth my effort to package up and return, so it went in the garbage.

"Clueless Author Comes to Mind: Save your money, do not buy this book as you may find out you know more about the subject of bookmaking than the authors.Evidence of the authors cluelessness, in the book they write, ""there are no winning gamblers"".

Just ask any Las Vegas sportsbook as they escort another pro from their casino sportsbook threatening arrest if they should return. There are more false writings throughout the book.

"Can't hold a charge: We bought this battery to have a backup for our camera before we went on a trip. I was sure to read the instructions and followed them exactly, charging it multiple times as instructed to be sure it would hold a charge. However, regardless of doing exactly what the instructions said, when I needed the backup battery it was dead. We charged it again that night and it again was dead the next morning. It was a waste of money.

"Not very effective.: I have owned external antennas in the past with other phones and they have worked very well. I purchased this antenna because I recently purchased a new phone and needed a new antenna because I live in a dead spot.. The antenna made no difference. I can actually use my phone without the antenna, but the signal breaks up every few minutes, I thought that perhaps this would give it an extra boost, but sometimes I think it made it worse, I actually just went back to using my phone without the antenna.

"No Subtitles: I give this item only 1 star but that is not because of the movie, I would have given the movie probably 5 stars, but it is because of the lack of subtitles. It's the same all over again. Just as I would have bought a lot of the Warner Archives I also would buy a lot of the 20th Century Fox Archives series, if they only had subtitles. This way I think a lot of people are missing very good movies they otherwise would have bought. There is no other way tomake this clear than by giving 1 star in the hope that the companies should see it and give us subtitles, this could not be so expensive as the price if those bare-boned DVD-R's is expensive enough. And they must realzie there are a lot of peo-ple for who subtitles are necessary. I know I have written this already several times but I hope by repeating it the companies will pay attention, after all I think they would be pleased to sell more of these expensive DVD-R's.

"weak motor, low capacity: Bought this after our beloved Braun grinder's top broke. Very disappointed in the product.

"Pathetic Losers: These guys aren't the Florida band who released 2 great albums on Capricorn in the early 70s. They instead are pathetic posers who, when confronted that they were in fact using a copyrighted name of an existing band, showed their stupid, nasty and rude selves immediately. It says something that everyone but these bozos knew about the name already being in use, but then some people are just plain stuck under a rock with their own little stupid excuse for a life. Add to that the fact that this album is way past useless, and it's easy to see there's a special place waiting in hell for their pathetic carcasses.

"Disappointed: The meditations are excerpts from various works, but it's too disjointed. Because they are taken out of context they often don't make sense to me and are therefore not inspiring at all. If I was very familiar with his work and a big fan, then I'd possibly like it.

"This story could have been told very differently ...: It is just too bad. After going through this book myself, I asked my wife to look at it. It was a no brainer - there was no WAY we were going to let our little girl read it. Cursing, explicit body parts, etc. I can't believe someone actually thinks this is appropriate for middle-school girls. I can see what the author was trying to accomplish, but the way the story was conveyed really leaves a lot to be desired. All the bad language and sexual subject matter could easily have been left out. There is simply too much of what is wrong, and not enough of what is right. I hope that in the future she decides to take a different path when she writes for young ladies. As a group they need something that inspires them and serves as a model for good behavior, not something like this.

"All right, but could use ALOT of fixing up: It's fairly good but there are major flaws. First of all, When you opened a saved game, all the planes you had at youre airport are gone.

"Tastes Great but Less Filling: First of all I love(d ?)Skillet. The composition and arrangement of the music is always first rate, and this continues on this album. The sound quality, energy and excitement in their albums is always high, and this continues on this album. Their lyrics are always uncompromising, unashamedly Christian, and not shy about using the name of Jesus, and this is absolutely missing on this album. Lyrically what you get is Christianity lite, and Christianity in disguise. Oh don't get me wrong there is Christianity on this album, you'll just have to look for it, where in their other albums it was in the open for all to see. Skillet used to be my favorite lyrical band, and they also stood out as Christian leaders. Now they wear ""The Exploited"" t-shirts, and hide their faith. Where is the lyrical courage and genius of ""I Can?"" Seems to me like they're taking over the world by assimilating to it.

"A GPS, a paper clip and a map: We were so happy when we bought our first GPS unit 8 months ago.But our experience with TomTom GO510 has been a frustrating one.The unit requires frequent resets, sometimes right in the middle of unfamiliar places.If we ever forgot to bring a pin, we had to resort to the good old map to get us out of the jam.To TomTom's credit, it did replace promptly our dead unit after initial 2 months of use.But the unit consistently failed to find our California home, even after a most recent map update. Granted, the housing development was only about 2 years old. But, we had reported its coordinates to TomTom right after we received the unit.It was even more ridiculous when the unit reported errors during a recent route computationfrom New Jersey to the JFK Airport.TomTom 510 is not worth the price.

"Disgusted!! I didn't even want to give the one star!!!: I never thought Tommy Lee would leave me feeling so disappointed. I'm glad I rented this movie first. I was left feeling very empty after watching. Definitely would not recommend this to my worst enemy. Watching this movie was like a punishement. I wish I would have turned this off in the first 10 minutes instead of watching until the bitter end. This was one of those movies for me that I just had to keep watching to see if anything worth while happened. Well I didn't see anything worth watching. I watched this Saturday night, it is now Monday morning & I feel like I'm still recovering from one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. If there was a point it went right over my head!!! Save yourself a whole lot of pain & agony & avoid this one. I actually feel disgusted with myself for seeing this movie through until the end.

"Gevalia freebie better than this: I don't want to give this ANY stars, but I had to give it one.I have never had a Mr. Coffee maker last. The free coffee makers from Gevalia make better coffee and last longer than any Mr. Coffee ever has and this one did not fail to disappoint.The insulated carafe would work great IF the coffee coming out were hot, as opposed to just over lukewarm. And there is NO heat in the plate to aid getting or keeping it hot. If you preset it, there's no way to pre-heat the carafe, so with the lukewarm coffee, the cold carafe and no heating plate I always have tepid coffee that I have to microwave to reheat in the morning.And, true to Mr. Coffee, it quit working after a few weeks.Well, back to Gevalia.

"Stick with the regular Missing Pieces and save some money: I think Autograph is one of the most underrated hair bands of the 80s. Being a big fan of their music, I was interested to learn that there was an import version of Missing Pieces that had seven additional tracks on it. I plunked down my $25.00 just to hear those seven tracks. Upon listening to the CD, I quickly realized that five of the seven extra tracks are simply rough demos of songs on their first album ""Sign in Please."" I was dissapointed to say the least. The rehashed songs coupled with a printing error in the liner notes, make me regret spending the cash for this import CD. If you are an Autograph fan, stick with the American version of Missing Pieces and save yourself fifteen bucks.

"Not Well Designed: This heater is over designed and inconvenient to use. It heats your space as well as any other personal heater, but the thermostat provides no additional control over an ""On/Off"" switch. And the handle grips on the sides give you no leverage at all in moving it around. It takes both hands to pick it up which is very awkward - especially if the heater is under your desk. I purchased two other heaters from different manufacturers at the same time and they are far easier to manage because they have handles on top. They were also less expensive and provide the same heat output. This one isn't worth the extra cost.

"Maybe: Three video clips from German TV , lots of swirling backgrounds and colours but lots of Live Deep Purple too.This release could be considered worth the purchase price for the version of No,no,no alone, where Richie Blackmore shows he is a very underated player indeed as he kicks this tune along with consumate ease. He just makes playing the guitar look effortless.The version of Highway star suffers a little from Ian Gillan fooling around with the lyrics and tune but both this and Hallelujah are sure to be of interest to Purple fans.The DVD jukebox would have been better without the cheap and uninspiring advertising that almost ruins Emerson Lake and Palmer and stops me from watching more than 10 seconds of any one else.Shoddy.

"Content good, writing quality poor: I saw a UTube video with this missionary telling the story of his experiences. It was entertaining and delightful - in part due to his facial expressions and his particular brand of English. (He is Dutch) However, the book in an attempt to present the exact words of the missionary, fell far short of presenting the story in an engaging literary manner. It fell flat. The message is still there, but the grammar is poor and someone who did not understand the reason for this poor writing style might well wonder why they had paid any money at all for this book.

Not like cookie dough, and not like peanut butter. More like I would expect silly putty to taste, like chemical treated plastic. I had two and tried giving the rest of them away to people at my gym. Everyone took one, no one came back for a second. I'd say they failed the taste test.If you're looking for peanut butter flavors, go withMet-Rx Big Colossal Peanut-Butter Pretzel Bar, 3.52 oz. (pack of 12), it's fantastic, and I've gone through a dozen boxes of those in the last year. Maybe they just spoiled my taste buds for anything else.

"Movies That Suck: I bought this movie used for $3.00. Unfortunately, it is not worth 3 cents. This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and believe me I tried and tried. As a long-time Terry Pratchett fan I am horrified! Jeremy Irons, Tim Curry and Sean Astin. All actors I love. All doing complete crap in this movie. It was embarassing to watch. Don't bother with this total loser, you will regret it.

"Two-hit Wonders: I bought this album as a teen in the 60s, got rid of it by decade's end, but recently purchased the expanded CD on the strength of the terrific ""Rumors"" on the new ""Love Is the Song We Sing"" box set. But my teen self was right: aside from ""Rumors"" and the sassy ""Little Girl,"" the CD consists mostly of weak covers and derivitive originals. (Even ""Rumors"" nicks its chorus from Donovan's ""The Trip."") The SoS could play in a variety of musical styles, but that doesn't make up for the overall blandness.

"Another substandard waste of plastic: All of these movies are already available on their own single DVD. Why would anyone simply cram a random bunch of horror films on to 2 DVDs & repackage them as a new product? With landfills overflowing & the ability to stream the movies online readily available, it is a complete waste to put these out again in a substandard package. If you're going to do it, do it right, namely HD remasters in 1080p on blu ray & perhaps some bonus material not previously included.

"Loses suction: I purchased the First Years Natural Comfort Double Electric/ Battery breast pump and it lost suction after using it once a day for only three weeks. The box recommends this product for full time use, so it should have lasted longer. I called customer service and they are sending me another motor free of charge, but I've been without a pump for about two weeks now and my milk supply in the freezer is running low! Also, the breast shields cut into your nipple and leave marks around your areola (when the suction is actually working!). Also, alot of precious milk leaks out of the breast shields when you are done pumping and remove the shields from your breasts. This product is horrible! Plus, you can't get your money back or return it to the store. I've decided to purchase the Medela Pump in Style Advanced, which I should have done in the first place! Don't waste your money on any of this company's breast pumps. Put your money toward a Medela.

"Disappointing: Easy reading but ultimately not satisfying. The central character wasn't very appealing, and acted like a jerk a lot of the time (he's 50-something and complimented himself for restraint in not having sex with an underage teenage girl; plus his interactions with police were pretty juvenile). Book was too long for the subject matter with a few too many side trips down memory lane. It gave a little detail about tarot cards, but so does Wikipedia. Not recommended.
",-1
"I was disappointed...: In every chapter Ms. DeLong talks about all the evil white males that she is pursuing and working besides. A personality conflict with a boss is turned into a sexist hate campaign by Ms. DeLong. One of the reasons I bought this book was to read about the UNABOM case and instead we find out all she did was watch a bus stop. Then the reader is treated with her lover spats that she had with her FBI lover during her four month stake out of the bus stop.However, this book does go into the politics of government law enforcement and shows the black and white thinking that most government law enforcement agents have. Ms DeLong was not a model FBI agent and was forced into retirement.

"Worst Racing Game Ever!: Not only is this game severely limited and restricted in terms of gameplay but the huge clumsly trucks are hardly the best kind of vehicles to be racing in.King Of Route 66 is one of the most linear, non-interactive games I have ever played. The racing locations are lifeless, the trucks are cumbersome and hard to control, you only get to choose between 3 different trucks to begin with, there's way too much repetition and zero excitement.Racing games, by their very nature, are kind of limited in what is possible but this is the worst. Get GTA: Vice City and play that. It's everything a game about cars/trucks/vehicles of any kind should be. Leave this drek alone.

"Complete Waste of Money: I bought these castanets for a flamenco class and am very disappointed. The castanet string included with these is an ineffective synthetic which does NOT work all and is not recommended for playing.I have to buy a new pair, and the return policy of the seller is ridiculous. Do NOT NOT NOT buy these castanets. They are terrible and unplayable.Having said that, I think these were the cheapest ones I saw advertised, so once again I learn the hard way that ""You get what you pay for.""

"If you own this, you should jump in front of a bus.: First of all I just want to say that 2003 was a repeat of the past 6 or so years of music. Along with this joke called Chingy, there has been a nonstop influx of idiots with no talent who are polluting the airwaves with mindless, commercial, garbage. Music is supposed to be an artform. Chingy is showing the world that you can take a mish-mosh of mispronounced words thrown over some wack beats and still make millions because 99% of music fans are mindless sheep who will buy anything that they see on TV so they can blast it in their cavalier with fake 20 inch chrome wheels. Bottom line is that Chingy is terrible, the mojority of rap albums that were released this year are complete trash, and the people who continue to buy this stuff should be catapulted into the sun.

"Unsweetened banana chips: I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened. I wanted some with just a little sweetness but not as sweet as what is normally on the market. However - I don't like to say anything bad about anything but these absolutely taste like cardboard - there is absolutely NO taste ( you would never guess you were eating bananas if you were blindfolded) and the texture is like cardboard also. I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN. Sorry... wish I could say something positive about these but I can't in all honestly.

"These boys have some 'splaining to do...: I have enjoyed Preston-Child books ever since I read Relic. Full of action and adventure and even some gratuitous violence and blood thrown in for fun. I had always thought some of the peripheral characters would be explained at some point in time. Unless I've missed something, the history of Constance and Wren have still not been explained. It's starting to get a little annoying.I feel that there were also alot of other loose ends just in this story alone, including the psychological profiler....why even include it? And the Margo Green issue was just a cheap shot that wasn't even explained very well.Furthermore, the latest books by this team are lacking the intense scare factor of earlier works.

"Cheap!!!: The Table-Mate 11 Folding Table is the cheapest, poorly constructed TV table I've ever seen. After putting the 4 tables together (one of them chipped a plastic part during assembly), we placed our food on the trays and they immediately collapsed, spewing food everywhere! When I returned the trays, without any reason given, I was charged a restocking fee and denied a credit for the chipped plastic off one table. It took 2 emails in order to get an explanation for the reduced amount credited back to my card. I would never do business with this company again!

"Awful.: This is one really awful CD. I can't really stand Kidz Bop, but I wouldn't even think of buying this trash. I've just heard some of the songs. There IS going to be a Kidz Bop 9, and it's probably going to be just as rubbish as this is. What's going to be on volume 9 then?Another U2 song being runied? Yet ANOTHER Nickleback song totally not meant for kids? Another Kelly Clarkson song which will end up being buchered? I dread to think. And I don't want to listen to any of them either. So I'm not going to listen to these ones this time. I've had enough. Don't buy ANY of the Kidz Bop CDs.What's happened to this world? Will the dreadful sound and music of Kidz Bop ever end?

"What a stinker!: How could such a star-powered cast have ever agreed to act in this bomb? Did they even read the script? And what was Sean Penn thinking? How many nature shots do we have to have to substitute for plot developments? What heavy-handed directing, particularly the storm clouds gathering! Duh. The camera, as always, loves Nicholson but that does not make up for a real bad script and a really bad job of directing. I don't know how many times I looked at my watch, anxious for the ending, which, in itself, was a flop as well.

"Nothing past the title track: Look, I'm probably one of the bigger Y&T; fans you'll meet. I have long asked for more of the band's A&M; recordings to be re-released in the U.S., and have on many an occasion considered Y&T; the single most underrated band in the history of metal. But bands put out good and bad albums, and ""Contagious,"" which others have noted is Jimmy DeGrasso's first album and Joey Alves' last with the band, is not all that good.""Contagious"" starts well with the title track, but from then on, there's really not much. ""The Kid Goes Crazy"" is another of those comic tracks, like ""Barroom Boogie"" before it, but doesn't quite live up to the standard. The rest is filler, plain and simple, though Dave Meniketti shows how much soul a guitar can put out at the end with ""I'll Cry For You.""Download the title song. Skip the rest.

"ALL LOOKS AND NO TALENT, PONCE CANT CARRY A TUNE.: Carlos Ponce was brought into latin music for one reason, and one reason only...his looks. He was a popular soap star in his home country, than Emilio Estefan (Glorias Husband) molded him into the next Ricky Martin wannabe. Ponce has no drive, no passion, or voice. Just listen to ""Rezo"" it is just a latin dance mess with very poor vocals. An obvious look that packaging comes before talent. If you want Latin music than try Ricky Martins ""Vuelve"" or his latest ""Ricky Martin"", otherwise trash this one....a definite miss.

"Not worth a dime without the theatrical versions!: The 2011 Blu-ray release will NOT include the theatrical versions of the original films. Instead they will include only the special feature versions with all of the unnecessary and distracting computer generated special effects that Lucas added years later. If Lucas wants to re-write the films, he should re-shoot the entire movies. Simply inserting a few minutes of special effects using the latest whiz-bang technology into a film made with older technology is completely distracting. Furthermore the additions add nothing to the story line and are totally unnecessary. Save your money until they sell a blu-ray release that includes the original theatrical versions. Lucas did the same thing when the series first came out on DVD - he included only the special feature versions in the first release. A few years later he released a set that included both the special feature versions and the original theatrical versions.

"VOO-DOO OR REVOLUTION??: I should have known this movie was in trouble when the credits said 'somewhere in Latin America.' That ambiguous statement is usually reserved for TV cereal productions.The movie runs 133 and if you were to just catch the last five minutes of this flick it would be enough. The story meanders , the dialog is trite and the only reason I stayed until the end, was, I couldn't believe Javier Bardem would be wasted on on a movie which could not make up its' mind; if the Latin American country where this took place was having the makings of a Revolution or a psychotic voo doo happening.John M. has always been spooky to me , he likes those dark and ""Ha, Ha, bet you cannot figure me out"" characters in most of his movies. But, if this is his Directorial debut, he has not much to offer his fans.Javier Bardem and his side kick Juan Diego Botto are the only light in a otherwise very dark movie.I give this flick a 21/2 out of 5 mainly for those two actors.ciao ...

"Outdated and Alarmist: It is obvious why a new edition of this book has not been released. The predicted ""youth crimewave"" never materialized. This book can provide some valuable insight into the development of a young mind and the supposed damage that certain environmental factors may or may not have on a child's development. The text reads much like an episode of America's Most Wanted, dramatic and alarmist. They would have been much better off just citing the statistics in a journal article than force one to ""sort"" through the needlessly wordy chapters.They do bring to light some important and often overlooked factors in the development of a child that may lead to violence later in life (prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances for example) but they also reflect the mistaken perception that the answer to these troubled children, whom we as a society produce, is incarceration and criminalization.

"took the test on the 20th and: I really don't think I passed the nce and I took it yesterday in Harrisbug. The questions on the NCE were much more difficult and tricky than I could have ever imagined they would be. There was so much on the test about career counseling and statistics and the encyclopedia just did not seem to do those areas any justice. It's my own fault for not researching those subjects more than relying on the book but I assumed that the book had covered what I would need to know and I think I was wrong. In 6-8 weeks I will find out if I passed or not, and if I didn't, I will be purchasing the nce review that has been mentioned here by others. As soon as I looked at the first question and the way in which it was written, I knew I was not fully prepared.

Because I got 2 oranges, I did not get one of the colors I was supposed to get (""Pale Vermilion"").Also, one of my browns had NO LEAD it. It was HOLLOW. The verithins didn't come pre-sharpened, so I did not notice until I tried to sharpen it.Would not buy again. I thought about returning, but figured it wasn't worth paying the shipping cost.It's hard to find verithins that are sold individually, so I can't even replace the mistaken pencils.Be careful when buying.

"Interesting, but this is not an authentic diary: I defer to a previous reviewer who stated, ""This book was no more written by an 11-year-old than it was written by my Himalayan cat."" This book sounds like an adult desperately trying to sound 11. I also found the book lacking in any real or useful substance. It's more like a Juvenile Fiction book--interesting while reading it, but ultimately forgettable. In absolutely no WAY is this book as ""amazing as Wasted!"" (by Marya Hornbacher)!! For an infinitely better book than ""Stick Figure,"" I highly recommend ""Diary of an Anorexic Girl"" by Morgan Menzie. Really insightful, funny at times, and beautifully written.

"I have had nothing but problems with this printer: I have had this printer for about two years, and I am about to junk it.Here are some of the problems I've had:- Almost every time I turn on the printer the drivers re-install. Then my computer shows another printer selection available (Copy 1, Copy 2, etc). This has happened with two different HP computers.- If any one of the color ink cartridges is empty, the printer will refuse to print anything, even black only.- If any one of the ink cartridges is ""expired"" (still plenty of ink in it!) -- the printer refuses to print.- Yesterday I replaced all of the ink cartridges (one or more were ""expired"") to print some photos. All brand new original HP ink cartridges, and my printer is telling me that one of the cartridges must be replaced soon because the ink level is almost out of ink.- And now the printer says I am out of photo paper, although it is loaded with photo paper. Can't get it to print a photo.Bye-bye HP printer!

"all wet: If this were a fictional story, it would be a pretty good one. My problem with it is that it pretends to tell a young audience - yes, it is a juvenile book, though not so labeled - a multifaceted, deeply moving historical story of bravery and significance. But it does so with grossly misrepresented and/or invented characters, false ""facts,"" and pure historical invention. Once this nonsense enters the mind, it's difficult if not impossible to replace with the truth, which is far more interesting anyhow.

"Wish I would have known: My daughter opened the camera and it was a hit!! Then we tried it, still looked pretty good. She took it to school and had a great time. The bad thing is that we tried this 3 times. I took the camera to her soccer game thinking that maybe it was something she was doing. No such luck! The camera will not store pictures for very long, not even long enough to drive home. The software is terrible, no Bratz content what-so-ever. So much for the scrap booking idea! Don't buy it, and if you ever find a good kids 1st camera please rate it so I can get one. Very disappointing.

"Poor Film Making at Its Finest: Bloody awful. Character actions lack motivation, logic, or explanation. Acting is brilliantly mediocre. Dialogue, what little there is between flashbacks and dream sequences, lacks punch and believability. Plot--if it can be called that--is tedious. Scenes drag on and on. It's pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors' other film, ""Shank,"" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.

Everything about it is horrible - acting, editing, plot, special effects (if you could even call them that), etc etc.Because of that, however, it's become a favorite with my group of friends. I've shown it to just about everyone I know and we all find it hilarious, so I'm buying it for one of my friends as a birthday present. I don't know. I suppose it has it's own special place in our heart in a ""so-bad-it's-good"" kind of way.

"A Dissapointment: Those who have read biographies about Professor J.R.R. Tolkien would know that if he were living he would be absolutley abhorrent of this book. Tolkien was a very religious person, and his religion was Catholic, which is completely against tarot cards. This is the kind of thing that would make him turn-over in his grave. I'm sure that a lot of Tolkien fans would agree with me in saying that Tolkien Enterprises has stooped pretty low in using Tolkien tarrot cards. If Tolkein were alive and knew about this he would be greatly angered. So, please, to all you fans of Tolkien out there, and those who respect his ideas, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS COMPLETELY AGAINST WHAT TOLKIEN STOOD FOR! There are many other good Tolkien books so go check it out for yourself.

"Appalling Scholarship and Near-Plagiarism: Spear is a very good imitator (he paraphrases nearly an entire paragraph of Volume 2 of Needham!), but he's not very good at reading material. For some unknown reason he managed to swap the two main systems (Hetu and Luoshu) in his book, and NO ONE HAS BEEN THE WISER. Are you sure you want to trust your life and Feng Shui to someone who can't even get the basics straight?

"Disappointingly Superficial: As an amateur naval historian, I've always been fascinated by the bravery of that first takeoff of a fully loaded B-25 at a time when the US was at such a low point in its 20th century history. Despite the advice of my Navy colleagues (especially one who journeyed to China in an attempt to recreate Doolittle's travels in China) I bought this product thinking that the reviews justified the purchase. Anyone who would seek an in-depth history of that mission and the courageous men who made that extraordinary mission, and who is accustomed to the depth and detail of professional military historians will be disappointed at the number of questions unanswered. Otherwise, it's a nice 3-hour read.

"Panasonic DMR-ES10S DVD Recorder D.O.A.: The machine arrived rather loosely packed. I could never get it to display the setup menu on the TV, nor could I get it to simply play an existing DVD. I waited on hold for over an hour on Panasonic's tech support line and gave up waiting for someone to talk to me. I've returned the unit to Amazon.com. At least all I lost was the return shipping costs. Since remanufactured means something went wrong with it the first time, you'd think I would have known better. You really do get what you pay for...

"Thomas battery engines: fun until they break: We bought a pair of the metal, battery powered 'Thomas' trains and one stopped working almost immediately.Upon opening the case (required special triangle driver bits that we had to buy for $10) we discovered that a wire had come loose from the motor (factory solder job didnt hold). After getting all the necessary tools assembled (solder iron, solder, flux, etc) we repaired the motor.Trying to reassemble keeping the gears in place while replacing the body was very difficult. It worked great...for 30 min and now died again.My kids may drop the train from 1-2 ft high (they're 2 years old, so not any higher than 2 ft up), but a $30 metal clad toy should survive a 2 year old who isnt rough with it. I would NOT buy these again. It seemed like fun, but at $30 each + tools to repair...find your kids something else.

"A good snapshot of after you win...: Being a coach, and also a former state/national titleholder, I was hoping this book would give some more useful tips for young women who are just starting out in pageants. While the pictures and the story she tells about her journey through the USA system are very nicely done (and I would love to know where she got those rhinestone hoop earrings!), there was very little about wardrobe selection, entry forms, getting the right ""type"" of look for a pageant, etc as opposed to her experiences after she won. It's a good read and a nice addition to your pageant library if you have one like I do with over two dozen books, but if you are looking for hardcore pageant tips, stick with Ann Marie Bivan's ""100 secrets to winning beauty pageants"" or the hard to find out of print ""How to Win Pageants"" by Ginie Polo Sayles.

"Doesn't Heat Breastflow Bottles: I bought this warmer because I own the Breastflow bottles and I was thinking that since the two products are made by the same company, it should work.

"Block falls short: I wish that there were a way to give this book two different ratings. I find that Block is an excellent description writer, so if you are looking to add more color and light to your writing I would recommend reading and studying her work, because I'm sure it would help. However, Block falls short in creating a solid story, she does not establish things well, including the girls friendship, from which the entire novel is based. Throughout the novel you are hopping from place to place wondering how it got to this place and that. As I was looking at other reviews for her various books I noticed some similar to mine, and those that rated her highly were simply relating to or wanting to be like one of the characters. I found that this book lacked substance and unless you are a diehard Block fan I would not recommend getting it.

"Junk: This monitor is a complete piece of junk. I've used other monitors and this is so inferior, I am amazed that it is even on the market.- you have to apply ' moisture' to get the sensor pads working. And even if you moisten it and get it working, if it has a couple of minutes to dry off, you have to re-moisten it.- the fastener hardly works. You have to wrestle with it for it to stay on.Truly a pathetic product. Stay away.

"Lame: I am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.The acting was terrible, elements of the story were changed (I know, it can't be 100% true to the book, but this was a massacre), and the characters were ruined (c'mon, they made the movie version Mr. Tumnus seem just a tad bit...um...creepy). They turned Aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion.Seriously, go read the books and don't waste your time on this film.

"Unnecessarily long and bland: This book is not at all like the first one, which is very imaginative and interesting. It is very boring and felt it was unnecessarily elongated. It was too cliched and you can feel the author's fatigue all around. She does not need to make it this huge, if she can keep it precise and interesting.

"Fun reading but...: I'm trying to convince my teen-age nephew to spend the summer with me in California so I can teach him to fly. I was considering sending him a copy of FLIGHT OF PASSAGE along with a letter promising to let him make a flight like that if that's what he'd like. But as a flight instructor I just can't send him the book in good conscious. The kids in FLIGHT OF PASSAGE swear more than anyone I've ever met-and that's saying a lot! They spend the night drinking with a very disreputable type, fly hung over the next morning and run a Grayhound bus off the road in a game of chicken! Fun is fun and I sure don't think of myself as a prude but after twelve years as a professional pilot I know it's this sort of disregard for the rules that gets kids killed!

"Don't Get Hooked Up With Proactiv: I purchased the $29.95 trial pack from Proactive for my teen-aged son. Not only did it not work well, it took me nearly three months and dozens of phone calls to cancel my ""introductory"" offer. I finally had to lock them out of my PayPal account to keep them from taking more more money. I ended up paying $119.90 for two boxes of their product that does not work. I finally was able to cancel the account, but ended up paying over twice as much as they advertise for half the product. They are unethical and make it nearly impossible to cancel once they have your info. Avoid Proactiv as it doesn't work and they are crooks.

"A rose by the same name is not as sweet...: I recently bought this movie by accident, thinking it was the Rankin/Bass movie by the same name. I figured I might as well watch it anyway. It is awful. It makes very little sense. It drones on and on and is horribly boring. It has no story line to speak of. Even my 2 year old nephew didn't fancy it. There's a full 10 minutes of just sugar plums dancing. And they're wearing clothes. And it has Santa's reindeer practically starting an insurrection. This is nothing by comparison to the Rankin and Bass movie. So, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I am a Christmas movie fanatic. This is the first one ever that I didn't take to.

"Clunky and Mannered: First of all, Robert Olen Butler is an excellent writer, so when he undertakes a project you know there has to be some real potential in it.Unfortunately, ""Tabloid Dreams"" seems to be the exception. The gimmick here is that he has fashioned a dozen stories to explain a dozen tabloid headlines (real or made up? It doesn't really matter.) The problem is, with such outrageous premises, the stories do little more than expand on an already-ridiculous idea, and the reader is never fully ""vested"" in the story. There are some clever turns, and here-and-there he approaches the tenderness and compassion of his earlier short stories, but on the whole this collection falls flat with a resounding thud.Now that one of the stories (""Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover"") has been expanded into Butler's next novel (""Mr. Spaceman"") I'm revisiting ""Tabloid Dreams,"" but I'm afraid my opinion of it hasn't mellowed any since I first read it 4 years ago.

"Terrible range, terrible value: I wish I had been able to read the other reviews for this product prior to purchase because believe me, they're true. Unfortunately I bought it late one Sunday evening after my home phone broke suddenly. It was a total disappointment and I ended up replacing it after two miserable months. I can't imagine how it rates it's 5.8 Ghz since everything seems to cause interference. The phonebook allows you to appoint ringer selections to each entry, yet there is no correlation between what is in the phonebook and what comes up on the Caller ID. And the range... well, let's just say it might as well have a cord. Actually, it would be better with one, that way you wouldn't find yourself losing a call because you ""wandered"" 12 feet away from the base! I purchased mine for about $85 and still feel completely ripped off. I can honestly say that I NEVER had a satisfactory call on this unit. Steer clear of this one!

"A Catered Catastrophe: Cardboard, boring characters who do nothing but bicker constantly about nothing. Plot? Not in this book. Save your money. Buy something else, anything else. I think this is the first book in decades that I'll have given up on before finishing it!

"Monotonous: I usually like the family series, but these are somewhat predictable and jump to different scenes without warning. Being that this is a 21st century romance, it is somewhat lacking with respect to details in love scenes and sometimes character thoughts seem to make little sense. The series are written with realism, but shy away from the details where they really count in order to make the story balanced, stick and flow.

Anyway, someone want to buy a new game cheap? Better think twice even if you've got the newest hardware.I believe the positive reviews here were hammered out by the Rockstar team to insure they kept their now in question jobs!

"This DVD wins the Cynical Rip-Off Awards hands down!: Zodiac lovers beware! This bare-bones release (not bad in itself, mind you) only offers a few previews as extra features - okay, no big deal so far, but wait! The very first of those is none other than the preview... of the forthcoming 2-disc Extended Director's Cut loaded with extras, interviews, commentaries and tons of groovy stuff, to be relased next year. In other words, the first thing you get when you play this DVD is a very clear message that you have just been buying the wrong DVD. Now how's that for cynical?On second thoughts, one could argue that it's not really better to get that kind of information only several months later when the Extended Cut or Special Edition comes out with little advance notice - and you find you have to fork out(much)more money to buy the same movie yet once more...

"Half great, half not: When it comes to classical music recordings, I only have 2 absolutes-get the notes right and stay on pitch. Everything else is negotiable. Sadly, this recording has all too frequent occurances of the latter. Which is a great shame as Radu Lupu's piano work is outstanding, perfectly suited for Mozart. The violinist however, simply wasn't up to the task. There are very few instruments that shiver the spine when off-key like a violin. This collection has those moments in virtually every movement. It is one of the very few recordings I've ever heard where it's hard to figure why it was ever put on disc, or continued after the 1st day of recording for that matter. With so many other collections available, look elsewhere.

"Faithful Adaptation?: Yes this movie is certainly better than any other video game film ever made, but its really not that great anyway. I really wasnt expecting much though, so i wasnt surprised when they completely destroyed the plot and tried to explain everything to the dumb american audiences who can only understand sarcasm and irony, half of the time at that. Bottom line they took away what made silent hill so great, the unexplained, the surreal, and the atmosphere. But hey if you like movies like Saving Silverman and Donnie Darko than you'll no dought love this movie.

Also, Grant Lee Phillip's new solo albums have amazing stuff - I recommend you check those out first!

I have spent more than a week trying to back up to multiple disks (as described on p 37 of the pdf manual which came on my installation disk. I now gather that others have had the same problem. Elswhere manual appears to contradict itself: on p. 47 it says that ""you cannot clone a volume over a network, but on the following page it appears to tell you how to do so.But my main concern what appears to be non-existent support. There is evidently no telephone support. The Intego web site has provision for requesting on-line support.

"Save your money: The cover of this DVD made me think this would be a good action/fantasy movie. Wrong!! A third of the way through the movie I started laughing to myself. I began skipping my way through it to get it over with. Maybe I skipped the better parts, I don't know. The costumes looked like a school play and the wig on the princess was awful. Not to mention some of the actors were really bad at faking the english accent they used. And I've never seen a brighter yellow than the color of the little umpa lumpa/yoda wanna be with big sponge fingers. I wasted a perfectly good free redbox movie on this.

"Complicated-even for adults: My 3 1/2 year old son received this game for Christmas, so you can imagine how disappointed he was when we couldn't get it work. I tried it on two different DVD players which are not that old and neither one worked! When I tried to contact Fisher Price by phone, I got a recording saying they were very busy and to call back or go to the website they gave. I tried the website to no avail! Needless to say, I now have to take it back along with the 3 extra DVD's we purchased.You would think that they would make something that was not so complicated to set up. If I were you, I would research this product before purchasing it.It isn't an expensive investment but not worth the aggrivation and the disappointment of a toddler.

"Eh: Got what I paid for ($5) - you can't buy a decent pair of speakers for this low of a price.They sounded horribly poor when I hooked them up - the speakers literally hurt my ears with the highs, and not in a ""oh-so-loud"" way, but in a painfully screeching way. Perhaps mine were defective.And to make matters worse they, despite being a 3.5 inch speaker, did not fit into the 3.5 inch speaker holes in my wife's 1996 Dodge Neon. Not worth returning as I'd end up paying what I paid for them just to return them so they'll just take up space until I find a purpose for them.

"Lies My Teacher Told Me: Lies My Teacher Told me has interesting facts about history that many people did not learn in school. I found that most of the book was boring and seemed to repeat itself.

"Yeah, but where are the complete instructions and parts: I WAS HAD. The blurb mentions attachments (plural) Where are they? I got one!!! I called and was laughed at. Sort of a ""Sorry, sucker"" laugh. I wanted to know where the instructions were and got snickered at again. I guess that one page bit of nonsense with typos was all I was going to get. No explanation of how the automatic turn on off works. Called the manufacturer's distributor and got laughed at again.While this may be a fine piece of equipment (I gave up and gave it away) it is totally lacking in (1) the attachments that are needed to use it (oh, did I mention that for nearly $100 ""they"" will sell you an accessory kit. Yeah, right!) and (2) the user's manual is all but useless and there is no on line help that I could find.Save your money and buy one of the noisy but well equipped and instructed Craftsman marginal pieces of equipment.

"Weak orchestra: Well, I give the conductor points for trying, but this is not a blockbuster orchestra, nor an underrated one. It is mostly just weak, particularly in the brass, which sounded like they were offstage or something. Percussion and strings were very loud, the interpretation was alright, but nothing about this recording screamed ""Shostakovich"" at me. If there's one thing Shostakovich did well, it was making a symphony scream at you, and this one fails.

"Not a worthwhile purchase...look elsewhere: The words of Epictetus are sound advice and valuable to any seeker of knowledge. However, Sharon Lebell manages to make his words sound like fridge magnet philosophies more than reasoned tracts. In the brevity and condensation much is lost. Of the 113 pages (not 144 as stated) many are only third of a page (or less) 'soundbites'. It is more of a pamphlet than a book and not worth the cover price. Lebell adds nothing to the words of Epictetus and manages somehow to make his philosophies less potent. Fortunately, if she is truly a student of Stoic philosophy, my review shouldn't bother her in the least. For a fantastic look at the Stoic philosophy and it's modern application I suggestA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.

"Stopped working after 2 months: I thought this would be great with the colored readout, but it seemed like the battery was low from the first use. I only used it 3 times within the first week and when I went to use it a couple months later, the battery was dead. I took it back to the store and the manager let me get the same one to replace it. I was happy since this one seemed to have a stronger battery. I only used it about 4 times the day I purchased it. When I went to use it about 4 months later, it was dead. I assume the battery drains even when not in use. Other BD digital thermometers I have had in the past have lasted years, not weeks or months.

"A very poular series, but less then perfect ...: If you are looking for charming characters, but love a lack of storytelling, drawing ability, animation skill, or central planning...then THIS series is for YOU! Lina, the ultra sorceress of an alternate universe, slums around and attracts more fellow travellers then troubles. This first series is a single story in some ways, but gets confused and lost in minutia. Lina and company are great to watch, but the action sequnces and designs are less then thrilling, however the humor is quite good (the kissing fish episode was really memorable). The side kicks pile on as the creator decides he doesn't know what he wants to write about, or how to make decent character interaction with a minimal cast. I purchased these videos as they came out and thought of them as cheap comic books- view once and put in a closet for eternity. Entertaining, yes, but not engaging or skillful. This series is probably best appreciated by the pre-pubescent anime fan.

"The Glowing Reviews must have been written by relatives.: After forcing myself to finish this poor excuse for a novel - I have come to the conclusion that the glowing 5 star reviews written for this book must have been written by Mr. Sandford's relatives. This read like a reject script from a network tv crime show. Carmel Loan and Clara Rinker are not at all believable. Davenport's skills as a deputy are more a product of luck than skill. Amazing how everything turns up in no time at all. Just in time for the commercials. Whew! Since this is my first (and last) Sandford book - I can only speculate that he got the book deal based on his past journalistic accomplishments - not his literary skills. I will be a very cautious buyer next time I shop at Amazon and will not look to these reviews as a kind of guidence to buy the book. Can I get my money back?! djp@capgroup.com

"Nice GPS but the maps are kind of old: I got this in June and it has been really helpful; gives good directions. Some of the features you have to pay more to use, and they don't tell you that.The most annoying is that the maps are from last May and they won't be updated until November next year. So if you live or travel where there are new or changed roads, be prepared to watch your Nuvi show you are driving through the fields !! Also, the map updates will cost about $[...].

"Love the bottles, not the trainer...: My breastfed son LOVED the Dr. Brown's bottles and used them exclusively when I was at work. When it came time to try a trainer, we were excited to try the Dr. Brown's trainer. Unfortunately, it was not what we'd hoped. 1) It's HUGE, so a large amount of liquid must be placed inside. Otherwise baby/toddler will have to tilt his head at an extreme angle to get any liquid. 2) It's leaky. We've had lots of leak issues with this trainer. 3) If the valve isn't positioned just perfectly, the child sucks and gets nothing but air while the trainer leaks all over the place. 4) It's expensive! I really wanted to love this trainer, but in the end it didn't work out for us. We finally ended up using a Nuby silicone trainer at first so that my son got the idea of sucking on a soft trainer, then switched to Playtex sippy cups which are excellent! Sorry, Dr. Brown's...

He tried everything and in the end said that they cannot help me [if tech support cannot then who can???]. Now I have been asked to go to a T-Mobile store and they MAY be able to help me.When I ask to talk to a supervisor, I was transferred to a number which was playing the message ""The Number you have reached is incorrect"" ha ha ha how funny.Will never take T-mobile service ever.

"I just saw this today: Like I mentioned, I just saw this version. I have read the book many times and love the book. First thing, this version does not follow the bood very closely. Too many things were left out. There was not very much emotion portrayed in this version. There was much of it in the book and other versions I have seen. Jane was too pretty in the the movie. I couldn't imagine Jane being that pretty in the book. It tells me in the book that she was plain. Everything was sickly sweet and glossed over.

"what are they thinking?!: The first episode was impressive in a graphic, fleshy way, and the story seemed initially interesting.

There is actually nothing good about the script except that unfortunately there is a market for this.

"Caution, I was Glutened by MI-DEL Ginger Cookies: I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction. On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy. The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status. Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.

"Meh: I bought this for my son for Christmas because it was a great price and seemed like something he would really enjoy since he's into playdough. I couldn't have been more wrong. The packaging makes it look like you can mold all these amazing shapes with it. I guess if you spent hours upon hours you could make that happen...but a 4 year old won't stick around long enough for that (and neither would I). He's only played with the foam ONE time and has lost interest in it completely. It basically just ended up being a waste of money. I should have just bought more playdough.

The 5380-21 failed after approximately 50 holes in the hammer mode. The chuck stopped turning after less than an hour of use. I finished the job with a Hitachi drill costing less than half of the price. Milwaukee lost their legendary quality when they moved their manufacturing facilities to China. I am so disappointed. I will not buy Milwaukee again.

"Not for me: I got this epilator almost 2 years ago, and I use it every so often to see if it'll magically work for me. Two years later, still no luck. I got it to use on my legs and I was so disappointed with the results. I followed the instructions exactly, but it still only broke the hairs instead of removing it completely from the root (I can tell because I can't see the rounded root of the hair it ripped out). I wasn't left with smooth results at all, even after doing it several days in a row. It really is painful, but you're ripping hair out, so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating. I just couldn't get this to work for me. It's a shame because it was extremely expensive.By the way, if anybody has any tips in case I'm somehow doing this wrong, please respond to this review. Again, this was really expensive and I hate to waste money.

"GREAT show, LOUSY DVD set: As other reviewers here have already stated, all the shows on this DVD set are the syndicated edited versions.

"Double workprint: 1* is rating this as an Item recieved not the quality or content of the Movie!This was bought as a gift for my husband who is a big fan of the film so should have been the perfect gift. The main issue was the double copy of the work print as many others have said in review but as we are UK resident replacing the disk is taking time though Warners in the UK say they are sorting this out for him. There where also issue with poor packing of the item resulting in a broken case but obviously thats an issue to be sorted out with Amazon. He has yet to see the final cut but has watched all the alternate versions and no doubt when he gets a copy of the final cut he will be on cloud 9, as so many say the blu ray Final cut is stunning. Till then he says he will ""dream of electric sheep"" and hopes no one finds him out !

"Thoughts of a new ""pledge"": Unlike some poor reviews, I actually read this book.Unsurprisingly, as a new sorority sister I frown upon it. Not just upon Robbins' clearly bias reports from disgruntled greek women, but of her intentions in writing the book.It is entirely unethical for Robbins to publish private sorority secrets; that is a mark against feminism itself. The secrets represent the foundations of centuries of female bonding and empowerment.I applaud Robbins for opening a nationwide discussion on such unsightly topics as rape and drug use within the greek community, but it is not a balanced one. There is an upside for every downside, and usually a bright one. I have spoken with dozens of greek women who credit their house as the reason they stayed in college rather than fall into a lazy dorm routine and drop out.I recommend that women considering rushing greek life speak with women who have been in the system RATHER than read this book as their source of information.

"Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Helleni: Although this book contains much interesting information on the hellenistic age, I think it has several flaws. First, it contains too many subjective opinions to be properly 'scientific'. Second, Green's sarcasms are often so biting and his views so negative, that it is likely to kill the lay persons' fascination for the subject. Furthermore, his views on art and architecture is often at variance with most authorities. A case in point is the Laocoon, which in Green's opinion is a dreary piece of art. Great artists such as Michelangelo and Rubens clearly did not share this view. I am not saying that it is not allowed to share a few personal opinions in such a vast book, but in this case it clearly diminishes the value of the text for both the professional historian and the lay person.

"A different read: This book by Carl Rollyson shows a tremendous amount of work in preparation and writing. The book to me, is a little confusing because it goes back and forth in time as it discusses various elements of Mailer's life. Mailer apparently is a very complex person, though a very gifted writer who has worked hard to present his craft to the public. There are so many aspects to the book and to Mailer's life that it was a little difficult for me to read and follow. There is a solid amount of work in the book so many will enjoy it. I took several days to think about how to handle this review because of the above difficulties for me.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Ways"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms""

"Seemed great until we used it and saw what else was out there...: The first few times we went out to smaller stores with tiny carts, it seemed great. The we went to the grocery store: it's so small it won't stretch over the entire seating area to fasten on the handle. It doesn't cover the sides of most grocery store carts either, so my son was chewing on every exposed surface, defeating the purpose of the stupid thing. The pillows are a nice touch, but overall the cover is thin and uncomfortable and baby can't lie down comfortably (or at all) with this one. We are getting a BuggyBaby cover to replace this useless thing. The verdict? Cute but don't bother unless you only shop at very tiny stores with very tiny carts.

"5 out of 5 for the music.....as for the production: For any collector of music,a majority of CD reissues are faithful(or can even enhance)the original production. Alas, with Tres Hombres (in my opinion ZZ Top's finest album, and a rock classic to boot), the drums have been remixed with something similar totheir 80's offerings. (Which are fine by the way, but do not belong here) It has ruined the sound and overlooked some of the excellent musicianship on the original recordings. The same applies to the album `Tejas' I would ignore this issue till Warner Bros decide to reissue early ZZ Top with respectful and decent remastering, such as that shown in the `Chrome, Smoke and BBQ' boxset and `Rancho Texicano' (Very Best Of), where Engineer and remastering expert Bob Ludwig has done a faithful and exceptional job. As for now, those with fond memories of ZZ Top on the vinyl versions, will be in for a nasty shock.

"Ack.: I am a haole (caucasian from the mainland) who loves ticky tacky-type luau music (the kind performed for tourists), as well as exotica (the music that wafted from my parents' vinyl albums when I was a baby in the 60's). But honestly, this album falls short of both of those categories.It is truly awful. It sounds like Lawrence Welk's sickly rendition of ""Polynesian"" music. Just listen to the first sample, and you'll detect the distinct sound of an old guy waving a baton at his orchestra. Yeesh.There are many, many great CD's out there to help provide the perfect ambiance and background for your next luau or cocktail party. This one, however, ain't it. Keep shopping!

"Lost cause: Losing it? Petty's totally lost it ... at least on this lazy slab of retro-rough drafts. Since ""Full Moon Fever,"" Petty's somehow picked up a reputation as a ""master songwriter."" He may have had a way with a hook way back when, but a ""master"" would certainly take more care with the melodies and show more invention with rock's cliches. Many of the songs attempt Petty's by now painfully familiar 'folk' feel -- which means they drone on and on without getting any place. Even the one track he should ace -- the garage-y ""Free Girl"" -- is more volume than actual hooks. Comparing this to ""Hard Promises"" or ""Damn the ..."" will bring tears to your eyes.

"Music overpowered Dialogue at the ending.: It was a fantastic movie for Batman, the Joker and the D.A., and Batman's ill-fated fan-girlfriend. However, either the theater employees turned up the volume on the music, or the music track played way too loud so that the dialogue could not be heard. What was said at the end of the movie was lost in the loud music. The loud music ruined hearing the last words. I hope that the last dialogue of the DVD is not spoiled like it was in the theater. (Repetition for emphasis) I may rent The Dark Knight first, before I buy it, to make sure that the dialogue is not overpowered by the music score.

"returning this carseat ASAP: This car seat took my husband over on hour to install and once it was in, we couldn't reach the latch to loosen the shoulder straps. Once the baby was in the seat, it was very difficult to pull the strap-it did not pull easily, it was more of a ratcheting motion where I had to pull and release, pull and release over and over. If that wasn't enough, only one side of the shoulder strap would tighten and the other side was totally loose! I took the seat completely out to try and figure out this problem, but to no avail. I will be returning it as soon as I can and splurge for the more expensive but easier to use car seat.

"Whither Star Trek?: When watching this film at the theater I almost walked out. It really seamed not to be a Star Trek film and certainly not one of the Star Trek The Next Generation films. Something there is missing, the now classic characters seemed bored and very boring. As with Generations I didn't care for the lighting which gives the Federation ship a very dark look. The film was promotted as the film with the vilian as good as Kahn, should be because he was a carbon copy. When are they going to just release a good story that doesn't have a vilian?

"Not so good.: I liked Tom Clancy's early books, _Red Storm Rising_, _Sum of all Fears_, etc. However, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was interesting in places, but too formulaic. He tends to get lost when not speaking techno-babble - the character development is poor, there isn't alot of tension, etc. And long...way too long. It could use some serious editing. Has anybody else noticed how Clancy has started using the same phrases repeatedly in his books? For example, two or three novels ago he started using the phrase ""been there, done that"". Not just once, but many times per book. Rainbow Six has 3-4 ""been there, done that""s in it, several comparisons of the men on Rainbow 6 to ""lions"", that sort of thing. It is as though Clancy is writing each scene in his story outline, then just glueing them together. He needs an editor. Also, this book could have been written by Rush Limbaugh. Yeah, vegetarians are a pretty serious danger to the world.

"The Magical Approach: Seth Speaks About the Art of Creative Living: If you're looking for LOA material, this book is very dense, difficult to read. Not nearly as smooth and streamlined as Abraham-Hicks materials. Much of it has more to do with Jane Roberts and her husband's personal lives and artwork, than it does with LOA. I was disappointed.

"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!: I can't complain about the shipping as this arrived ahead of time. I was also excited to see that there was the UltraViolet digital copy. However when going to redeem the digital copy I was advised that the redemption code had already been used. When talking to the digital copy company they advised the season is more likely counterfeit. Upon further review I notice that 4 out of the 6 disc's have huge scratches on them!!! They will not even attempt to play!!! I am now going to have to spend more money to get good discs that will actually play!!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!! The season cannot be labeled as new and have scratches on the discs like it has been open. NEVER WILL I BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!!!!

She lives in Brazil, so I was there and finaly could give her perfums.Unfortunately she was not happy with the perfums, because they don't have the same smell and she thinks they are not original because they don't smell the same as the other one she already has. I am very disappointed with this purchase.

"burnded up under a heavy load: I have used this tool about 3 or 4 minutes for a couple sanding jobs in the last few months...I needed to hog out a 1 inch hole in some ABS plastic...I had a dremel round flap sander that fit so I tired it...i had to crank up the speed pretty high due to the load but it was sanding it ok...after a minute or so I smelled a hot electrical smell and then right away saw a quick puff of smoke out of the motor vents and it stopped working...i guess I could understand it burning up if I had been using it in this usage if I had been doing this for 5 or 10 staight minutes but that was not the case...I guess I will try the warranty and if I get a new one baby it...

"Just not for me: This book arrived about 2 weeks ago, and i really did think i could read it. Having been a bad girl who is now saved by grace, and having learned many things the hard way, i thought that i could learn a few lessons from those who have gone before me. Well, i tried to read it, but honestly, this book is not for me.Just recently i shared with a friend why my family won't be attending the really big Easter production in our city...i am very careful about the graphic images that we take in. And the written images in this book are ones that i simply don't need. This may be a useful tool for others, but not for me. While the Bible certainly does mention scandalous behaviors and women, most of the Bible isn't written in an alluringly graphic way.So, this is my honest non review, of a book that was sent to me by the publisher. There are many other much more thorough reviews of this book, if you are interested, you can read some of them here.

"Founding church offers a review of ""Prep"": While many parents insist that ""Preparation for Parenting"" is as Biblical as it purports to be, the church where it all began does not allow it to be taught there any longer, in part due to theological problems and a lack of Biblical support for the infant management advice, such as schedule feeding, avoiding the use of slings, etc. For a brief statement of their major concerns, please visit http://www.fix.net/~rprewett/grace-ezzo.html

"Worthless trash: The item arrived fine and intact, but upon opening the box I found myself staring at what I can only assume is someone's sick and twisted joke. I spent 45 minutes trying to ""assemble"" the rack, with the side pegs falling out on me every time I tried to put another piece in place. I finally got down to the bottom and the last side and noticed the piece meant for the bottom is curved in a way that makes it impossible to put in place. I'd attempt to bend it straight but it seems about as brittle as dead tree bark. I finally just figured with a bottom that brittle it would be all of a week before it was broken anyway and threw it in the trash, which is where it belongs I feel.

"RM-1 Impossible to Change Battery without Ruining It: Aside from complaints about short range, in trying to put a new battery in, carefully, I somehow managed to damage one of the battery contacts, bending it downward in such a way as to make it impossible to reinsert a battery inside the small plastic transport. The tolerances are so tight inside that it could not accommodate the new battery inside the transport after the battery contact was bent downward. Because the slot for the plastic transport is less than 1/16 of an inch, there is enough room to insert a tool to bend the contact back upwards, but not enough room inside to actually bend the contact itself. One attempted battery change, and it was ruined. I'm looking for a non-OEM compatible now. Won't buy this junker again. First disappointment with Olympus after an e-500 and an upgrade to the e-510. Olympus shouldn't neglect these little products, but they did with this one.

"Proofreading problems galore!: I used this textbook during an intensive course. I think it was chosen for political reasons (the author's reputation or connection). But I found it to be lacking in many ways. First of all it is FULL of typos. In fact, one whole chart was mislabeled. An unsuspecting student might think they were learning the past plain form of the adjective when in fact, they were looking at the polite form. I was very frustrated by the typos. Secondly, I could never find clear grammar explanations. A grammar point would be introduced but there would only be one or two examples of it. Then another grammar point would be thrown in, all mixed together in the examples. I ended up buying a dictionary of grammar, which the teacher recommended when she realized how frustrated some of us were with this book.

"Consistency Problem: I ordered two sets of these lights from Amazon and two from another major retailer. The sets were totally different as far as light they put out. The solar collector fronts looked different. One looked sleek, the other like I put it together in my garage. One set put out acceptable light and I was very happy. The second set no where near the light. The inside lamp reflectors didn't even look the same. If this company is going to have such obvious inconsistencies in outsourcing and manufacturing their product, why not let me know - hey Bob, it's hit or miss! Now I have to pack them up, ship them back. A hassle - and a bad name for solar. A waste of my time overall and takes the mystery out of the good and bad reviews here.

"Lost in Translation: My husband and I love Reno 911 the TV series, so when the movie came out, we made sure we were in the theaters opening weekend. I have to say the movie was a big disappointment for us. The same humor was there as in the TV screen, but it just didn't translate onto the big screen. Maybe inserting a plot into Reno 911's random off-the-wall humor slowed it down too much.

"small spoilers: I just needed to add my vote to the ""very disappointed"" list.It wasn't a bad thing that Ms. Cromwell switched to a narrative point of view, but the 1- to 2-page chapters were very disjointed, taking up a lot of space in the novel without giving bulk to the storyline.The characters had all lost their character. (I MISSED Marino's ""Yo!"") No one talked the way we've become accustomed to them talking.The climactic ending was anything but climactic. Did Ms. Cromwell get bored with her own novel at the very end? We weren't even allowed to ""witness"" what should have been a very satisfying end to the serial killer, we're just told that he's dead and we have to be satisfied with that.I will definitely wait until I read the reviews of the next Kay Scarpetta novel, because even the ""cliffhanger"" isn't enough to drive me to the book store.

"Precious and sleep-inducing: Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Kate Rusby's voice and solo recordings. But boy oh boy, this one puts me to sleep. Of course the singing is beautiful, but it doesn't have any of the energy that Rusby's solo cds have. That energy is particularly important with music that can easily sound like precious museum pieces. Buy Rusby's other stuff; it's all wonderful.

"Painfully Useless: Another reviewer called this book a brain-dump and I can't possibly top that for visual effect or appropriateness when describing this useless book. I learned nothing that I didn't already know about trading and was subjected to painful stories about his boring family. The tone of the book is insufferably haughty, snobbish and condescending. He talks about how great he is in one sentence, followed by a declaration of his humility in the next. If you want to know where Niederhoffer's parents played handball during the winter, this book is for you. If you are looking for a real book about trading, buy Market Wizards.

Even his father would have been better! He was BORING. and what was with all the plots left hanging? mainly the one involving Sara and Jess. i believe the last we hear of them is when she slams the door in his face, then nothing. i have to admit, i think i'd have rather read their story than Sloan's. the only reason i gave this book 2 stars was because of the beginning, before Sloan left to meet her father and sister. that part i honestly enjoyed, but after that, i just could not continue reading.

"Lame: The story of 4 astronauts who get caught in a solar storm and survive, but with their DNA severely altered. They develop superpowers and become the Fantastic Four. I didn't read the comic books so I don't care how it stacks up to them. The movie taken by itself is pretty bad. There is very little set-up to explain who everyone is and what exactly they're doing in space. In fact, throughout the entire movie there is little character development. The only person who actually acts in the film is Michael Chiklis as The Thing. Everyone else give awful performances, especially Jessica Alba. They're not helped by the atrocious dialog they have to say. The script must have taken about 20 minutes to write. I gave it 2 stars because I've seen worse movies and there are a few good effects sequences, especially at the end.

"Below average saw: I bought this saw because I thought the price was right, and I thought I wouldn't need a high-end saw for the light work I would be doing. First off, the saw vibrates enough to loosen your teeth. For the life of me, I cannot keep this thing cutting in a straight line. The quick-clamp is pretty nice, and so is the scrolling feature for tight turns (unfortunately, you need it for straight line cuts too). The line of sight is not bad, either. Overall, a below average jig-saw.A neighbor of mine has a Bosch Barrel-Grip he swears by, so I'll check one of those out. Pass this one up.

"Causes Insomnia, should probably avoid.: I took 6 pills for two days, and was unable to fall asleep as a result of these vitamins. A co-worker recommended these to me, and when he increased his dose to about the same, he also had trouble sleeping. It probably causes the adrenaline levels to increase and keeps the mind active, even if the body is very tired. There is no denying that the vitamins are effective, however, its the wrong kind of effectiveness if you ask me.

"Beware of this title.: I rented this recently thinking I was going to see a film from my childhood called Helter Skelter. I wasn't even allowed to watch it when it was on but years later saw it on very late night T.V. It was a two-parter which started with the murders and concentrated on the trial which was more of a circus than O.J.'s ever could have been. Now to get back to this particular film. It is not the movie I am thinking of. It is too weird for words. This had barely any dialogue for over an hour, poorly shot and it took forever to find any info on it. Apparently this was some student film made in 1971 or 72' after the trial was completed. I felt compelled to write this so no one buys this by mistake. The real movie was based on the excellent book by Vincent Bugliosi which was very researched and lived through by the author.

"Lame and irritating: I bought this game based on the positive reviews, but I'm not sure I'm playing the same game as the other reviewers. The dialog is lame, annoying, and repetitive, not funny.

"Another magnet for backslidders: I have been a part of the oneness movement for over twenty five years, and a statement like "" Christianity Without the Cross "" could not be further from the truth. Acts 2:38 salvation as taught in the Bible as everything to do with the Cross of Jesus Christ, His burial and His resurrection. Those ""former"", oneness preachers know full well, that works are the fruit of a Spirit filled life and not a means to an end. Jesus Himself said by your fruits you shall know them.I can not tell you how many sermons I have heard on the Cross, the Blood of Calvary, the Grace of God. Pentecostalism is more than speaking in tongues, it embraces the entire work of the Calvary manifested in the life of believers today.Their are plenty of backsliders, disgraced preachers and reprobates who have a axe to grind, but trust me, the United Pentecostal Church is not another gospel, nor does it preach another Jesus. We teach and preach the Whole Gospel to the Whole World

"Fallacious, Sensationalized, Exaggerated...: It is clear that Robbins formulated her conclusions before beginning her ""research."" Her ability to tell the truth is severely hampered by her desire to sell books, and the sensationalized story that results is one that makes for great drama, but is a far from accurate depiction of reality. She stultifies the Greek system by seeking merely to perpetuate a stereotype of licentious behavior. In a nationwide Greek system, one can undoubtedly find any sought after ""truth."" The fallacy in Robbins' conclusion is that she applies such ""truths"" to the entire system. The nationwide Greek system is much larger, and more diverse, than the small sample she chose to experience. This ""exposé"" reveals two truths: Robbins lacks objectivity and serious fact-finding ability.

"Not as funny as it reads, but still cute: As a bit of schlock art, this wins, but it isn't as funny in execution as it reads on paper. Much of it doesn't exactly leap off the disc because some of these renditions take themselves too seriously. A switch of some of the artists to more known or displaced artists would have made this a cool in a I-still-carry-a-lunchbox-to-work kind of way: Roy Clark doing ""What A Wonderful World"" doesn't push out of the paradigm of the in-joke very much, but somebody like Alice Cooper playing it might have.Not that there aren't some jewels here: Devo's ""Ohio"" is a great cover AND a great song, and Don Ho doing Peter Gabriel's ""Shock the Monkey"" fits so perfectly in with what I was expecting out of this record that I can't understand why the executive producer (Cevin Soling) didn't pursue this type of miscasting thorughout.A good idea that doesn't quite live up to the potential of its own shlockiness. Quit being so serious and have more fun with it next time around.

"Not worth the time - worst movie ever seen: I saw this movie when it first came out in the early/mid 80's. It is by far the worst movie I've ever seen and the only reason I watched it to the end was to see how much more ridiculous the story line would get. Basically, the movie depicts a man who goes on a hunt in his house trying to catch and kill a rat, and in the process the man destroys his house. My husband and I were talking about the worst movies we'd ever seen and I told him about this one bringing him to Amazon's site to show him. I've no clue how this incredibly bad move could have a 4 star review. Don't waste your time on this one.

I HATE the new wings - there's nothing new about them - they are the same old, ineffective sticky-tabs that don't stay put. While I don't fault Amazon for sending me what they had in stock, I'm disappointed that they advertised this product as the Kotex with Velcro Wings!

"Not Reality: Like other reviewers, the author had resources to fall back on and she knew it was temporary and could quit at anytime. I was disappointed in this book mainly because I thought it would be more about stories of the people she met while working in minimum wage jobs. It was mostly about her and what she had to do to make ends meets, etc. I would have liked to read about REAL people who do this day in and day out with no end in sight. How do they manage to get up and do it all over again each day, knowing they'll never get ahead, never get a promotion, never make a decent living? I could never quite get into the author's shoes or feel any sympathy for her knowing she was playing a role and ""pretending"" to live like the other half. This is a good idea for a book, but needed to be written from the perspective of the low-wage workers...like interviews with them? How they perceive their jobs, how the future looks to them, how THEY manage to stay afloat?

"Not a Hero: If you like breaking people's limbs for fun, then Gotch was a hero. Yes he was good. He was also a brutal, petty, cheat who fixed matches against wrestlers he could have beaten anyhow. Please don't make a movie out of this subject.

"Not good: I got this for Christmas and was excited! When loading it onto my computer it asked for a serial number. I looked everywhere and there was no serial number. So I got on-line to talk to Tech Support. They said the product was six years old and there was no serial numbers for it. So my mom spent $15 on this product for nothing. We can't use it. To make it worse! The tech support guy gave me a serial number to try and he infected my computer with a virus. Needless to say it was a waste of money. I got a Label maker, ten blank cd's, and a CD album. NOT Worth the money.

"If you want to enjoy the novel more,: don't finish it. just skip the last 20 or 30 pages. i was loving it and ready to recommend it to family and friends... that is until i finished it. actually, it's not necessarily the ending that's so bad, just skip the part where susie jumps into ruth's body. that whole scene ruined what was otherwise a moving, and what could have been a healing, novel.

"Wait for a remaster: The master used for this copy is pretty bad, and it can not be from an original print. If you don't believe me, just check out the MMT footage used in 'The Beatles Anthology'(it's fantastic!). Apple must have access to the master, so my advice is to wait until they decide to issue this one themselves, maybe with bonus footage (are you listening, Apple...?)

"Great High School Effort!!: I just don't understand these other reviews. This record is terrible. Worst of all, it's boring. There's nothing here you wouldn't find at any local high school during a Battle of the Bands showdown. The vocals sound like Scott Weiland making love to John Popper, painfully. The playing is dull and uninventive. The songwriting much more of the same. Overall, you'd be better off using this disc as a coaster.

"Filler & not Widescreen: First off, this is a filler arc that isn't worth buying seeing how it does not even slightly contribute tot he over all story like the Bount arc. Also, this set is not in widescreen. These episodes originally aired in 16:9 in japan and were cut down to 4:3 for Adult Swim. When the box said uncut and orignal, they must be referring to the Adult Swim tv releases and not the actual orignal episodes.In addition to all that, there's nothing special to the box, not even a cardboard sleeve.

"a bit week in the seems: though the price was certainly right for these gloves, they promptly split at the seems during the 2nd or 3rd training session. A little duck tape allowed me to continue using them, but from now on I will spend a little more money and get a better glove. My trainer told me to get genuine leather and I am wishing that I would have taken his advice.

"DON'T BUY IT!: I should not have ignored all the poor reviews I found on several sites about the variable speed control on this drill press. I figured they had tried to adjust it when it wasn't running. I took delivery on this drill press yesterday. The very first time I turned it on and, SLOWLY AND GENTLY, tried to adjust the spindle speed. IT BROKE! When I opened it up, the belt had jumped the pulleys; it appeared as though the adjustable speed mechanism tore itself apart. I'll check into getting it fixed, but not sure I even want to keep it. That may depend on what the service people tell me about this piece of junk. At this point, though, it's a very heavy paper weight and definitely not worth wasting your time or money. This experience has SERIOUSLY damaged my opinion of the Delta brand.

"Lasted a year and a half...maybe: Here I am, after a year and a half looking for a new microwave to replace this one. It was awesome in the beginning. It warmed up food in no time at all. I didn't read the dimensions and it is really big-which I never liked, but boy was it fast. The past couple of months it started to take longer to warm food-a few seconds every couple of weeks. Last night I made popcorn, my husband then tried to warm water and the door just stopped closing. Now it's going to the dump where we have to pay $15 to get rid of it. By the way, the door latch is really loud to open and close. It has woken our kids up who are on a different floor of the house. In the middle of the night warming bottles I always winced in fear it was going to wake up the older toddler. No fun there when it happened.I guess you get what you pay for.

"Nice form - but definitely not great at any one thing.: I had to double check the label as I was under the impression that this camera was an HD (720p) camera. Well I guess there are no requirements or guidelines for marketing a camera as HD. The first thing I did when I received this camera was shoot some HD footage and then watch it on my HD tv. Boy - was I surprised. The footage looked awful. To be honest I have seen regular cameras and even cell phones that could give the video feature a run for it money.The standard photos looked pretty good, but shutter lag was a pain. The only reason I rated this camera a 2 is that the form factor was great and it is a good idea. Needless to say this camera was returned the very next day.

The previous edition worked fine, this one endlessly freezes up my computer, I have problems using the Mozilla browser, the list goes on and on.

Cracks keep appearing in the handles or part where the brush is screwed on. Sonicare has replaced them but tell me that they will no longer do this because I use baking soda or peroxide toothpaste. They claim paste with these ingredients cause the material to crack. You might want to be aware of this before purchasing.

"Passe: Have you ever come across a movie that you loved in your youth and watched it again, only to find out that what you had enjoyed so much had become trite? This is what I thought of this book, so much so that I put it down (which I have done less than 10 times in my life. The narrative is stilted and maybe it is an American vs Brit thing but I also felt it was amateurish.Don't get me wrong, I have read may Archer novels and loved ""As the Crow Flies"" which I read several times and recommended to family. But I kept thinking about the believably and boneheadedness of the dialogue and realized I just didn't care. At All.

"A Disaster: One For the Money should be a case study in how not to adapt a successful book series for the big screen. From the bad casting of Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum to the poorly written script to the flat direction, this film was horrible. Who in their right mind thought Heigl was a good choice at Stephanie? As for the rest of the cast, Jason O'Mara is a very good actor but so wrong for the part Joe Morelli. Daniel Sunjata was an OK Ranger, but really didn't inhabit the part. The only good casting was Rex the Hamster.One can only hope Janet Evanovich got the rights back.

"Not as good as the first Ghostrider: I didn't like this one, the filming looked really cheap, like a second-hand C-rated movie. The first Ghostrider had enough action to showcase Ghostrider, but in this movie, it just wasn't the same. This movie didn't seem as menacing, and kind of tame, with weak flames. I didn't like it at all.

"Strange and Disturbing: I went through this book from front to back and I am amazed that this is seriously being sold at major bookstores in this country. It is in my opinion the equivelent of the Taliban for the Christian religion for teens. I found it to be sexist and demeaning to women. Girls are being advised to be quiet, cover up, that they are sinners with sinful thoughts. The boys version does not seem to have the same harsh moral standards and judgement, merely requesting them to act like gentlemen. This is supposedly the new testiment, yet it has 2 versions, telling 2 different stories, the male version and the female version. I think you can find ""gods"" version in the religious studies section within the bible!

Anyone who describes this film as ""moving"" obviously lacks any intelligence.

"A continued denial of peer-reviewed, scientific research: Sullum attempts to ""demolish"" the argument that second-hand smoke is dangerous. Unfortunately, he must have been too lazy to take a ten minute look at medline and the abstracts from over twenty papers that have been published over the past five years explicitly showing that second-hand smoke increases tumor prevalence 2-3 fold in mice, drastically increases asthma in children of smokers, increases the risk of stroke to non-smokers by as much as 80%, etc. I am a libertarian on almost every issue myself, but I draw the line on issues where one free individual's actions directly harm another free individual, whether that be with a gun, a baseball bat, or a lit cigarette.

"Read better books: Wrong. Sounding strangely like a Y2K book, Bright predicts a coming world wide revival by 2000 (like many of the late 80s and 90s), they sell books, but lose credibility as anyone can look back and see that this book was a false prediction. Maybe if we brought back the Mosaic law which required the stoning of false prophets (Deut 18:20) people would make less of them. It must of also been long periods of going without food that led Bright to come up with the ""carnal Christian"" heresy. Bill Bright was one of many who led multitudes of college students (Campus Crusade for Christ)to accept Jesus as Savior and made Lordship optional.

"What was that?: Just finished watching Where the Wild Things are on DVD and I didn't get it at all. My kids 5 & 9 lasted for about 15 minutes and they bailed to go play in their rooms. I stuck it out since I paid for the movie. They seemed to be trying to get some kind of a message across, trying to make a connection with something abstract in the kid's phyche, but I didn't get it, my kids didn't get it and none of us could detect any plot. Late in the movie his beast friends get a little violent and one eats him. She does cough him back up, but a bit disturbing.

"Too much gravy and don't like the bones.: I did not realize that this actually had the bones in it. Not something that I would give to any dog let alone a Yorkie and a Poodle. The bones take up a lot of room in the can. The rest of the can contains little cubes of meat, a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy. I usually split half a can between the two dogs. The only way I am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables. The dogs really like it but I will not buy this flavor again. You are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy. I would recommend the Turducken. They absolutely love that one.

"A Worthless Piece Of Crap: I studied this worthless piece of crap for a whole month before taking the Praxis 0041 and did not come close to passing.

It DID, though, have about 60 questions on authors not mentioned in this waste of a good tree.

"If you want to become a shoe-maker, this is the crock-pot for you!: Seriously. I got this as a Christmas gift from my husband and it cooked my 3 lb. roast to super well-done in 3 hours on the lowest setting. Tried it again with pork chops thinking that I did something wrong. Same thing. Exchanged it for another one thinking we got a defective pot. Put a BEAUTIFUL 4 lb. roast in this piece of bowel movement, covered with all the best seasonings, expecting it to turn out wonderfully. Nope, it was done to shoe-leather quality in about 2.5 hours on the lowest setting. I took the temperature of it and it was 205 F. I'm livid. I've wasted SO much money on meals on this stupid ass pot and if I wasn't so set on returning it for my money back I'd take it out back and run over it a few times before blowing it up with dynamite.

"Mouse aggravation: I like the keyboard well enough, though having the caps lock light on the receiver rather than on the keyboard itself is silly. The ""F lock"" thing was very frustrating to figure out. But I have no real issue with the keyboard.The mouse is another story. The mouse generally does not function at all if it is more than two inches away from the receiver. Seriously, two inches. It really defeats the point of having a wireless mouse. My last wireless mouse was from Dell and I kept the receiver three feet away from the mouse with no issues whatsoever, so this new mouse is very frustrating. Weirdly, I can take the keyboard halfway across the room and it still works. The mouse also goes through batteries at an amazing rate.

"disappointing: After reading the reviews for this book, I was expecting a Renaissance experience. No such luck. The character development was poor. The dialogue was every bit as bad, if not worse. And the plot? What plot? The book had much potential, but the author treated it much too casually, often violating the solemnity of the material with his tortuous lightness. The ""French plantation"" episode was poorly conceived and very unconvincing. The concept of this novel is one that could make it a classic, but due to the aforementioned, I am forced to give it a low rating.

"Not for the casual scientist/sci fi reader: Asimov's collection of essays reprinted from various publications touches on topics such as chemistry, physics, electronics and astronomy as well as the philosophy of humanity's usage and development of these sciences. I have to admit that I didn't read them all in their entirety, but rather started them and read until I got bored or my head hurt to much. I am not personally well-versed in any of these areas, and so learned quite a bit. However, the information is rather dated especially in electronics and other technology. This is mostly a collection for the die-hard fan of Asimov, or some of his more scientifically educated fans. I'm pretty sure I thought it was science fiction when I picked it up, probably without even reading the back.

"Photo Studio: If it were not for the legs of the lights I would say it is a fairly nice product. Now, after much thought, I have come to the conclusion that someone must have paid a lot of money to an engineer to come up with an extremely poor design. The legs on one of my lamps failed to work the first time out. The second one the third time. I am in the process of undesigning the engineers design and make it work, but truthfully, it shouldn't be like that. This product was probably made in China.

I really don't want to know the square footage of the rooms. I'm sure the info is factual, but for some reason, there's so much of it to wade through, and much of the details were extraneous to me. The Birnbaum book cuts to the chase - easier reading and more practical advice. Buy the Birnbaum book, not this one, unless you are obsessed with details. I just want to go and have fun, the easiest way. This book was more complicated than estate planning!

"Hagee is a heretic: How do you make a career preaching about the end of the world? We've been in the ""end times"" since the death of Christ. Hagee has been using fear and emotion to take advantage and brainwash people for such a long time it's crazy, any Christian with an average knowledge of the bible can see that Hagee has indeed made up his own gospel. To all my fellow Christians, stop reading and buying into this end of the world hype, concentrate on your own spiritual growth, and witness to others. Don't be so quick to hate Muslims either.

"A Big Disappointment: I was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls I regularly use plus my fan and light controls. However, the Harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment. I was much better off with the 3 remotes I was using before. It was much simpler than fooling with the Harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions. I never have been able to get the Harmony to control the fan and lights.Some reviewers have said that you just need to take time to do the programming properly. Even if you do, in my case it's just easier to juggle my 3 remotes and press ONE button to do what it would take with SEVERAL key presses on the Harmony.My Harmony is now going to sit with the other remotes I never use and I'll just stick to the 3 that work for me.

"Not what I expected: My husband lovingly selected this book for me as I started on my Stepmother-hood journey with him last year. The How to Survive teaser on the cover would lead one to expect some practical advice. Unfortnately all it offered me was many varied examples of other people's situation without any direction on how 'not to let this happen to you'.I found myself disappointed at not being able to relate to the examples set fourth, and was further confused at the general message (or advice) for each chapter.I was finally able to use my yellow highlighter at the last few pages when she discussed how a stepmother may make specific contributions simply by her presence. (""a career woman may offer a useful contrast to the nonworking mother, an artist can open up a new world for a child"" etc.)

"This is a weapon, kind of: I filled this, shook it, then tried to open it. I the proceeded to slice the hell out of my hand. Let's list a couple of things that don't belong together shall we? 1) base that is poorly fitted to its lid and 2) a paper thin metal lid. It sticks, then you slice yourself. It has a really bad design. I cut myself (really it did) at the base of my thumb, which is a really fun place to get cut.I was not drinking at the time of this incident. This was my first attempt at using it.The worst thing about this is that alcohol inhibits blood clotting. so to make the bad situation worse, you are faced with a decision. Be smart and don't drink and let the body heal itself or do you drink anyway and go through about 20 bandaids more than are necessary. What do you do?Don't buy this. If you have a friend or family member that has a birthday coming up and you wouldn't mind seeing them bleed, then you are a horrible person am this might be your best bet.

"Too too. Beautifully shot and erotic...but pretentious.: There are interesting ideas in ""Sense,"" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing. Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing. Pressed to find a category in which to put ""Sense,"" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one. I think what ""Perfect Sense"" might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go, which is in every way better than ""Perfect Sense."" If you haven't seen ""Never Let Me Go"" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with ""Never."" (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than ""Perfect Sense""--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)

"Very WILSON PHILLIPS: If anyone wanted to research early 1990's fashion for a Beverly Hills 90210/Wilson Phillips/Shanice/Alannah Myles/Milli Vanilli biographical movie, take a look at the photographs in this book. The pictures are awfully dated but the techniques are less dated. Why do designers get caught up in such non classic fabrics and colors (sandwashed silk and purple with red)? Still a useful book too if you want to set up a hippie craft stall at your local bazaar.

"Really not that great: This movie has a couple of funny dialogue scenes, but it never really gels. The characters don't feel very developed. The story just isn't very involving.

"Expected more from the brains behind Lotus Notes: I've known about Groove since it was first delivered by my former Lotus and Iris colleagues. This was my first opportunity to use Groove in a heavily collaborative environment. Three companies, two in Canada, and one in the US. Sharing documents really shouldn't this difficult. On a different account, we're using SharePoint, but it requires VPN access. So, Microsoft offers a dozen ways to share files, but none are interoperable.

""" FEEBLE CONCLUSION "" This reader feels vaguely insulted.: The feeble ending leaves me confused. Why would someone write so well and then show so little thought as to the conclusion of the story? Remininscent of a much poorer genre. I enjoy Cromwell's previous books and so I will suspend my judjement until I read her next book. BUT 2 such poor efforts would cause me to consider dropping her from my reading list. I currently read a book every FIVE or six days so I consider my self a good supporter of authors.

"Sony Ericsson Needs to Fix the Walkman Audio Hiss Problem: Great price on a great phone if you get the contract with Cingular. However, don't think you'll be able to ditch your dedicated mp3 player. SE has been very slow to address an audio hiss issue (caused by a firmware update) with the Walkman player on this phone, and it's not even clear they ever intend to fix it for this product. A great chance for SE to hit it out of the park with an amazing all-in-one device, but this audio problem on a WALKMAN-branded phone is ridiculous. And yes, I have the latest firmware. It fixed the Acura handsfree link problem, but audio is still sub-par.

"Ugh!: I confess that I'm not a big fan of romance novels; however, I have read and enjoyed some of Devereaux's books in the past. This book was one big disappointment! I didn't enjoy the muddy plot and less than compelling characters (so much more could have been done with this motley crew!!), and I especially didn't enjoy inviting the devil to be part of the story! Why??? She could have gone in so many excellent directions but she chose not to do that and she lost me before I got to the end. I kept pushing on, hoping for something better, but I stopped reading not long after the devil started visiting. A friend gave it to me ""for keeps"" but I definitely didn't keep it! Jude...I haven't read a lot of your work, but I've read enough to know that you're better than this and I can certainly make better use of my time!!

When it's plugged in and recording, it makes random loud clicks that send the audio meters to red.

"i am pissed...: not only because this movie sucks so badly, but because i actually bought the thing. A suggestion: get the ORIGINAL Maximum Overdrive, based off the same Stephen King story this one is. MO is much better; in fact, it's one of my favorite horror movies of all-time, and I've seen alot of them.Overall, if you're a fan of over-the-top campy acting, a storyline that doesn't work as well as the original, and overall a movie that just plain sucks, then my friend, this one's for you. If you have even one brain cell in your body, then don't buy this Ford P.O.S. (if you can tell me what movie that's from, I'll personally pay you $20...) You'll be glad you didn't.

"Melodramatic Autumn: The chemistry between the two lovers is lacking; the man is old enough to be the woman's father, but that is not the stumbling block to the romance--the woman is terminally ill.

"Extreme conservation propaganda film: Swine flu will kill millions! Gasoline will triple in price soon! There will be riots when stations run out of fuel! Food riots are coming! The USA is using so many resources on earth and all these problems are because of the USA! That's a basic summary of this film.Of course, if you've read about ""ClimateGate"" and how there's no scientific basis for global warming, you understand already. You don't need to stop driving and move to a commune that eats only organic food and recycles everything. The world isn't ending tomorrow, regardless of what this film tries to convince you. Sure, we should conserve and develop technologies to find cleaner fuels. Maybe if this film discussed that instead of attempting to create a panic, it would at least have some redeeming values.

"A painful read and poor reflection on both men and women.: ""The Rules"" is a contemporary manifestation of Victorian female gender notions which are responsible for many of theanti-feminist stereotypes that have bogged women down for centuries. In the Victorian era, women's identities revolved soley around males as they were passed as chattel from father to husband. Women who did not marry, were deemed inferior. In order to capture a husband, women resorted to such cunning and manipulative behaviors as proposed in ""The Rules"" which is not only dishonest but a severe disservice to men who would then be as shallow, wooden puppets led around by the nose by women who can't be who they are.

"Review: So Bad It's Good: (...)This is a particularly gory and bloody play, with at least one murder / rape / mutilation / act of cannibalism in every act, and others being planned-very sadistic, and not at all nice. The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, all actuated by some horrible form of revenge or sadism, and all plotting against each other, all two-faced (...). What little comedy there is, is black as the soul of the Moor Aaron: the comedy comes from the scene in which the Andronici are arguing over which of them will chop off their hand and send it to the Emperor; and from some of the worst lines in Shakespeare (...). On the subject of bottoms, the best use for this play is as toilet paper.

"Fluffy and lacks acting skills: The whole movie was completely pointless with hillary duff dancing around like some maniac. There is only like one scene in the whole movie without hillary and the plot is completely unbelievable. The only highlight of the entire movie was the extremely HOT italien rock star, Paulo Valisari, who in my opinion is the only one that can act. Yet, the only decent character turns out to be evil in the end! I guess fans of the series will enjoy the sometimes romantic parts of the movie. On the whole, the movie was bad, but if you like hot foreign guys and hillary duff, i guess u may enjoy this film.

The band on this bra was HUGE - it fit more like a 36 or bigger. The cups had an odd shape that was very unflattering, and were too thin - the 'headlights' would definitely show through.

"One of the worst books I've ever read: This was a poorly written sob story by a wealthy American doctor. She desperately desired her cruel parent's approval even with years of evidence that 1) they would never give it and 2) it would be worthless, since they themselves were worthless. They treated her and her siblings as donkeys, proffering and yanking away the carrots of affection and money. She blames all of this on the ""evil stepmother,"" but all complicit share the guilt. Her victim saga is sad, but she had ample examples of strength and independence to follow, which she mainly ignored. Her younger sister Susan and her Aunt Baba were the heros of the story, but the author sadly didn't follow their example. Basically, I should have been paid to read this, as it seems like a whinge to a therapist.

"Huh?????: I don't get it. This book got stellar reviews, was written by the incomparable Anne Stuart, and features a unique hero....Why did I dislike it so?Here are some of my reasons:1. I felt like the story was boring. A boring Chalice was the ""centerpiece"" of the plot and the story contained a host of characters that I didn't care for.2. A strange romance between a court jester and a lady...one that I struggled to understand and accept.3. A different kind of secondary romance between the heroine's mother and her husband.4. This was just a very difficult book to get through. I didn't like the plot, the characters, or the romance.... which should've earned it a dismal 1 star, but Anne Stuart's superb writing earn it the extra star,I recommend Lord of Danger, Ritual Sins, Nightfall, A Rose After Midnight, and To Love a Dark Lord.

"Brainless dribble!: Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the long wait since book four, and considering that I thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series. However, this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series. In fact, I must admit that I did not finish reading this book. After 200 pages of pure ""nothing,"" I finally decided to discard it. I had help with this decision, though. A good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time I began reading. She finished--only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do--and quickly informed me that absolutely ""nothing"" happens, that there is no drama, action, or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from Jean Auel.

Not worth the money. I hope my previous 4-star review had not been misleading.Pros:Very convenient for a quick morning breakfast.Healthy, too, with no need to fry eggs.Cons:The first time using the egg poacher, the machine gives a plastic smell, coz everything except the steamer is made of plastic.

"This is a CHRISTIAN movie with a STRONG Anti-Choice and Abstinence ONLY message!!!!!: This movie is simply what my title reads. This is Christian propaganda shrouded in a movie format. There are two fundamental messages: anti-choice and abstinence ONLY. There are college students in this movie that on a road trip the boyfriends sleep in a separate room and the girlfriends share a room together. There isn't ONE SINGLE kiss in the entire movie despite there being a secondary storyline of a love story between two college students. Nothing wrong with any of this but I for one do not appreciate the underhanded way of luring me into the movie to hit me over the head with the propaganda. I think the directors and writers should me honest in the description and I am sure there will be PLENTY of Christians that will choose to watch it. I do not appreciate being lured into this blatant dogmatic sermon for anti-abortion/choice and abstinence on my time and $$$.

"Shame on Murray Feiss!: I ordered this light in brushed nickel and installed it in a full bathroom as part of a total remodel. This light should not be installed in full bathrooms as it can not hold up to steam from showering. After about a year I happen to look up and noticed rust in the brushed nickel, which obviously had been occurring for quite some time based on the amount of rust. Unfortunately, when I tried to request a replacement from Murray Feiss, they informed me that it was no longer under warranty. If a light is advertised and sold as a bathroom vanity light (with no exceptions noted) it should be manufactured to be able to withstand the moisture in a bathroom. I have never had a rust issue with bathroom lighting before this. I wish I had noticed it sooner but shame on Murray Feiss for selling something that is unsuitable for its purpose and for their poor customer service. Buyer beware of their ""bathroom"" fixtures.

"The Fat Burning Baloney: This book offers nothing new on the weight loss or fat burning front. Simply pages and pages of regergitating whats already ""out there"". The book constist of 80% therories and 20% techniques. I was particularly frustrated with the section title 9 Foods That Burn Fat. I read and reread this section and it DOES NOT list ANY foods, let alone 9. The whole chapter consist of calorie counting and ""suggested meal plans"", no specfics as title indicates. My whole point was to learn WHICH foods I need to make sure to incorporate into my own meal plan.The only benefit I got from this book was the excercise plans which included great photos/instructions. Buying an excercise video would be more beneficial. Overall if you are a health novice and have no idea that body fat is bad, starving your self doesnt work,etc. then this is a good buy.

It ceased to work with any of the iPods in our family assortment, and is now only good for charging.In case you're interested, the issues were just that it would not playback. Many times the remote would indicate that it was ""out of range"" when it was an inch away.

"had potential, but...: When I first heard about this book, I was all agog- a murder mystery set in the art world! A murderer who stages death as art! But this book proved to be a disappointment. Santlofer shows flashes of brilliance- I thought the elaborate clues provided by the murderer were good, but after a point it was just tediously gory. Definitely a lack of character development and a lot of inconsistencies. Also an arbitrary ending- it seemed like the author found a character in the book and made him the murderer without sufficient background building. The end of a good murder mystery should make you nod in agreement and want to kick yourself for not figuring it out. This one just leaves you bewildered- it could as well have been Person B as Person A. If art is your thing, do read it, but keep your expectations low. And keep an art tome handy to look up the featured art!

"Died after 5 months: Single user (mostly), 240lbs. Received mattress in late January 2011, inflated and began using in February. On 25 June a ""blister"" (a large bubble) developed on the top, about 16 inches from the foot of the bed. It is in the center, 3 feet across (width of bed), 21 inches long and 5 inches high. It is getting larger as I was able to continue using the bed until this morning - 4am. Was able to keep using the bed because initially the small bubble corrected the trough that had developed in the bed.Bed was inflated to a moderate firmness and did not leak. Once I had the desired firmness set by the end of February, never had to add air.Note: If you return the mattress under the warranty, you pay for shipping.The $20 Ozark Trails mattress I got from WalMart was still working after 6 months!

"Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Garden Cultivator #GC818: The only way I found this device works well is in previously cultivated or at least dug up moist soil, and, under such conditions, it worked admirably---loosening the soil to the entire dept of the tines; but not in a timely manner. Plus it didn't make a dent in packed, dry soil nor did it remove the weeds. As to its weeding capabilities after a lengthy time period it did destroy small weeds, those not more than 1 1/2"" tall. Larger weeds got tangled in the tines. I do not recommend this cultivator over the standard rotary ones because I still had to loosen the earth, wet it down if dry, then use this tool to break the soil into smaller pieces suitable for planting seeds--removing taller, sturdy weeds all the while by hand.

If you are looking for more detail try Dover's coloring books, they make soo many great ones and have one called Mystical Mandala which is only $4 and has so much more detail. One upside for this book, in comparison, is that the designs are not on both sides of the page (as they are in dover's) but this is not enough of a problem to keep me from choosing dover's version over this one. While this book was not horrible, I will admit that I get bored while coloring in it, and frequently leave designs unfinished because I dont enjoy the material very much. As far as meditation with the Mandala aspect, I find that for me, all coloring is a form of meditation.

"What happened, Ms. Watson?: This was the first in the Jedi Apprentice series which was difficult to get through. It plodded along but then had sudden jarring plot shifts without much context. Recurring characters are described throughout the book with the same adjectives we've read in the other books of the series. If I have to read that Jedi Adi is ""elegant"" again, I'll scream. OK, this is a series operating under the rules of the Star Wars franchise so readers must expect a bit of hackneyed formula writing - but please, let's have some more detailed character development with a more flowing plot in the next book and not just something banged out quickly to meet a contract.

"An adulterous husband is never a good thing: I have to admit, I never really got beyond the husband's adultery. I like Mary Balogh's novels, but for myself this isn't one of her best. The heroine is rather wishy-washy, and it's always difficult for the hero to overcome being unfaithful to the heroine. I preferred Balogh's ""Lord Carew's Bride,"" ""Dark Angel,"" ""The Famous Heroine,"" ""Dancing With Clara,"" etc. to this one.

"Earbud not compatible with Sonyericcson T226: The charger works fine. Be forewarned, the earbud is not compatible with a Sonyericsson T226. The product details say it is compatible with ""Sony T200 series phones,"" and the earbud close-up photo shows a jack that would be compatible with a Sonyericsson T226 (a ""T200 series phone?""). The earbud itself uses a 2.5mm jack, and that is not what the Sonyericsson T226 uses (it uses a propriety connection). Amazon made good on this for me, but, if you are looking for a kit to work with a T226, this is not it.

"Disappointing: I like almost everything that Candice Olson does on her tv show. Traditional with a twist, or something to that effect is her motto. This book was published in 2006...not so long ago, right? Everything in ths book is pure, boring, traditional. There was not one picture that spoke to me AT ALL. Purchased from a Good Will, and cheap, so I'm not really mad, but it went straight to Savers.

"Not very useful: Tannen's thesis is interesting, but the whole book is just a collection of examples to back it up. She doesn't offer any ideas or opinions on how to solve the problem. She could save everyone a lot of time by whittling down the length to about twenty pages; one to lay down her point and 19 (instead of 300) to list examples.

"Anne Rice meeting her publishers quota?????: I love the works of Anne Rice. However Servant of the Bones paled in comparision to her other works. The first part is redundant, the second part lacks Rice's famous detail, and the third part...Well, I had to keep swatting myself to stay awake. To any Anne Rice fan who has read the Mayfair witches chronicles, as well as the vampire chronicals...you will be dissapointed. Servant of the Bones lacks the passion, sexuality, and fervor that can be found through out her writing. Overall, I bad choice for me. I was very dissapointed.

"Disappointed Fan: This is the book to read when you need to fall asleep. The excruciating detail will wear any reader down. I loved the series but felt the characters in this book had no personality. Ayla has become such a goody-goody with none of her previous fiery personality and Jondalar has none of the character he had in the previous books. The new characters introduced in the book are sadly lacking in development. Rather than buy Shelters of Stone, read Clan of the Cave Bear.

"Such a Shame: In the name of design Sennheiser has sacrified comfort. I bought these headphones based on their reputation for quality sound, which they do have it, but all is lost in poor design.

"Look elsewhere for books on this subject: I found this book very disappointing since there seem to be so few books geared toward designing web databases specifically with Access 97. 80% of the book's material covers everything but Acess database design.

"No way this fits a dog up to 60 lbs...Just ask mine: We ordered two of these, one for each of our dogs. Both are under 60 lbs and one's skinny enough that he can crawl between the porch steps if he's so inclined. The description is just unreal that this house is suitable for dogs up to 75 lbs. This house is for small and maybe medium breed dogs...not ours. Ours are about 40 lbs and 55 lbs. Neither could get inside. Otherwise, assembly was easy. My 10 year old daughter wanted to do it, so my better half simply supervised and gave instructions. Both houses have been returned.

"Great product, short life: I bought these for my Canon digital camera (A710-IS) and was immediately disappointed to find out they did not support both 110V and 240V input voltage. To counter this, I immediately bought some Sony batteries with the same specs that did have a 110-240V charger. I used these 2 sets of batteries through many trips.After 2 years, the Energizer batteries simply stopped working. They would hold a charge for maybe a few days then be dead, even with no use. The Sony batteries are still lasting for hundreds of photographs with each charge.I would not recommend these batteries simply because you'll need new ones within 2 years. Buy some Sony ones instead.

"Twin Cities Mike: I have been very unhappy with my Road Trip Grill with the primary source of my irritation being the poor engineering of the grill cover. Users are not able to cook food with the grill cover closed. If one cooks with the cover closed, the handle will melt, and the user is also susceptible to serious burns. My question is this: Why have a cover on a grill if you are not able to cook with the cover closed? It makes no sense.

"Good on Fundamentals, Not So Good on Proofs: This book offers brief coverage of an impressive array of ""fundamental"" topics that are likely to come up in various later courses. The value here is that in most later (upper division) math classes there is a major benefit to knowing even a little of the material from some of the other upper division classes. On the other hand, this book simply will not help you learn how to do proofs. After going about half way through the book and working on the exercises, I realized that I was no better at doing proofs than when I began. The ""hints"" to the exercises in the back of the book are really no help at all for self study. I usually know the right strategy, what I really need to learn is the correct way to express my ideas as a proof, and this book does not provide very much guidance on how to do that.

"Less than impressive fiction: The first half of this novel includes a lot of gratuitous sex and violence, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But it then seems to degenerate into endless racism and sexism. The second half, while slightly more coherent, is plodding.

"another terrible scan of a public domain book: The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions. There's to business model, so the public domain books are only available as prepared by amateurs. In this edition the verse is missing, which ruins even the first chapter. Perhaps unlike most readers, I'd happily pay $10 for a properly edited edition of any classic, but the option seems only available for recent translations.Don't buy this edition!

"Sadly, this book should not even get 1 star.: 1001 Things Everyone Should Know About Science, by James Trefil, is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is edited poorly. Additionally, many of the ""1001 Things"" are out of date and/or incorrect. Clearly, Mr. Trefil should stick to physics and stay far away from anything else, especially being an author.

"The Handmaid's Tale - Ugh!: I was disappointed with the style of Atwood's writing. It felt as though she was trying to find the biggest and most obscure words to describe the environment.

"Terrible product...buyers beware!: This has to be the absolute worst software I've ever purchased, no kidding. I wish i could give it a negative star rating, one star is way to much for this piece of junk. The firewall is a joke, even when you tell it to allow an action and remember, it keeps asking over and over until you just have to turn the stupid thing off. It doesn't block any pop-ups, can't update virus definitions. Actually, it doesn't seem to do anything except add frustration and irritation to computing. Thanks Mcafee, from another customer you cheated out of $69.95 plus tax. If you want a good firewall, download ZoneAlarm...it's free. Also, PC-cillin is a good antivirus program and and is reasonably priced. I wish I'd know these things before I wasted my money on this one.

"narcissistically delusional: All you Donovan fans can make excuses for this sloppily written claim to have invented the air we all breathed in the sixties, but wow, this book is mostly an embarrassing drag. For all the information that is useful, it pales next to the inevitable cringe that is just around the corner when he takes credit for his amazing prescience for everything imaginable. A gift from a flower to a garden? More like the gift from a turd to a punchbowl.

"Don't get ripped off: I normally don't write reviews, but I'm doing this one mainly because I want to lower the 3.5 star (average) that it currently has, so then maybe one chap won't get ripped off. It does the same thing as cheap cables, at 60x the price. The ugly copper/white/black color design is not worth the $197 premium that you're paying. Actually, I'd rather get regular black colored HDMI cable, even if both were priced the same.

"Like finger nails on a chalk board: Horrible. Unlistenable. Utter trash. If I put nonsensical, irritating sounds on a CD and said it was by Radiohead people would buy it like they are buying this album. And the good reviews? Bad taste and wanting strongly to believe that this music is good. Its like those comedy skits of people in an art gallery looking at a pure red canvas or a canvas with paint splotches by a three year old and discussing how brilliant it is. This CD is a joke.

"um...what!?: OK so 90% of the book describes myself and my husband perfectly. Neat! So Where was the part where it told me what to do about it?? The only answers were things my husband should do... he's not the one reading the book!! I thought the idea was to teach me ""HOW to tear down emotional walls and communicate with my husband "". It didn't. Just told me that I have a genuine need that he may or may not choose to satisfy ON HIS OWN, and if he chooses not to, I'm outta luck and need to avoid any temptation of getting that satisfaction elsewhere. I still feel hopeless. I still feel lonely. Im not encouraged at all. And chances are I'm going to bed alone again while only in my 20's. Can someone tell me where the answer was hidden? I read it twice trying to find it. Eaguilera@gmail.com.

"a total waste of money: this book was a major disappointment for me. i have read all this author's books and was excited to see a new one....what a shock.this book was awful. if it had a real romance in it i missed it. it was more a history lesson. if i wanted a lesson i would have a bought a history book. the female lead was selfish and stupid. she never gave a thought to how her actions effected anyone else least of all her husband. i think i would have been more interested in the story of how they met and married. maybe that was in the book but i gave up after 185 pages. you are better off to buy one of the author's earlier books.

"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR: I can't say that I love it or hate it. The ear pieces are huge so they can be uncomfortable if you're resting your head against a recliner. The sound quality is acceptable but can exhibit interference on occasion. There is a lack of bass response but overalll not too bad. As you can infer from my review, I'm right in the middle on this. Eventually, I'll purchase a better unit but for now, I'll get by.

"Embarrassingly Poor Workmanship: I love and have lived in India so my expectations were already low for this oven. But right out of the box I could see that this was not made in a modern factory for the Western consumer. Every aspect of the construction was shoddy and would not have held up to even occasional use. For an Indian villager who has no other option I'm sure this would be a God-send, but as my title says this was just embarrassing. Flat black paint cannot be wiped clean as it just comes off by merely touching it. The hardware was mismatched and already rusting. Even the black electrical tape on the glass for shipping was a joke. I could continue, but I think the point is clear. Run from this disaster of a product. (On the positive side, customer service from Sun Corp. was fantastic and made returning the unit as easy as could be. Thanks.)

"YMMV: I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked. Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair. I didn't know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try. Well, I'm sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I'm not an experienced hair trimmer user. And other models don't have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and some winch over it. In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it didn't occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned. The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars, for performance alone I would it it none as I haven't found any use for it. If I had the box it came in I'd wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL.

"Catskill end grain cutting board: This board replaces an old cracked edge grain board that I have had for decades. I just couldn't see spending over $100 for a cutting board, but I wanted edge grain to keep my knives sharp, so I spent $26.58 on this one. So glad Boos has competition. (Made in America) OWSFollow up one month later; the board is cracked and warped. It is still usable and my knives are staying sharp. The crack from the outside edge hasn't reached the groove yet and the flex in the board changes directions as I turn the board over. It should be twice as thick. I guess there is no way out of spending the big bucks for quality.

"Betrays our trust in a talented writer's story: Yuck. This was a very disappointing book. Pullman is a great writer with considerable talent, which makes this book all the more of a let down. I loved the first two and hoped the conclusion wouldn't degenerate into christian-bashing, but in the end it is mostly for atheists raising atheist children. Its shaky conceptual foundations are best described as a haphazard mix of greek mythology and plain-vanilla secular humanism. There are many, many logic gaps. The worst thing about this book is that it is for children. Adults can dismiss the nonsensical philosphical junk, but kids are more impressionable. After writing two stellar novels for children and garnering rave reviews, Pullman betrays the trust of all faith-based families with this third volume. I'm not a raving right-wing conservative, but this book offended me, and it could have a damaging effect on the faith of impressionable children.Not recommended.

"Nice loking BUT....: I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit. Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them. So I sent them back hoping that the 7's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for. I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous, especially when you have to spend so much money to get them. I am to young for this problem, with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gonna keep looking.

"DON'T DO IT!!!: I have never owned a worse vacuum. The patented swivel wheels are terrible. They don't do well from floor to rug. They get stuck. The vacuum doesn't have proper balance and falls over all the time when trying to use the hose and other accessories.I have had the vacuum less than a year and I've replaced the belts 8 times. They snap and then you can smell burning rubber. We are not rough on our stuff. We take care of them and this vacuum should have lasted several years..instead it is going to find a permenant home on the curb for Monday's trash.Do yourself a favor, get a bagless that doesn't have a belt, like the new Hover V2 bagless and beltless...you will not be disappointed.

"I got through it....: This book was not horrible. (When a review starts out with that it is not a good sign) I found it to be sided against Elizabeth or at least I found it to contradict a lot of what I have previously heard about Elizabeth. This book represented her as a woman completely dependant on men. Overall, I found myself mostly bored, but half interested in what was going on. I felt like there was way too much back story for what the book was supposed to be about (Amy Dudley's murder). By the time the climax happens the book is almost over and I found I liked the ending mostly because I was happy to finally be finished. I did learn some interesting things from this book, but overall I would have to say that I do not recommend it. I was hoping for more, but this book did not deliver.

"Sorry, but don't buy the good reviews: I am an insatiable Enigma fan. This is my favorite group of all time. I bought MXC before it ever hit it big, and I marked on my calendar with excitement for the every three years Enigma puts out a record. I own every album, every remix and every DVD. This album is good, but it is missing all the brilliant layering of the earlier albums. ""The Screen Behind the Mirror"" keeps getting degraded on these reviews but it is a far better album than Voyageur. At least the signature Enigma sound is intact on that album. Cretu has become FAR too in love with his voice on this album and it actually ruins some otherwise good songs. Also, the lyrics are unbelievably cheesy at times. The album will grow on you, but it is still an overall disappointment.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND ENIGMA! You can still ""explore"" the boundaries of music with your old sound intact.

If you sew, don't bother.

"Total POS: My mother bought this unit for my elderly aunt for her new apartment. Not only is the unit non-intuitive and feature poor (even for a 72- year-old schoolteacher), but it refused to work once the power was restored after Hurricane Isabel. I suspect that it could not handle even the most minor voltage surge when the power came back on. The unit was so new the box was still sitting on her kitchen table (luckily). I'm going to shop for an inexpensive unit from a manufacturer with a proven track record of reliable phone products (Panasonic - loved everthing I've ever owned of theirs).

"Pretty Lame: This CD is pretty lame. It starts off with a very forgettable 13:10 minute mix of the ""Hills of Katmandu"" by Tantra. Sylvester does ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", and well, I love Sylvester. The Pet Shop Boys ""Always on My Mind"" mix is next, and I just found that particular mix a snooze fest. The next cut was a cover of the song ""Venus"" by Obsession. I'd never heard of this group. After I listened to this cover, I know why. First of all, if you're going to cover a song that's been around since the 60s, AT LEAST GET THE WORDS CORRECT. Lord love a duck, it's not: ""her weapons were her crystal eyes; making every man a MAN."" Good grief. The only other cut worth any attention was Rosabel's (Featuring Jennifer Holiday) mix of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.""I expect more out of a compilation CD and guys you cannot tell me that this is what's played all the time at all the clubs. No wonder I stopped going out. Just a little too cheesy and disco-y for me.

"Make Up Your Own Mind.: I haven't seen this film and probably won't.The point is that many of the reviews here for this film quote 'what other sites are saying'.If those people had minds of their own they may be much better citizens.Ironically this movie is about a mask that takes away people's free wills.

"Love Turtledove, Sorry this stinks: For the record, I REALLY like Harry Turtledove's work. I buy them all in hardcover. This one was not up to par. Homeward Bound was insultingly repititious and boring. It seemed to be a 20 to 30 page novellette that was drudgingly expanded due to a book deal contract. Of the 597 pages I would expect that less than 30 were actually Harry's work. If it weren't for my dedication to the series and the author I would never have finished it. Frankly, it was painfull. I hope there isn't a similar 'wrap up' to the American Empire, et al series....... Sorry Harry, with all due respect and at least a 3.6 average overall, this one was a dog.

Jung and his work, and reading the editorial reviews that Mr. McLynn has presented an objective and clear account of them, I eagerly picked up this biography, but was disappointed to find it a tendentious polemic relentlessly and repetitively attacking Jung (and, by the way, I am not a ""Jungian""), dwelling at unnecessary length on the Freud-Jung relationship and insufficiently on Jung's influence as an original thinker of the XXc, and most signally, failing to present any sort of precis of Jung's seminal ideas that would be helpful to the general reader. Don't bother with this one: wait for a better biography, something on the lines of Peter Gay's Freud: a Life for Our Time.

"Don't watch this! A complete waste of time!!!: I debated on what star I should give this movie: a 1 star or no star. Dakota Fanning and Robert DeNiro are very very good actors, but this movie... it was absolutley horrible! Does any body remember Secret Window, with Johnny Depp? Well, this movie turned out to be like Secret Window, just a stolen idea. Do not watch this movie, for your own safety, do not watch this!

"Too simple, only for newbies!: This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System.Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation.Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money!

"Insulting: The title alone is a slap in the face to all serious belly dancers. On her website the video is described as thus: ""will teach how to do a sexy improvisation that will mesmerize your lover and encourage passionate experiences you've only dreamed of."" This seductress image does nothing to help our dance form. If Amira really loved this dance, she would not insult it by making a video like this.Once more, it doesn't even accomplish what it says it will. I showed her supposed seductive dancing clip to my boyfriend and all he did was ask ""what is she doing?"". I told him she was seducing him and he just rolled over and took a nap instead of watching the rest. The dancing is so bad I don't think anyone could get off on it unless they REALLY used their imagination, or had a thing for bad dancing. You can see her performance here: [...]

"Radar detector review: I was not happy with the shipping as well as the product. I paid for next day delivery and took off for that day from work only to get it 3 days later. My whistler 90 was better than this product. I would love to return this product but you only get 50% of your money back if you open the product. So how are you suppose to test it if you don't open it. Hhmmm. Food for thought.

"Broke too easily: I managed to drop the power splitter removing it from packaging and shattered the plastic ring around the power tip. I was able to glue it back together and use it on a trip, but it broke again when I removed it from the socket. Even while it worked, it was very sensitive to any movement of the plugged in devices and lost power frequently. I need a splitter, but I'll replace this one with a socket with separate leads to power my GPS and cellphone versus a solid unit with integrated plug-ins.

Since many people here are having trouble finding good music, I suggest they all go out and buy a Depeche Mode album. No matter what music genre you prefer, everyone has a fave DM song. Sure, they ain't Punk, but it's amazing music. Get Ultra, Music for the Masses SOFAD, Violator, Black Celebration. Hell, get any DM album instead of this sorry excuse for music. If you're strapped for cash, you can buy DM singles for just $5.99, and oftentimes you get up to ten b-sides as well as the single song.

"juvenilia: Utterly crazy to give this Cioran-lite five star reviews.This book is valuable inasmuch as it allows us to see the mind that wrote The Temptation To Exist and The Trouble With Being Born assemble its materials and sharpen its turn of phrase, but that's it.

"Advertisement for Kolman: I bought this book because of my interest in the subject.Ze'ev Kolman may be a wonderful healer. I have no first-hand experience of him so I cannot comment on that.However, I was very turned off by the writing of Hans Holzer.The book reads like an infomercial.I wanted information; instead I got a very long and not terribly useful advertisement for Kolman.We are informed how to contact him for healing at very high prices.Actually, there are many wonderful healers out there. I have worked with some of them or met them. They are people of integrity in most cases.None of them commissions a book to hawk themselves like a product in the marketplace.This book does a disservice to Mr. Kolman if, indeed, he is as great as Holzer claims.

"WARNING: This is a tuna byproduct...NOT flavored tuna...: ...with 13 grams of added vegetable fat!!While the label states that it contains 21 grams of protein, it also states there are 15 grams of fat, 13 of which are unsaturated...ie, from added vegetable oil [canola & soy..which have their own health issues].Compare this to G'Day's salmon products [a much fattier fish, BTW] which have only 99 calories for the same size servings!! [They don't add ridiculous amount of vegetable oil to this product for some reason].So, bottom line: this is a very unhealthy tuna fish byproduct...a macerated mess with so much oil added that it is guaranteed to put the pounds on! I got rid of mine...and I am writing this in the hope that others are at least aware of what they are buying. I wonder if the previous reviewers read the labels?

"don't buy this book: I agree with the previous review. This book was not worth the money--in fact I returned it, and I hardly ever return a book. The title implies to me, at least, that there are tests in the book you can take, and then you can match the results to various careers. The test consist of psychological questions, and after you finish taking them, evidenly you are suppose to figure them out, with no guidance. It doesn't even give the HINT of what careers you may be suited for--there is NOTHING about careers in this book. An extremely misleading title.

"Lost in the Movie...!: This movie completely escapes me. I read all the reviews before seeing it, and was expecting to be pleasantly surprised.At the end, all I could see was a couple of lost souls wandering around tokyo, looking lost themselves. If the movie was ""intelligent"", I certainly missed it.Neither of the actors possessed any emotional latitude. They just wandered thru the movie lost themselves.After this movie ended, I caught the last 1/2 of the ""Last Samurai"". At least this movie did not pretend to be something else, and what you saw was what you got.Don't waste your time on ""lost in translation"" or you'll be lost yourself.

"Sift Carefully: Gerber makes a few very insightful points in this book, especially early on. However, as he progresses they become fewer and more obscure. He gradually deteriorates into a new age/zen rhapsody and becomes increasingly unclear, inconsistent, and wrong. Even some of his more lucid points require hard swallowing or careful synthesis. He then closes with a poorly veiled plug for hiring his e-institute to fill in the blanks, which have mushroomed by then.

"So boring, so disappointing!: I started this book and put it down a third of the way through. I found it boring, boring, boring. I friend advised trying to finish, so I picked up where I left off and read another third of the book and found it no better. I decided not to waste any more time on a book I disliked. It was not only boring the characters didn't mesh, the plot was chaotic and confusing. This was the first book I read by Anya Seton and I doubt I will try another. It is also the first book I have ever put down without finishing. As an avid reader for over 50 years, and I especially love historical fiction, this was a real disappointment.

"Crap is crap - in any media format.: Set aside all that plastic artsy-fartsy intellectually enlightened critical dialog you've been reading, and you end up with a movie illustrating the sick fantasies of de Sade's criminally insane brain cells on celluloid. Blood, feces, and torture - that's it. That's the subject matter. I watched it out of curiosity, and regret it. The imagery of the two men french-kissing with excrement on their mouths has been difficult to erase, not to mention the child rapes, the scenes of mutilation, and total absence of responsibility for the creation of such an otherwise gross and boring film.

"Stripped Boring Read: I have read several Brian Freeman books but found his book Stripped to be much too long and boring. It has a good plot but too many subplots that had no place and were unnecessary to the story. The whole subplot about Serena was boring and a waste to the plot of the book. As a result of reading this book, I am reconsidering reading any more Freeman books. I loved some of his previous works and wish Maggie and Stride were back again.

"Reality-Check on the Scary-Book: A senior developer friend of mine recommended this book to me.I wish he hadn't.This is the sort of book that anyone with half a mind could throw together. It cannot be called a parody, as it doesn't go all out (the basic key descriptions of Java and how it works is correct). You can't call it an informative read, as lay readers will accept the key information about java, and may very well take on onboard some of the dangerous, absurdist concepts that the author, CE3, introduces around the basic concepts.It's not a book for the novice who wanted a humourous, informative introduction to Java, and certainly not a book for a Java developer who wanted to laugh at the profession.A travesty of a book. Avoid.

"Could be better: This book provides detailed factual historical information, nice photographs, comparative analysis of cultures, glossary of historical terms, and a chapter summary section.There are several problems with this book.-. The writing is verbose; a typical high school student could find the book difficult to read. An example: ""Despite the earnest efforts of the Qin and Early Han emperors to reduce the power and wealth, of the aristocracy and to turn land over to a free peasantry, by the end of first century B.C.E. nobles and successful merchants again controlled huge tracts of lands, and many peasants sought their protection against the demands of the imperial government.""-. This book does not summarize AP essay related information in tables or charts. The information is in the book but requires considerable effort to extract.-. The book should include a CD-ROM version of the book.-. The book is too expensive.

"Full Spectrum Warrior: This may possibly be the worst game I have ever played in my life. The game is more like a horrible RPG than and action shooter. All you do is walk around, find the bad guys and tell your men to shoot, that's right you don't even get to aim, you just tell your entire team to fire. I don't think this game even deserves 1 star!(The reason I put 1 star was because they wouldn't let me put 0) I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game. Trust me, IT'S A HORRIBLE GAME, AND STAY AWAY FROM IT! I can understand that this was made to train the troops in the field but at least make it fun like america's army! If you like this game, YOU SHOULD BE SHOT!

"Oh dear...I got ripped buying these.: The drill bits are, by far, the worst i've ever purchased. At a close glance, they appear to be are poorly machined, and the grade of metal used is too soft for basic drilling applications. The drill bits can easily bend under the slightest pressure, and they have a tendency to randomly wonder around their intended target even on soft materials.Maybe I'm being picky but, I purchased some cheap Ryobe drill bits for six bucks at Home Depot. As I drove home, I marveled as to how something so cheap could be of any use...Wait, I don't even like Ryobe power tools doh!! When I tested them my jaw dropped. They made a super-clean cut without traveling off target or bending out of shape....Wow---six bucks!!I feel terrible for writing this article, but the truth must be told. I believe that Yukon Tools will eventually improve their producs and wish them the best of luck.

"Disappointing: Following on the success of Apop's surprising 2000 effort, Welcome to Earth, I find Harmonizer to disappointing. The band is definitely following the musical structures established with Welcome to Earth and has become distinctively more pop-friendly. There are some enjoyable beats and catchy tunes, but the album finds failure both lyrically and vocally. Welsome to Earth seemed capable of hiding these weakness amongst strong song structures and effects, however, within Harmonizer, the lyrics and vocals become too dominant and become a weakness because their not nearly as strong as other artists in the genre.Welcome to Earth had me enthusiastic for this release, but after several listens, it just doesn't measure up to it. Perhaps things would have been stronger if Apop had taken things a little further as opposed to building on themes already laid down in their prior work.

"Well...: This album is true to it's name, it is a list of their greatest hits. It is not, however, anywhere close to being a list of their greatest songs.If you are a casual/passive fan looking for a solid collection of good Korn tracks do yourself a favor. Go borrow the album ""Issues"" from a friend and listen to it. If you make it all the way to the end without gouging your eyes out and using them to plug your ears, then chances are you will like this album and will consider it a solid collection of good music.If you find yourself eyeless however, unplug your ears and go buy the self-titled album and/or ""Life is Peachy"", hell even ""Follow the Leader"". That's where Korn's good songs are all hiding.0 out of 367,887 people found this review helpful.

Blade of the Poisoner joins a multitude of other generic and contrived young adult fantasies.

There are two really good reasons to own a product like this. 1- you will use healthier oils and less fat. 2- It will help make your house a little greener.

"Great, but Kindle version is very hard to read: This is one of my favorites of Parker's Spenser books, with a lot of Spenser's personal life and personality coming through -- it really brings Spenser's personality to the forefront, testing him through his relationship with Susan. If you're a fan of the regular characters (Hawk, Paul, Susan) this is a good one for that, plus a great story underneath.*But* do yourself a favor and don't get the Kindle version. It is rife with errors, particularly a very annoying type where multiple paragraphs get put together, eliminating a line break. When this happens in the middle of unattributed dialog (over a dozen times before I stopped counting) it stops the story cold while you figure out who is saying what. That's why I had to rate this excellent story a mere two stars. Get the dead tree version instead, you won't be sorry.

"Kiss This One Adios!: My Lord, is this a bad book. Since 1949 I have taught, written about and ruminated about the great conflict known as the Civil War. It took me two years to get around to read this book because my students and colleagues bashed it across the board. I just finished this book recently and now I know the source of the contempt. It is justified. Perret, it appears, has done virtually no research into the Civil War, antebellum politics or any of the main players around Grant. His psycho-babble about Grant's marriage, his relationships with subordinates and others is simply nonsense. Names, dates, places, faces and vital information is misstated repeatedly. Bruce Catton, my man, you can rest easy on your mantle as the still the most readable and accessible of all Grant biographers.

In this case, this unit performs horribly for its intended task, since it freezes every time it tries to calculate a route in New York City. For a device that can't do it's basic function I give this a 1 star.More annoyingly though is the cheapness of MAgellan not to even include an AC adapter to charge the GPS at home, given that the first screen you get at bootup says how dangerous it is to program the GPS in your car while driving!!!!Customer service is awful, as anyone on this site can attest to.If anyone has a better suggestion for a GPS please respond.

"Toshiba usually reliable, not in this case: My positive experiences with Toshiba in the past is what lead me to purchase this specific brand DVD player. My family and I went on two vacations within the last month and this was purchased for my children to watch their movies during the plane rides. Immediately out of the box the DVD player functioned very loudly when loading a DVD, making a grinding/grunting noise. It did have a beautiful picture on the LCD screen, however. The player only lasted about 3 weeks and stopped working during our return flights from our second vacation. It didn't even last one month! I would avoid purchasing this item again because, even when working, it took forever to load DVD's and was very loud when doing so. Not to mention that if you have problems with the unit, you have to send it to Toshiba for service and cannot return it to the vendor you purchase if from, which is a significant inconvenience.

"terrible waste of time: This book was terrible. Some have compared the author to Ann Rule...what a joke. Comparing Mark Furhman to Ann Rule is like comparing Ed Wood to Steven Speilburg. Actually, Furhman has writing ability but wasted it with page after page of second guessing the Spokene police. Even though a lot of it was with some justification, this is not why I bought the book. Very little was devoted to the seriel killer who preyed on Spokene area prostitues for years before he was caught. The purpose of of this review is not to honor the talent of Ann Rule, although it is considerabale, but Furhman could take a few lessons and do much more reseach into the backgroud of the killer. Perhaps I was expecting too much. I got way too little. Avoid this one.

"Don't know what happened: I love Keb' Mo'. I admit that I like his earlier albums better then his later stuff, but I I thought the Door was a really strong release. I was really excited about this album when it came out but I was really dissapointed with it. I saw him in concert recently and he only played one of the songs off this album, I was glad. Reviews here seem to be split and I've read that the realease was meant for a child's album and while there have been plenty of great albums that were meant as children's albums, I don't feel like this is one of them.

"This book made me want to cry: BECAUSE IT WAS SO AWFUL! This was the worst book I have read in a very long time. It was unrealistic. Does the author even know what size 16 looks like? I don't think that a size 16 women would be considered morbidly obese. But besides that, does the main character have any friends beside the 90 something year old lady living underneath her? What 30 something women goes to a strange bar by herself night after night except the totally desperate? The character came across to me as pathetic, completely naive and pretty much a loser. But they made it seem like it was the weight that was pulling her down. And the idea that a 17 year old lost her virginity to a 28 year old man... who the author refers to as a child himself, is just too much. I could not even finish the last 20 or so pages and had to skim through them. I don't reccomend this book unless you simply want to put yourself in a bad mood. There are much better books out there.

"CAVEAT EMPTOR!: Some of the selections which have been gleaned from various other recordings are quite good. The disappointment comes with the numerous selections performed by the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. I am sure the performers are accomplished musicians in their own right. Unfortunately, the end result is somewhat akin to listening to Wagner, Fucik, Sousa, etc. being performed by a three-piece combo who have as of late finished an eight-week engagement in the lounge of the Holiday Inn on Route 39.

"Great looking but glitched out!: WAY too many glitches to be worth it. I've never had an experience like this with a video game. For the longest time I couldn't get through to multiplayer. Then it started freezing up. If I try to stop the game it will restart the entire system. I loved the other games and the graphics are stunning and the physics are cool in this one. But wait until they fix the bugs before you purchase. What makes this thing so funny is that Take 2 interactive is trying to avoid being hostily taken over. They argue that they are worth more. I think instead of the game that saves them this might be the game that sinks them.

"An Average Album: Fabs new album Real Talk was just another album from another popular mc. I never really picked up on a real message or on his lyrics, there are a couple hot tracks like Breath and Don't Stop Won't Stop but its mainly just the beats that make Fab famous. I don't reccommend anyone buying this CD.

"Boring beginning: I started this book and read about 10 pages. The whole time, the author was going off about the different kinds of plants which grew in this garden, and I didn't even know who the narrator was, and where the garden was. It was so boring and confusing that I did not read on. It probably gets much better, but I was not inspired to read more that I did.

"Great Game, Bad Guide: I wish I could give this book a '0' in star rating, but sadly enough that would be imposible. (On Amazon.com you can't give a lower rating then one)Many of the facts in this book are incorrect (Example- Since when is Leon a Priestess?!!)and the walkthrough has some very misguided information. For example, It says once you find Katmando you can fight it, Ramda is never mentioned as reapearing, and forget Frest, because it seems that the author of this guide has!In short (Becuse I could truly rant on forever) please don't buy this guide! If you want, look for a walkthrough online, but buying this would be a big mistake!

"Whispers and Lies: I have read all of Joy Fielding's other books and have enjoyed them immensely, which is why I could not wait to read this book. I found it to be very disappointing, unsettling and, quite frankly, ridiculous at times. Looking back, I realize that a lot of it didn't even make sense. I would not recommend this book.

"A greedy oppressor of the working man: Carnegie gained his wealth by ruthlessly crushing the working man--crushing trade unions, cutting wages in the interest of profit. Yes, he built many libraries, etc. but he still died wealthy, with wealth obtained at the cost of the lives and health of tens of thousands of his employees. This is what American capitalism is built on, and we accept it as gospel truth now, without ever taking a real look at this man!

"Disappointment: As with a lot of contemporary Christian music, too little respect is shown for God and love is too often defined as a commonplace thing. The album isn't praisey enough. It's too folksy. It sounds as though we were in one of the Trump Hotels. The orchestration is run of the mill.In addition the words are too unenunciated. They talk out of the side of their mouth. In the spirit of `Heart of Worship' this works well. But on most other tracks, the singer might as well be humming. Open your mouth dude. Either that or be consistent and tell us you're a wordless dervish.Track 7 has got to be a low point. And who's the guy in the background (e.g. track 2, 2:50)? Is it George Bush or an air traffic controller? I'd sooner hear cows praising God.

"Good song, shame about the singer: I have to say that I think the song itself is catchy and it stayed in my mind, but Jennifer's vocals did not. Being on the big screen does not automatically mean an ability to sing (not that she can act, but that's another matter). I have to big up the songwriters, but I can't do the same for Jennifer. Her looks are also overhyped, and they shouldn't be the reason people buy her Cds. It's a shame; someone far more talented could have done it justice.

Will use a cable from another supplier that is the preferred 1 meter length.

"Great Movie But This Is Just A Generic DVD!: Charade is one of my favorite movies and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn gave excellent performancaes as did Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy and the Paris location scenes are very good but unfortunately these lower price DVD's have a tendency to have bad picture quality and if you are looking for the best picture possible you will probably want to either buy the pricey Criterion DVD or the Truth About Charlie DVD that includes Charade on the flip side of the DVD as a bonus feature. Both DVD's have beautiful anamorphic widscreen versions of Charade with very good picture quality. I myself can't afford Criterion DVDs which the last time I checked their Charade DVD cost 34 dollars So I bought the cheaper priced Truth About Charlie DVD and I now have a beautiful pristine widescreen transfer of Charade.

"Petroleum based dyes in here: My daughter is allergic to all artificial food colors. We have faithfully used the L'il Critter Gummy Vites. She has really liked them. They have been made with vegetable based colors. These ones have red #40, red #3,yellow #6 and blue #1. I'm really not sure why they decided to add the petroleum based dyes to these ones. They are not vibrant neon colors. They are still the same colors as the vegetable based gummy vites. Probably less expensive. I am giving them a star because they do taste good, just not for those with allergies or sensitivities to dyes.

"This isn't same as classic Pro-4AA!!!: On this newer production run, you may expect the majority of the output to be at 2.3k, with practically no bass or upper treble. This can be fixed with a headphone amplifier; however, this description doesn't match the classic Pro-4AA. What you have here is a newly redecorated Pro4AAA, and that's not the same thing. Therefore, what you receive probably won't match what you expect.The classic Pro4AA is gone. Only its appearance remains.This new item can work for voice communications, speech therapy, language learning, and many other applications where a voice-only response is appropriate. They're also useful as a movie prop.I had mistakenly purchased these for music, not realizing that they had been changed.

So I was set to really get into Little, Big.But I just don't get this book at all. Found it trite, cute, and painfully whimsical. Even the writing was wooden.

"BORING: I know there's been a lot of press on the new 'Chicklit' movement and have seen many Helen Fielding wanna-bes out there lately. some have been decent, but fluff (Confessions of a Shopaholic), but then there's this one...pure waste of time....unbelievable main character (I wanted to slap her uside the head for being so passive) and gratuitous sex..I mean, really unnecessary-I felt like the author could have given Cassandra some help with some of the laughable sex passages at the end of the novel with Anna and her guy. I mean, what was the point of that? to show how unsatisfied she was with _____? Don't waste your time.....

"Pathetic: While I enjoyed the first book, Passion, to say this book left me cold is an understatement. There was no way you could connect any kind of love between Matthew and Patience, is was just all sex scenes that were obviously written to try and shock the reader, which in truth left this reader cold and annoyed as we have all waited so long for this 2nd book. In the 1st book my heart went out to Matthew and the way he was treated and turned upon. And quite frankly I am angry at Valdez. The ending is thrown together so badly that you are left there thinking to yourself, ""Oh please"", and not in a good way. So all I can say to Ms. Valdez is, ""Poorly done, very poorly done."" For this avid Romance reader this book is in the trash, not even worth selling to a buy back book store, it needs to be put out of its misery.

"Sad, cheap remake of a 1986 classic: This is one doomed, sad production:- wooden acting, uninspired handling of dramatic tension, cheap effects. I am puzzled they bothered. This is like a grade school remake of the 1986 'B' classic Maximum Overdrive, but with a million dollars LESS in terms of budget. The trucks had more expression than the actors. After awhile you were looking forward to see it end so you can start to do something else in your life. Give it a miss. Big time sucks.

"There is No Wiz in the Wizard: I read this series because my parents read the reviews and didn't bother reading the books before they gave them to me when I was younger. Now I come back and think the good reviews of this series had to be written by the writers themselves, who in real life opened up shop as Book Critics. They are the Red Mike of the ""Red Mike Reviews"" site and from their home page pitch themselves to tour schools as experts. They don't hold themselves to their own high standards by which they busily knock other movies and authors. There is no Wiz in this Wizard boy! No imagination, no magic, just solid, too solid, writing. The court scenes lack imagination. I didn't care at all about the Wizard boy. There's nothing horrible about this series. And that's probably worse. There isn't even anything to hate in it. It's just Wizless. And it took three people to get there? I've since given my parent the Harry Potter series, and C.S. Lewis NARNIA Chronicles.

"Not a great book: This is a sailing story written many years after the event occurred. The attempts by the author to recreate the scenario and her thoughts during this terrible ordeal seem awkward.It was a terrible life event for her, I'm sure, and writing may be therapeutic for her, but this book is a stretch. There are too many great writers and great sailing stories out there that this one is a waste of time.

"WTF kind of joke is this??: Having seen SCREAM 3 a year ago (closest I can figure), I loved the movie and I saw the soundtrack at the library today..The first thing I noticed when I looked at the track listing is that only 4 of the songs in the movie are on the soundtrack CD, and for the rest of the album, what do you get? the rest of the album being bonus tracks having nothing to do with the movie!The SCREAM 2 soundtrack is good because all of the songs in the movie are in the soundtrack. Meanwhile, for this CD, System Of A Down (my fave band to this day) and Slipknot (ewwwww) had nothing to do with this!So avoid this soundtrack at all costs.

"Such a disappointment: I agree with an earlier reviewer that with such interesting subject matter, they really did a laim job with this movie. not only are there parts of the plot that just dont make sense, but the whole movie drags along like a rake through honey. some of the scene changes are so awkward that it takes you a few moments to figure out what might be going on. The only reason I rented this movie was because it sounded interesting, and Kidman was in it. I think the director knew this. this movie would have been nothing without her name. rent it if you must, but dont buy it. save your money.

"Talk about over-rated. Just boring.: I had a listen to this band because they were being touted as being groundbreaking etc. Man, it's just the usual boring adolescent death metal. Bad vocals and a bunch of minor key riffs tied together. The guys sound like they have some playing ability but they are not anywhere near Jazz Fusion as some have suggested. This is DEATH METAL. Do not be fooled. Someone liked them to Coltrane, ha ha ha ha. Gimme a break.

"More like ""Story Time"" than a Bigfoot Documentary !!!: This looks like it was geared towards Grade School Kids.I thought I was watching a Story Recital where an Adult Read to Kids with Still Photos and Maps. The Actual Cam Footage was annoying to watch due to the distortion and moving about and the VHS Footage was not tracked right leaving a static line in the upper area of the picture.This wasn't the worst Bigfoot Documentary that I watched but it isn't the Best Either.The Supposed Researchers should invest in better camcorders or at least modern ones.These Old Camcorders that were used, are terrible on the viewer.The running time is 59 Min.

"NEITHER POTENT NOR PLEASURES AT ALL: This book is neither POTENT nor PLEASURES at all! This is so far, THE WORST regency romance with uttery anemic stupid unattractive hero heroin. The hero Alex is a lack-wit bully while the heroin Charlotte is a lack-wit ninny a passive victim. It seems the logic behind the story is ill-logical. The author treats the readers as if they are retarded. Furthermore there are too many uninteresting minor characters that cause too much distraction. Also there are lot of unnecessary details that put people to sleep. The melodramatic tragic events in this book are forced and unwanted because they are not that tragic at all. The story does not flow well and lots of the dialogs are dull dying small talks. The plots suck. The only lively character perhaps is Sophie.All mentioned above make this book a frustrating read. Had to put the book away. Too many well written books out there don't waste your time on this one.

"Full of useful information, but...: The author never does address what skill level is necessary to fully appreciate this book. From my reading it should be clarified at the beginning that this book is not for beginners. Being new to ASP I found this book very frustrating to follow. It wasn't until page 51 did the author decide to inform the reader exactly how to 'run' scripts in Windows. From cover to cover I felt the book was organized poorly. However, if I was a more experienced programmer I think that I would better understand the book's layout and be able to 'fish' through this convoluted book.

I haven't bothered to read more than the (90 page!) prologue of this one and leaf through the rest... bookstores are good for browsing. From the many angry reviews here, I can see that book 10 does not restart the story any more than book 8 or 9 did. So - if you MUST read it, wait for a used paperback copy to show up. I'm going to skip the next ten WoT books.

"Beware tocopherols: If one is practicing a paleo diet, this is not the oil for you. The product contains tocopherols, which are often sourced from soy and wheat germ.

Tocopherols are left off the ingredient list in the product description and one is unable to view the nutrition label in the photo provided. I shall now have to go through the hassle of the return process because the seller is more interested in making a quick buck than providing honest information.

It was allegory on steriods. And boring. Ditched it half way through and and plan to stay as far away as possible from the author's other ""wholesome"" pablum.

"Must have recording: Sequentia has distinguished itself for their recordings of Hildegard Von Bingen's chants. I highly recommend ""O Jeruslaem"" to enthusiasts of Medieval Music and to those who want to create some ambiance for their reflective and meditative moments.

"Good Story: I enjoyed this contemporary vampire romance. I thought the characters worked well together and I would recommend this novel. Morgan DeSilva is a struggling screenwriter, who cannot seem to get any of her work off the ground. Her family used to be very wealthy but with her parents' death she found out that she no longer has any money. She must learn to support herself. Morgan moves into an old house in Maine owned by a friend, and is trying to write, but is running into a brick wall. Then she discovers a manuscript that she just falls in love with. It is a story about a vampire. Morgan decides to use this work. Dante is a vampire on the run. He is being hunted, and while running ends up at one of his hideaways which is beneath the house he used to own. He discovers Morgan, and is oddly attracted to her, but at the same time furious because she is publishing his private diaries. I enjoyed this novel and would recommend.

"Nice angle on world music: I like this album a lot. I first heard the song ""Sunset coming on"" off a compilation CD.

"Not quite the best Corelle pasta alternative: These bowls deserve five stars for their quality. They are highly functional and practically n destructible. My spaghetti used to slide off my dinner plates. With these bowls I have eliminated the problem.These are not the best value in Corelle pasta bowls, however. I spent $26 to buy four of these. Recently I discovered that Amazon is selling a set of four of these bowls PLUS a two quart big bowl for $20. That's a much better deal.If you're a value shopper, you should check out this alternative. And if you're REALLY a value shopper, then you should check to see if you can get it through Amazon Warehouse, which can often bring you an additional 10-20 percent discount.

After sleeping in many hideaway beds I can say this cot outperforms them all. You don't really need a pad just a sleeping bag or bedding. It did just what I expected of the product.

"The World Wasn't Ready For These Ladies: In 1999, female trio Blaque came out of the gate with their first single ""808"". TLC immediately came to people's minds when notice was taken. And although this group resembles the ladies who were not ""too proud to beg"" over a decade ago and the fact that they are the discovery of the late Left Eye, the ladies of Blaque have their own thing going and it's evident with their self-titled debut. They shine on their brand of R&B which is dashed with an alternative flavor. Highlights on the set include, ""Roll With Me"", ""I Do"", ""Leny"", ""Time After Time""(a splendid remake), ""Bring It All To Me"", and ""Right Here Next To Me"", just to name a few. Although their debut reached platinum status, it was pretty much overshadowed by the success of Destiny's Child who, at the time, were making a name for themselves with their brand of music. This album is a must-have.

"Great: This book explains past events in an honest way. Hannity makes it clear that he believes in morals, and absolute truths. In the first 25 pages you learn how the Clinton-Gore administration dropped the ball when it came to Bin Laden. Very interesting stuff. Hannity is also very patriotic and believes how conservative views are the best and explains his postion with a lot of clearity. Great read.

"Very beautiful, but can be too small: I do not own this watch but tried it on at a Macy's store and just wanted to help a fellow watch shopper here. This watch looks fantastic and has the most great feel on your hand. Very light, needless to say, and very classy, elegant looking. The bracelet is particularly remarkable, with that fine, just-complex-enough pattern. They looked, however, disappointingly small on my hand! (I am a 6'1"" male). So, just something to consider. This is a very popular watch, should be easy to find on a mall to try on.

"moving story of human consequences of justice: _The Book of Daniel_ is Doctorow's best novel. It tells the story of Daniel, whose parents are executed for espionage. The book presents a deeply moving story of how a country's wrath affects its citizens. While Doctorow does not take an explicit political position (not an unsophisticated one, anyway), he does gives us a better understanding of how we react to our fates, our family, and our country.

"Light them up: I previously purchased two of these lights and was impressed with their value. They were of a good quality for a reasonable price.Unfortunately, one started to malfunction. I purchased a third one as its replacement.After replacing the malfunctioning one, I took it apart, cleaned out the dead bugs and installed it at another location on my house. It functions well now.If I ever needed any other motion detector lights, I would likey make Designer's Edge my first choice.

"Great artsy biography: I watched this film for my central european literature class. I didn't expect it to be boring, but i was cetrainly thriled with the depth and talent displayed in this biography. THe DVD is set up very well, it has a section where you can listen to archival recordings of her work - arias and folk songs. It also has a photo gallery. Reading about someone on the internet is one thing, but you can not understand the magnitued of this woman or the effect she had on people until your hear someone describe her. They way the faces of these people lit up when they would talk about her music, shows just how talented she was. The biography portion isn't dull like many TV biographys are, they tie in enough of her work and intresting tidbits about Novotna to make this story really come alive. I reccomend this DVD to anyone intrested in Opera, the met, or Checkoslovakian history.

"Great start to the series: Odd Thomas stars in several books that highlight his ability to communicate with the dead and to solve many horrible murders, many linked with the mystical and occult. In his first book of the series, Koontz explains the reasons for Odd's quirky behaviors and sets up how Odd will move through his adventures for the rest of the series. You don't have to read it first to enjoy the other novels but many things that Odd does in the other books are referenced back to this one. Also his connection to Stormy Llewellyn and what happens to her will allow anyone who read the later novels first to understand Odd's feelings and inner dialogues and where he hopes to end up eventually. I've enjoyed the series so far and I'm looking forward to reading Koontz's latest Odd Thomas novel "" Odd Apocalypse.""

"I can sing along - Yay!: An awesome holiday CD. Clay doesn't go off track showing off his vocal gymnastics, which I think sometimes spoils other X-mas songs (e.g. Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey). That means I can sing along to some great classics! I prefer the classics on the CD as opposed to some of the newer stuff, but even those other songs are gorgeously done.When paired with great songs, Clay's voice just shines. He sounded good on his debut album but was saddled with very mediocre material. I hope the record company realizes how much better he is than that material and can do better for his next album!P.S. - I don't get the comparisons to Josh Groban. That guy is maybe a bit too out there for my taste, which is more popular than classical. So, for me, Clay's CD wins hands down.

I have already pre-ordered this on DVD and can't wait to see what are in the ""Special features""! If you are into romantic comedies (like ""You've Got Mail""), you will really like this movie! Lance Bass and Joey Fatone are better actors than I had expected and the movie was WAY better than I had expected! I can't wait to see this movie again, my friends can't wait to see it again. The only thing that I found ""unsatisfactory"" about this movie, is the way they edited-out the dirty language--that got kind of annoying... other than that IT WAS GREAT!

"Great set: Overall we are very pleased with this kitchen set. It includes just about everything my son could need to play in his new kitchen for a reasonable price. Some other sets we looked at were cheaper but by the time you bought three pans here and utensils there, it was going to add up to way more money than just buying this one set. Our only complaint was that the timer included doesn't work properly. We contacted the manufacturer and they said they could not replace it for us. But overall, my son loves this and I think it is a great value for the money.

"If you have chronic back pain read this book!: Hands down, read this book if you are experiencing chronic back pain and you really think there could be more to it then structural.In 1998 I suffered torn SI ligaments and ruptured lumbar discs in my lower back. After a year of physical therapy the left over aches and sciatic pains had me limping for another year. It seemed to me the chronic pain I was feeling should not have been as severe with all the healing work that was done to strengthen my back. At the end of 1999 I saw an interview on television with the author of this book. The next day I purchased the book and read it cover to cover. The following morning my back pain was reduced by 90% and it has never returned to the chronic ache that I felt for years before reading ""Healing Back Pain"".Did I mention if you have chronic back pain you should really read this book?

"total body works 5000: Needing some overall body eexercise, i found the total body works 5000 among the exercise items shown here on amazon. actually, i thought it was a total gym exerciser, because it looked so much like what I had seen in tv comercials. anyway I ordered it, and put it together.There was one weak spot, i thought in the assembly of it and that was the step that tells how to lengthen the frame, and when I did find out how that was done, I had to use a hammer to jar the adjoining tubes apart.But having successfully assembled the unit together and using it, I find it very satisfactory. Too, the total body works 5000 has a foot plate, bungee cord weight cords for added resistance and a hand and foot bar included which I don't think the cheaper total gym unit has.i think it is well worth the money.

"The Clips Killed the Rating: All of the matches were clipped. They were extremely hardcore, especially the three way dance with Sabu, Yukihiro Kanemura, and the One Man Gang. Probably the sorriest matches were the 6-man tag matches. The announcing was good, except they keep on calling a tiger driver a powerbomb. My all time favorite match on this video is the match between Tajiri and Super Crazy. The funniest part(to me, at least) was when Super Crazy flipping off Tajiri and Tajiri did it right back with a mocking face. Overall, this video is worth what you paid for.

"Great for left handers!: I've used this style Logitech marble mouse for at least 10 years, both at home and at work. Because of it's design, it's perfect for left handers who typically have issues with button placement on a ""normal"" mouse. This is an ambidextrous design. In my experience, these typically last for 3 or 4 years of heavy usage...so, they're fairly robust. They've recently gone up in price...but they're still a good value.

"Thanks for the recommendation, Charlie: I bought this book because I read somewhere that it was recommended by Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Thanks for the tip, Charlie. It's a very interesting book.The author is a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. The book is about automatic responses of human behavior, or what the author calls our ""click, whirr"" mode.The examples cover a wide range of circumstances, such as:- How a clever waiter ropes his customers into spending more and tipping generously.- How a variety of other sales people manipulate customers into buying.- Why there is a surge in suicide rates following a highly publicized suicide.- How the Chinese got American POWs to willingly write pro-Communist essays during the Korean War.The concepts are divided into six categories: Reciprocation, Commitment and Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority, and Scarcity.

"Not for beginners or the faint of heart: I haven't gotten through the whole book yet but have been reading excerpts for specific information. Maybe that doesn't work for this book. Perhaps if I went to the beginning and read it all the way through I would like it better but it seems he often digs into very fine detail and it isn't clear why (or why someone would care). Anderson does use lots of example code and has some good illustrations to make his points. I haven't used the CD yet but always consider it a good bonus resource to have when the author provides one. If I could use half stars I'd have given it a 3.5 but I didn't want to pull down the rating since I have not read the whole book.

"Good product: I got one at the venue of my fist half-marathon. The product overall claims to be very nutritious and natural. I admit that it mostly stands true to its claim and, more importantly, whole grain oats are fairly chewable and like that fact that it retains its natural texture too. As other reviewer has pointed out, taste is very well balanced, neither too sweet nor too bland. It comes with nice ziplock bag with all those printed claims that gives impression as if its a sole survivor of past 'age of raw food' and boasts of not having ingredients that any unprocessed food should not have. Neverthless, it keeps granola fresh. May not be able to convince GMO-free community since label has no mention of it (I am sure these guys would put it in billboard fonts if it were ;D).

After the two hours walking, you are so tired and thirsty that you want to take a little break. You open your wine bottle with your botton opener. ""I am hungry not thirsty,says your fried."" You'll give him your Leatherman and he begin to make a fire. Your fried uses clip-point knife and his own very sharp axe.

"A energy $$$$$$ saver a must for older windows: Spray water on and apply the easiest application on glass windows. Saw this method on a morning show - and had one window done in 10 min. [9 min to dig out a pc we had] Works super - particularily where the windows are old/old/old...........One can work mini-blind and/or roll up shades normally as this method does not hamper function of these.SW VA winters are getting to be as nasty as the north.We cut abt 1/2 inch wider than the actual glass itself. If it needs a little 'anchoring' beyond the water method - masking tape works great.Covering the bottom half of most standard windows still allows for one to see out the top half. If covering all window area as we are in one room - plenty of light filters in. One room will get 96 feet - for starters/ has triple windows. Drapes always closed - so 3 rows should do it -Also looks decent from the outside .... upl pix later

Sure, there wasn't a great deal of action, but there were many interesting plot and character developments, and I still adore Jordan's writing style. Descriptive, but not overly so.

Overall, this book was a turning point in the series, and I think readers can look forward to more fast-paced books in the future.

"A melancholy masterpiece.: Paul Auster's writing has the ability to linger long in the thought of his readers by virtue of its exquisite construction of sentences and rhythm. His plot inventions, such as the countless coincidences that happened to Fogg in this book (or those metaphysical characters in the New York Trilogy) are minor irritiation in an otherwise wry, melancholy and highly absorbing story. I could not put down the book even at three am in the morning before work. It will stay with you for a long time.

"A Cute Read- Funny, Enjoyable: This was a cute book about a lady who left her ex and the town her ex was in to move to Florida and begin a new life. And thus begins the story.The side characters are funny. I laughed at the dog, the meddling ex mother in law and the rest of the additional characters. They only added to the story rather than distracting from it. The hero was a nice guy who knew how to do his job (Police Chief). The Jillian was just as realistic to me... learning to stand on her own after a divorce, learning how to stand up to her ex, and learning how to be herself.This is not a book that requires deep thinking nor does it have a life changing lesson. But that only makes in more enjoyable in my opinion. It fits in well for a day at the park while the kids play, an afternoon read while the kids nap, etc.Enjoy.

"Second Favorite of DH1, 2 and 3: This is a review of Die Hard 1, 2 and 3. My favorite would be DH2, but DH1 really set the mold and probably should win the award for best creativity. I prefer the winter airport and snowmobile scenes of DH2 to the city skyscraper scenes of DH1 &#65533; it probably has a significant amount to do with where you grew up. Probably the same for the underground scenes of DH3, although I think DH3 was less well done from many perspectives (plot, acting, cinematography, sound). Through all of them, though, one cannot help but cheer on the good guy and be thrilled when he pulls another one off. Get all three and watch them some relaxing night.

"Extreme Guitarist: I was ecstatic upon discovering this top quality live recording of such an extreme guitarist. Melding the influences of classical, jazz, flamenco and gospel, John Scott Evans is the rising star of fingerstyle guitar. If you like Earl Klugh, Chet Atkins and Doyle Dyks, you'll love the artistry of John Scott Evans. This performance with his six-piece band, also features David Ragsdale (Kansas) on violin.

"Second release from the shred-lord: This album was Joe's second solo release. If you liked the debut, you'll like this one. The production is a tad muddled, but still, Joe cuts through. The album features two tributes to Joe's heroes - ""The Jimi Stomp"" (Jimi Hendrix) and ""Texas Chainsaw Boogie"" (SRV). Through it all, Joe simply blazes like few others can. One nice touch is that Joe makes a comment on each track in the liner notes. Very interesting reading and it gives one an insight to how Joe approached each track.

"Dark Shadows Revival, Loved it!!: This was a great purchase - reminded my husband and I of the old series we watched as kids which was black and white - but brought it up to date in that my 10 year old son really got into it. The scary movies nowadays are many times just too much. We watched the entire series, 3 disks, over a weekend with all three of us thoroughly enjoying it.

"works as described: I got the mirror very quick. Installation is very quick and straight forward if you don't mind putting screws in your roof. It causes no leaks in mine. But the screws are very short and dont pierce the outer level in case you had any concerns. The mirror is a little shakey while driving could use third support or something. I like it a lot though. My friends notice it right away. Looks great in my 93 prelude si because of my dash that spans the whole car.

"Destined to be a favorite: I have to say that this is one of the only books that kept me up until the wee hours of the morning so that I could finish it all in one day. This was about 7 years ago and that books is literally in tatters and held together with a rubber band because I have read it time and time again. You will love the richness of the characters (that is if you can find a copy of it somewhere!) The story itself will keep your attention with it's many adventures. If you find this book anywhere, consider yourself very lucky indeed.

"A delightful story that is for early teens to the elderly!: Can't imagine Christmas without this movie! It is very modern yet old in the theme of love.

"FOR EVERYONE!! A PRIMER ON GOOD HEALTH: Thyroid Power was a pleasure to read. It is clear, easy to follow and understandable to me, a non medical person. The information is presented in a manner that is conscise and VERY helpful to my everyday life. The '10 Steps' are things that I can accomplish and in fact most are very easily adaptable to any lifestyle. I noticed that I found myself nodding my head often, feeling that here at last are experts who truly understand MY experiences and are able to tie together and make sense out of what had seemed to me disparate symptoms/issues. I am encouraged and feel supported to make the positive changes spelled out by the Drs. Shames and additional I am better armed to work with my primary care physican with good questions and ways I can do more to help get me what will be optimal care. I expect great results.

"The ""Pop"" Quizzes are worth the price: Now, my wife gave me Keeping the Baby Alive as a humorous shower gift, so I didn't actually pay for the book. But before long she knew just how funny it really is when she heard me cackling from two rooms away. The multiple choice tests on Feeding and Walking-Talking made me laugh the loudest. Folks who do not see the humor here, well, my guess is half of them are overly protective wives and the other half are young fathers with a serious case of new-dad ego. Not being that young, maybe it's easier for me not to take parenting too far over the top, and still take time to laugh at myself. Either way, none of the above means I love my little girl any less.Keeping the Baby Alive till Your Wife Gets Home

"My Pokemon crazed son won't part with Pickachu: I bought this for myself because I love Pikachu. Not sure why, I just do. But my eleven year old son saw it before I got it to the office, and he is almost inseparable from this guy. He was the very best at Pokemon in his entire grade school last year, and the craze seems to show no sign of ending. This fluffy Pikachu continues to pop up all over our house, sort of like when we had beenie babies everywhere. For the kid who loves Pikachu, suggest you get one (gotta catch em all?)

"The kids will love it - you will hate it: I saw this movie in the theater with my kids. They loved it. I was so bored I could barely stand it. Although I was impressed by the message that the movie was trying to convey to kids.We just got the DVD. My kids still love watching it, but now I don't have to! Fact is, if your into Pokemon you will enjoy this movie even with some of the flaws that others have mentioned. I was not the intended audience so it's no wonder it did not impress me.I am a DVD collector however, and did enjoy clicking on the many features. The menu is kinda neat with the different Pokemon popping up. The video quality is fine too but am extremely disappointed that it is not widescreen as was shown in the theater. It also comes in those cheapo paper DVD cases.

"Good, but not the best Doors video: This video is very cool, lots of rare clips (the recording of Wild Child in the studio is my favorite), but there is some random clips from early music videos which are not very good.

Anyway, if you're looking for rarities, buy this video, but Live at the Hollywood bowl is a much better choice if you want a raw Doors performance.

"Light on His Feet... way to go Ed!!: So me and my best friend go into NYC on February 21st, hoping to catch a matinee. The show we're hoping to see isn't playing, so we quickly decide to go see some play called A CLASS ACT, about the guy who wrote the lyrics for A CHORUS LINE. My school is doing that play...it might be educational to find out about the guy who wrote it, right? It was still in previews, but we figure, 'what the heck. Broadway is Broadway'. So, I have no clue what to expect... and I end up loving it! GO SEE THIS PLAY! I cried at the ending when they sang ""Self Portrait"". I think my favorite song is LIGHT ON MY FEET... or is it PARIS THRU THE WINDOW? Or any other of the wonderful songs in the show... I can't wait for the CD to come out, and I'm kicking myself because I didn't buy the CD at the show. GO SEE IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!

"Finally I don't have to shave everyday!: I just used this product to wax off my armpit hair. I have to shave everyday, my whole body, and it grows back within 12 hours. So I decided to wax for now. I grew hair out for 4 days, applied thin layer of wax to armpits as directed, then drank a few beers & had hubby pull the strips! Vuala! no more hair! Honestly the first strip took the bulk of the hair out, then I had to apply it maybe 2-3 more times in small areas where the hair grew in a different direction, then pull again. It really didnt hurt bad at all. A couple of times it stung but went away in a few seconds. I had maybe 3-4 hairs left after all was done, so I plucked the last few. The oil relieves the sting immediately & keeps your armpits from feeling sticky.Great product! Looking forward to waxing bikini line & legs for summer! And not having to shave twice a day!

"Enigma hits the right spot again!: To all those fellow Enigma fans, this is a great album. They still preserve all those qualities that we love, all the beautiful rhythms and melodic sounds. Although this album was beautiful, I felt that I should expect a little more. Maybe a few more 'complete' songs, perhaps a few more rememberable songs.... I recommend this cd for all Enigma fans and all ambiance lovers, but I would first listen to ""Love Sensuality Devotion"" and if you're torn as to which cd to get first, I suggest the latter. Don't get me wrong, ""Screen"" is very well put together and is very beautiful, but ""Love Sensuality Devotion"" is much more rememberable.

"Better Than Expected!!!: I saw this earlier, and I thought it was decent and fun for the whole family. It has a solid storyline and a good message, along with tender moments. Joey King was cute and adorable as Ramona, but Beezus didn't really do too much. Ramona Quimby is a hyper 3rd grader with an overactive imagination. When her dad is hired, she bonds with him and tries to build up his confidence, while trying to save the house and deal with her aunt falling back in love with an old boyfriend. I would recommend RAMONA AND BEEZUS!!!

"A strong book that covers many aspects of the subject: This is perhaps the most well researched book of its kind I have read and one of the few that tries to incorporate science into the equation--which is not a bad idea as it turns out. I did find the author jumping around a bit instead of following a logical progression, such as grouping all of the flirting pre-date techniques in one section, finishing with that section and moving on (not as in this hypothetical example: pre-date, date, pre-date, post-date, date, etc., consecutive sections). Despite the organization, this book does take you very completely through the entire dating process, perhaps more so than any other book on the subject. Because of this, I highly recommmend it--just be prepared for several readings and maybe even some note taking to fully benefit from its wisdom.

"Good collection of Coleridge's works: S.T. Coleridge is an interesting poetic figure. An opium addict who imaged an imaginary country called 'Xanadu', based on an Asian legend about one of the descendants of Genghis Khan, Coleridge's visions are very scattered and lacking in unity. His poems, while some soar to great heights, are often confusing or pedestrian, and in this regard he is a lesser poet than Blake or Milton.Despite this and his constant dabblings in various religions and his unsystematic attempts to grasp a deep unity in the universe and in all knowledge in the realm of the spirit, along with some beautiful poems like the Ancient Mariner and some good essays and prose works (such as the Biographia) make Coleridge an essential part of any canon of English literature. He is a genius, even if not an outstanding one, and worth reading at least once.The Oxford Collections are generally of very high standard and worth purchasing for every canonical author.

I'm a huge Rachel Morgan fan and the third installment didn't disappoint, except that I missed the irrepressible Jenks during the second half. As much as I love Rachel's vamp, elf and were friends, I am completely besotted with Jenks, Matalina and their pixie brood. The story is moving forward nicely, with hints and puzzles both broad and obscure, and a surprising change in Rachel's love life. I'm still holding out for her to end up with Trent, but the sexy Kisten makes a nice playmate for Rach after that wussy Nick.

"Now I don't have to squint like Clint.: I received this from Amazon the day before its release. Yay USPS! It looks really good on my PS3. I immediately noticed a difference from the TV version, aside from the sharper image; there's letterboxing (2.4:1) that was removed from the Cartoon Network presentation of the show. It now has a more cinematic feel on the Blu-ray (as well as a bit more image on the left and the right). The packaging is similar to the first season, though the book can now be removed from a sleeve. Strangely, the cover of the book reads: ""le GUERRE dei CLONI"". I thought for a moment that I had the Italian version of the book, but the cover art and the artist's note inside the front cover made it clear that it was an homage to the spaghetti western. Thankfully, there are no games among the extras. There are several different language options, but no commentaries that I could find. Good package overall.

"A Mystical Journey for Love: I totally dig this movie. And, I'm a big action movie kinda guy! C'mon folks. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just a light hearted adventurous romp travelling throughout a different side of Europe. Involving a sundry cast of funny and interesting characters, it takes you along and away with them. Take a chance and have a fun night watching this movie. Much better than some of the garbage that passes itself off as ""hip and edgy"".My next question is where can I find the soundtrack? There is some excellent music being played throughout the background of this movie.

"Author reveals the truth about Ismaili Faith.: This is the first book ever written on this topic from an Ex-Ismaili, who reveals the secret practices of Ismailis. Ismailis claim to be a sect of Islam but this books tells us the everything they practice is against Islam and teachings of Holy Quran and Prophet Muhammad. Ismailis commit blasphemies in the name of Allah. They associate their Imam with Almighty as the God incarnate or God manifest in the human form and this book unveils those practices at all. I shared this book with some Ismaili friends and they were astonished that how ignorant they were about their practices. They were clueless about what they uttered as words of prayers were nothing but sins according to Quran. A must read for all. I recommend it time and half.

"4.5 Stars... Sophomore album explodes with energy: Black Rebel Motorcycle Club returns 2 years after their dark debut album that made them indie-superstars in the UK (but not the US). ""Take Them On, On Your Own"" is better than the debut album, by far.The tone is set with opener (and first single) ""Stop"", which reminds me of the brash early-Oasis sound, just great. The first 6 songs of the album are sequenced just perfectly. ""We're All In Love"" has a great wall-of-sound, as does ""In Like the Rose"". ""Ha Ha High Babe"", with its threathening bass and intricate drums, is another highlight. The second half of the album is not as strong, altough ""Shade of Blue"" (one of the few slower songs on the album) and ""Rise and Fall"" are other standouts.It will be interesting to see whether this album will get BRMC the recognition in the US that it deserves but has eluded so far. Altough a bit overlong (55 min.), this is a great album, and one of the nicer surprises of 2003.

Some of her technique is a little different than what I was taught by my Kendo Sensei in college, (he was a champion from Japan) but this is a workout video and not an instructional video. I got lots of giggles from Ilaria's accent (mainly the word ""diagonal"") and I liked how she explained the sword movements pre-workout. If you are tired of traditional workout videos and want something to change up the routine, I recommend this video. I also recommend buying a bokka from Amazon. Got mine for around $10.00 with about $2.50 for shipping and handling. You could use a broom handle but I wouldn't like that.

"Never change your radio station again: All you need to know is that there is an international mode that allows this device to operate in completely empty frequencies in the 80s. To accomplish this, hold down the ""preset"" button until the US mode flashes. Change it to international. Then go down to 87.7 or 87.9 and enjoy a clear band.If you have the problem of the international mode power saving bug (the device shuts off automatically after one minute, no matter what volume you set your audio device to), just save the low frequencies to the memory, then switch back to US mode. Your transmitter will say that you are at 107.9FM, but it's actually at 87.7 or 87.9, and the power saving bug is not an issue.

"Sweet Read!: Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day.

"The Remix: The original album version is already ill but DJ Premier flips it nicely with his re-mix. I've always imagined how The GZA would come off on a Primo track. The remix doesn't include new verses but Primo aptly provides a track that supports both Afu's and GZA's lyrical styles. The bouncy horn loop and drum break tandem merge perfectly with the rhyme schemes of the two MC's. The GZA's sharp on-beat, off-beat flow is air tight whether it's over True Masters more wicked track or Primo's snappier remix. Afu's straightforward delivery is less impressionable but it's still effective. The contrasting feel of both mixes is what makes this such a hot plate. Pick it up and listen for yourself.

"Light and funny: I'm not really sure why this film seems to be rated so poorly. It's a cute, light film about a modern day Bewitched. I think some people were expecting a simple story about the actual show, I think this film was better because it avoided that easy storyline and went for something a bit more involved. The story is about the remaking of the classic television show Bewitched but this time it's been retooled so that Darrin is the star (Ferrell). In comes Samantha (Kidman) who actually is a witch and hilarity ensues. I really enjoyed the film and thought both Kidman and Ferell had some very funny moments. I also thought their supporting cast was very good.

It completely relaxed you and your muscles, so I know I won't be as sore tomorrow. And the other great thing about this video is that once I have gotten used to doing one of the 20 minute workouts, I can eventually do both. Weight Loss Cardio Kick is completely recommended! During the workout she knows when the tough parts come along and really pushes you to go the extent you need to go. I will post some of my body results after I try this for about a month. For I'm not overweight but am trying to lose the last 10 pounds.

"Lovable: I thought the variety hour was cute! Nick & Jessica both did a great job at acting together! I loved it but I'm not sure if everyone will cause I didn't laugh at every single joke cause some were just corny... So I give it four stars instead of five. But other than that I thought the show and singing it's self was cute!

"Nice, very nice: These are good.For those slow and sensual session where you both want to feel the subtle slow sensual warmth of each other, these will work.But when you decide to pump up the speed and get your self to the finish line... I felt desensitised - which for some may be a very good thing, but not for me. When I want to arrive, I want to arrive, and these kind of kept me from the edge.To the point that I eventually took it off and slid into something thinner. Ahhh that did the trick....So yes - these are great.

"Indispensible for the new or experienced instrument pilot: Sweet Talking the System is an excellent book on how the AirTraffic Control (ATC) system works, and how pilots can workwithin (and sometimes around) it to get the most effectiveair traffic services.I think the single best feature of this book is the juxtapositionof articles from both sides of the radar scope; you get boththe controller's view and the pilot's view of many issues.The thing I found most interesting in this book was the tipson how to avoid preferred routes; it's not a great problemout here in the West, but based on the descriptions, I canimagine that working around them in the East Coast areas(especially around New York) could be very beneficial.Additionally, the chapter on radio communications has someexcellent points, especially in the ever-continuing debateabout using the AIM recommended phraseology over the air.

"A wonderful book: I read this book in late 2002 when people were always asking me why I hunted and why I liked it so much. It was very helpful to hear someone else put into words what I felt but couldn't articulate.This book clearly spells out the dangerous agenda of animal rights groups, how they exist merely to perpetuate themselves and how little they actually do for wildlife conservation. He does this without personal attacks or bias, but with statistical facts, and personal examples. This book is very well-written despite what some people have posted hear.There is also a spiritual side to the book that honors animals and nature like I've never heared from an anti-hunter. This author truly lives in nature and loves nature, like all hunters do.

"Hands up for ""Alvin"": Alvin Youngblood Hart proves that he is indeed a modern man with his new CD Start with the Soul. He may have entrenched himself in the Delta, but he still knows how to rock.Start with the Soul once again demonstrates Hart's interest in a wide range of musical styles coupled with his ability to adapt them for the pleasure of the modern listening ear.Once again, Hart displays his ability as a songwriter with pieces like Fighting Hard, which is somewhat reminiscent of My Back Pages. I am particularly fond of Manos Arriba which Hart says he wrote after being stopped by police with his young son in a stroller.Once again, I commend Alvin Youngblood Hart for his ability and his new CD and hope to continuing hearing from him in the future.

"Excellent Resource!: This book answers a lot of questions that preachers have about teaching the Old Testament narrative passages. It not only talks about the ""why"" but also answers the ""how"" as it provides many examples of how a person might preach narrative portions. It also gives a lot of instruction about how to tell/present stories in general. This is good for the preacher wanting to refine his communication skills.

Luckily I had some screws on hand that would accommodate a larger Phillips bit. Those did the trick!All-in-all four stars. If the stock screws had worked I'd have given it five stars as the installation would've been more like five minutes rather than thirty.

"One of the greatest records of the past 15 years!: This record might sound even better today than it did the first time I heard it in 1997.Amazing songs both lyrically & musically, but what a stunning performance they captured on tape. This is truly one of the best records I've ever heard in terms of capturing the essence of what a great, powerful and rocking live band sounds like onstage.I've been listening to this non-stop since their Too Far To Care anniversary show in NYC a few weeks back. 15 years later they are still rocking the daylights out of all these classic tracks.Long live Old 97's!!!

"Wittily funny: I'm not going to bother typing a synopsis of the film so here it is: this movie is sensitive, emotional, and intelligent. The way the director Greg Mottola arrives at this is by wit and then through that, laughs. Many of the employees at Adventureland are underemployed; they need to work at the park because of financial circumstances.Although the film isn't truly a comedy, there are jokes here and there, namely by Martin Starr's character, Joel. Nonetheless, these jokes are intelligent or at least leaves one in awe as we understand how vast their knowledge is.

Jas and Rom are not the typical hero/heroine--they're unique and wonderful and fill this story from cover to cover. The outerspace/sci fi parts of this book complete the romance but never overshadow it.

"Queensryche - Geoff Tate Hittin The High Notes: Queensrryche's first full length release is still a favorite of mine after all these year. They would go on to do better albums, but this one showed that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the metal world. Geoff Tate's voice was at its peak on this one. Some of the high notes he hits are mind boggling. The album is full of twin guitar histrionics and outstanding drumming. Yea, it all sounds a bit dated today, but for early 80's power metal this is a very nice sampling. The band would have an AOR hit with ""Take Hold Of The Flame"" which is still a concert staple to this day. Other highlights include ""Warning"", ""En Force"", ""NM 158"" and the progressive metal finale ""Roads To Madness"".

It of course, pertains to life and makes you feel like it actually is a beautiful day.

They're wrapped individually quite nicely - better that those cheapie plastic things the other products use. These are cloth-like so you don't hear them being unwrapped in a public place. Also, the bag has a drawstring for super easy closure compared to nothing on the other products. Highly recommend!

"Good Album: With this album Everclear proves they are more versatile than many people thought. For me this comes with mixed feelings, while none of these songs are bad there isn't really a brilliant one (although el distorto de melodica is badass) and it made me miss the types of songs that filled World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade. The problem I think is that they made a pop record without intending to. For instance, their newest Learning How to Smile I believe did a better job because they went in knowing that was the type of album they wanted. This one goes back and forth. That being said this is still really good and I highly recomend it (you might not share this gripe anyways)

I enjoy the ritual of making it. There is nothing numinous about making coffee with a drip maker.What is really great is that you can also treat yourself to lattes, machiatos, or any espresso drink whenever you want. It makes an awesome brew that seems to have less acid and no burnt taste. Everything I've made is smooth and delicious. I love the thick, caramel colored brew.I would definitely recommend this to any coffee lover

"Probably the most exiting album of the year!: This album makes me happy everytime I hear it( almost everyday), it is so much better than Live Through This, because it has more passion in its songs, and it's full of happiness. Courtney was really inspirated when she wrote the album lyrics, they're so cool and the songs are delicious to listen to. I love it and recomend it to everyone who still have a doubt on buying this, it's gratious and has also the hard guitars that are on the Live Through This as well. I mostly enjoy the songs ""Awful"", ""Calebrity Skin"" and ""Heaven Tonight"". A must hear!!

"Perfect for the beginner or the advanced: Coming from someone who loves to be in the kitchen, it's important to have a great cookbook as a reference and as inspiration. I am a raw foodist, and I own many many raw cookbooks. This is the one I use the most. I have tried several of her recipes, and have yet to find one that isn't amazing. Renee offers a little bit for everyone, including several dressings, salads and soups that take no time at all and very few prep tools. She also has some more challenging entree recipes for those who are looking to impress.The thing I like most about this book is how much of it she dedicates to the lifestyle of a rawfoodist, describing unusual foods, connecting food to spirituality and yoga, and bringing a wonderful uplifting flow of energy to the reader. This one is definitely a must have among raw foodists and an enjoyable read for anyone interested in the wellbeing of themselves and the wellbeing of the planet.

"A great tool kit for the new witnesser: If you are like me, one of the toughest parts of being a Christian was being unable to share with others the joy and peace my faith has brought me. I'm kind of quiet to begin with, and feel like I don't always know the best way to say things. I know I am not alone in feeling this way, but I was surprised to find out that a couple of my more outgoing confident friends even had the same problems.I need to tell you that ""Witnessing 101"" has made it a whole lot easier for me to spread the Gospel. Mr. Baker really knows what I was up against, and the book made it easy for me to get over, around and through my roadblocks. I think the best part is where he explains what NOT to say. That has made me a lot more confident, and I think it could help any teen or young adult to follow his suggestions.

I can say that this was a great purchase! My three boys, 5 and under, love this slide. My littlest...too small to do the whole slide loves to be put half-way up...and they all love the hoop! It is an energy zapper...all they do is climb and slide! All three will have abs of steel (from wall climbing) by the end of summer too!

"Fun book of interesting questions: The title of this book is pretty explanatory. It is simply a book of questions (417 of them to be exact). There are no answers, no clues and no hints as the questions are merely designed to get people to think hypothetically about themselves, about others and about the world around them. Some of the questions are simple and fun to think about, others are intellectually and philosophically challenging.In general, most of these questions should be shared with friends/family/loved ones--that is to say that most people will probably not feel comfortable answering these questions in the presence of mere strangers. The book is a good way to learn more about other people you know and love or can be used alone to learn more about yourself and your own values.This is a valuable and simple book that is useful to have around the house and to glance at every once in a while by yourself or to pull out when engaged in thought-provoking conversation with people you know and trust.

"Always wanted these: I actually bought two sets of these and fell in love with them after having kabobs at an Indian restaurant a few months ago. I couldn't find them at any store, only the ones without a wooden handle, which I really don't get because putting kabobs on a grill gets the metal skewer all hot and very difficult to turn. The skewers are long and flat as they should be for large kabobs so expect that. These are actually perfect to make sheek kabobs with ground meat for grilling (which is the main reason why I bought them). With the flat skewers, the meat hold better and does not twirl around which is notorious with cylindrical skewers. You get a better sear and bbq on either side of the kabob with these. I threw away all my my cylindrical skewers after using these since I really have no need for them anymore.

"Unsung Heroes: We may not always hear about heroes, but we feel the impact of their contributions' and in Women of Courage Margaret Truman teaches us about some heroes you may not have even known existed. Women of Courage is about 12 different women, some famous, some not so famous, but all of these women did very courageous things in time of great danger. This book made a big impact on my life because it is about women that helped shape early America. One very defining statement that Truman makes about the women in this book is that ""...these women had neither desire nor the temperament to play the damsel in distress. They had to deal with their crises courageously for one very good reason: they could not have lived with themselves if they had behaved any other way."" (Truman, 1976) (pg 14)This book is a must read for both men and women alike that are interested in knowing the early history of this great country we call The United States of America.

It helped me understand how dominant dog training (cruelty) methods can almost cause a dog to be destroyed... because it tried top defend itself... since it could not protect itself naturally using (fight or flight) run away or flee.Meisterfeld gave me a new way to look at training and respect (holding a dog in high regard as a living creature to be worked with co-creatively) and not just through brute force.I enjoyed the book and will read the others.

"Classic Album: Radiohead's 2nd album, The Bends, is more guitar-friendly than OK Computer or Kid A. It also has some of their greatest songs. Fake Plastic Trees and High and Dry are the most well-known. However, My Iron Lung, Planet Telex, and The Bends are other solid songs. The entire album is solid -- one that can be listened to without skipping a single track. It just amazes me how this group can put out a great album like this and then follow it up with an even greater release in OK Computer. Not as innovative as OK Computer, The Bends is still a highly-recommended album and one that will stand the test of time. It is not an exaggeration to say that the top 2 albums of the '90's are OK Computer and The Bends.

"Beautiful!: I absolutely love this book. Our two year old daughter is obsessed with Tinkerbell right now, so we bought this book so our 10 year old daughter could read it to her. This gives our older daughter a chance to enjoy a Tinkerbell story without feeling like she's to old, which she's not! It gives the sisters some great bonding time. I also read this book before giving it to them, and I think it is wonderful. It really goes into Tink's personality and how she feels about her talents, her friends, etc. Even how she feels about getting mad at and leaving Peter Pan. Perfect little book. We're going to try all the books in this series now, although I expect this one will remain the favorite. After all, it does star our favorite fairy!

"Bliss of Growth: Joyce Shafer's book ""I Don't Want to be Your Guru, But I Have Something to Say,"" integrates the wisdom of sages, scientists and philosophers with clarity and creativity. She identifies complex questions and quandaries that challenge us all in everyday life, and offers aphoristic insights which at once enlighten and inspire. It was a blessing to read and re-read the book which evoked in me a deep desire to live a purposeful life and experience the bliss of growth. Living these insights can make every living moment full of meaning, gratitude and joy. The world is full of self-help books and new books are published every month but Joyce Shafer has the rare gift of distinguishing between the essential and the inessential, when it comes to conveying the precise truth about productive and purposeful life. I am glad to announce that the book is now part of the Brooklyn Public Library collection.Nomi NaeemSenior LibrarianBrooklyn Public Library,Brooklyn, New York

"The critics really missed the boat: This is simply a great musical. Memorable songs with great melodies, a funny story line and a very engaging use of the core Suess material. Over time this will become one of the classic standards despite being panned by the critics. You simply can't like musicals and not appreciate the quality of this show.

"A quick read on a par with Archer's other books: I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read. While not up there as my favorite Archer book (Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less), it had all the elements to keep me interested. With the fall of the Soviet Union, I worry that there might not be enough bad guys for today's fiction, but fear not, we learn of the Soviet mafia and one CIA agents loyalty to his president.

It is so hard to believe that Rachel was sent away from her family at the age of seven and managed to create a very, very meaningful life.

"This is a great addition to our Wooden Railway: This railroad crossing is an excellent addition to our wooden railway. It adds another dimension to our railroad by including cars and other vehicles into the play scenario. I purchased this for my 2 year old son. He has had it now for more than 60 days and he has played with it every single day. Some other reviews mentioned that the gates do not line up perfectly and that this in some way was a problem. I too noticed that the gates do not line up perfectly but it in no way hampers play or discourages or frustrates my son. It is also nice that the signals will sound when the gates are moved or anytime you like by pressing the button. Most 2 year olds just love buttons! I would not hesitate to recommend this toy as a wonderful addition to any railway set.

"Liberal Fascism: Great book- The title belies the depth of content and can put one off. This is not a conspiracy book nor does it support narrow thinking. It is a thorough review of the history of Fascism and the leaders, of this country and others, that put our liberties in peril. It is an amazing book. This book corrects and cearly identifies the common errors of our perception of history as well as the thinking and content of our current education system and our contemporary interpertation of our hisory.

It is a quick read, which also contributes to it being a good book to give to other people who aren't as likely to read the more detailed tomes that we are more likely to read as parents.

The skillet arrived the next day and was ready to go. I've used it for 1-1/2 inch pork chops on the stove top to brown and then into the 400 degree oven to bake like a roast. Delicious. Skillet was easy to clean and ready to go again. Made cornbread in it and then chicken breasts. Love it! Why did it take me so long to go back from the future.

"Good Movie, great effects, but please end the movie: This was my favorite of the three movies. The first was horrifically boring and I almost avoided any of the others because of it. Thankfully, i tried out two towers and it brought back my faith that these could be good movies. My only knock on this movie was-for the love of God, cut the last 30 minutes. It was like a relative who stays too long at a Christmas party-sure you were happy to see them earlier in the night, but now its late and its time for them to go. The last 30 minutes offered nothing except a complete waste of my time. So by averaging out the 5 stars the movie had in the first 3/4ths of the film with the 1 star for the last 30 minutes, i get a 4 star rating. I am still baffled by how this movie won best picture of the year though.

"John Oates Is Finally Recognised For His Hard Work: Frankly, it's about time that John Oates got the recognition that he so richly deserves. In regards to their 40 year plus partnership, Daryl Hall took all of the credit and got to do all the great tracks and John Oates was lucky to get whatever tracks he could get to do on every album they had released within the last 40 years or so. In short, Hall got the meaty tracks and he gave Oates the scraps..or at least that's the impression I got from Daryl Hall. But the songs in this finely crafted album by John Oates are superb and show that John Oates is every bit as talented and worthy of recognition and admiration as Daryl Hall. I wish John Oates many more years of singing and songwriting success.

"Less Liszt: Don't be misled by the title selection into presuming that this CD contains a collection of romantic compositions by Liszt or others who composed in a similar vein. At the Grave of Richard Wagner comprises two minutes and forty-seven seconds of the thirty-two minutes and twenty-eight seconds on the recording. The balance consists of Alban Berg's String Quartet, Op. 3 (19:03) and Anton Webern's Five Pieces, Op. 5 (10:38). Therfore, if twelve-tone compositions are not something for which you have a fondness, unless you have a burning desire to acquire the Liszt composition, you might want to pass on this recording.However, the Kronos Quartet is an excellent ensemble; therefore, if you appreciate the works of Berg and Webern, this recording is a worthy acquisition.

"Who needs dumbells?: THis book is for everyone who wants to get into the bes shape of their lives. I have owned this book for years and still use it during the spring and summer months.But, be warned, the routines take a long time. I divide them into daily segments and expand the weekly format into 2 or 3 weeks. Increase the reps, laps and distances slowly. Instead of running 3 miles during one week then 4 miles the next, try 3 miles, then 3.5 miles while keeping the other routines as the previous week. THe same goes with swimming.I stayed on a week routine until I can do everything I am suppose to before moving to the next week. This allows my body to adapt and improves my performance.Another tip is to cycle. Do the routines as prescribed for 4-6 weeks, then go back to week 1 or 2, then move back to the intense routines.

"Compelling and haunting but a tad overdone: I couldn't put this book down. Bena is a complex and believable character, and her psychological journey is spookily mirrored by the barren landscape and the unpredictable weather she faces in Pueblo, Colorado of the 1930s. I wonder, though, if the symbolism isn't a bit too much; in some ways, I think the book might have been stronger without the overdrawn picture of the abandoned and rotting mineral palace. Still, the author deals with many essential questions about the nature of male-female relationships and the limits on honesty in such a relationship. A great book for a book club discussion!

His style skips right along as he explains what the women did, how he got involved as their Scottish Advocate and what the international law has to say about this constant danger to humanity from nuclear weapons. Mayer is right - this is an adventure story and one which once picked up, is real hard to put down.M. J. BrewerHistory ProfessorVirginia

"Fred and Ginger, I remember you: This book is the screenplay for Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire's final Irving Berlin film musical. The premise is that Ginger Rogers is engaged to Ralph Bellamy but she keeps postponing the marriage. Mr Bellamy sends her to his good friend, Fred Astaire, who happens to be a psychiatrist. True to screwball comedies of the time, M's Rogers falls madly in love with Mr Astaire. Mr Astaire plants a post hypnotic suggestion so M's Rogers will hate him and lover her fiance, Mr Bellamy. But, of course, Mr Astaire has fallen for M's Rogers and wants to reverse the suggestion.Besides the complete screenplay, there are also many black and white photographs of the film. This is quite a good book for any Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers fans and I recommend it highly.

"why your light doesn't always turn on: I've had four of these lights. They're great. The only glitch is that if it is pitch black in the room, the light may not turn on. You just need a light source. Even the dial of a clock brought up against the bulb will kick it on. My latest purchase does not have this problem but all of the others did. Still the light is worth it because it lasts far longer than any other book light or flashlight for that matter.

Not a huge feature to miss for the price break.There are no instructions, but you'll definitely need to use the enclosed lube to make sure the wire contacts the plugs. Otherwise, it doesn't seat far enough easily.Good build quality and went on fairly easy.

"A whole new way to learn spanish!: This program takes spanish language learning software to a whole new level. Advanced spanish is an appropriate title for this program since It literally immerses you in the language with an actual spanish soap opera episode. You can practice in a number of ways, as well as take quizzes. Some of the activities include a visually based vocabulary program. In this area of the software the program shows you a still from the movie with an object circled and you name the word in spanish. Others include listening for the missing word in a conversation- harder than it sounds. You can watch the movie with and without spanish subtitles so you can follow along with the script or try to watch it without. Some minor- very minor- technical glitches not really affecting the operation of the program or use of it prevent me from giving this a full 5 stars. But a really great, well rounded buy!

"Excellent outline/introduction: If you're into naval/empire history, this book will grab hold of you and not let you put it down. Though not completely rare, serious writing on the Portuguese empire is often higher billed by the then Spanish contemporaries or simply briefly mentioned, usually in reference to slavery and disease. This work helps to not only counterbalance this tendency but to also illumine exactly what, when, and where the Portuguese were developing during the early days to the end of the empire.Very well written and very thought provoking. Again, if you're into ships, naval history, and a people who touched mostly all others, this is one serious book to consider.ALSO, I recommend Eugene Mendonsa's ""West Africa"" for a slightly more detailed description of the Portuguse presence in West Africa (1440s-1637).

"worth more than 5 stars: Lillian Beckwith has a precious talent of writing that keeps the reader flowing along. You'll laugh and delight in the eccentric denizens of the Scottish Croft people and will smile for days and years after as you recall their unusual outlook on life. Lillian Beckwith's sense of humor is contagious. If you need a lift of spirit, just hunker down with any one of her books and you won't be down for long.

"lovely film: I saw this film at the Palm Springs film festival and can't wait for it to come out in USA format so I can show it to my teenage kids. In excellent dramedy form it touches on many societal themes while portraying a couple trying to adopt a child. Some of the themes: the ambivalence that sometimes comes into major life decisions when one partner desperately wants something and the other goes along with the decision, complexity and dysfunction in families, alcoholism, romantic love, parenting, exploitation of young people, fear of the unknown, homophobia and inclusion despite the minority of homophobes, forgiveness

"What Stravecchio Grana Padano is like: For those who have not had this excellent cheese, it may be helpful to compare Stravecchio Oro del Tempo, Grana Padano, which is relatively obscure outside of Italy, with cheeses that English-speakers may have had the good fortune to try. It is a hard aged cheese, in my opinion more like Regiano Parmesan than anything made in North America. It has sort of crystalline fracture lines in it, and is quite tangy, which makes it offset fruit nicely, but as it is hard as well as tangy, it does beautifully in place of more ordinary grating cheeses such as Romano or Parmesan. Some very old cheddars are a little bit like that, but North American cheddars are never this hard and grainy. It has bursting hard crystals of lactic acid and milk sugars.

"Great Intro to art: Our 7 month old daughter loves the books in this series and gets very excited when we get ready to read them to her.

"Weller blends 3000 years of history with contemporary life.: Travelling along the GT Road is an expirience that one never forgets.The author gives an historical perspective of the points along the GT Road. He starts out in Calcutta, the city built by the Raj. Along the way he finds the foundations of the Jain and Buddhist religions. Weller writes about thses religions in an objective manner and gives a clear concise history of the religions along with their beliefs. Between these highlights he meets present day Indians. What he puts into words is what I thought but could not expess myself, both humorously and insightfully. I had lived in India for two years while serving in the Peace Corps. I felt the same frustrations he did in communicating and dealing with the bureaucracy.This is an excellent book for one intending to travel through the subcontinent or has spent some time there.

"A Definetion of a Live Album: Genesis has been around since a really long time but seen most of its best times in the 70s.... there have also been great changes in the group.... the biggest change being Peter leaving and Phil filling his shoes. This album contains most of Gabriel times songs ... of each which is a classic..(Including the great progressive piece Supers Ready ) all which are sung by Phil Collins who has done a lovely job of it too.. , the album also contains songs from Phil's First Genesis album as lead singer 'Trick of a Tail'The main contents that a live album must have are good songs ... the songs should also sound a little different from the studio versions and last but still really important , the recording quality should be good ...Seconds out has all 3 of these qualities .. which makes in One of the best live performances in progressive rock history... A must buy even if you owe all these songs on studio albums.

"Gets better every time: Wanderlust was a surprisingly hilarious movie. I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I felt it was a decent movie...if anything. The difference with this movie(as is with several others...) is the more you watch it....THE FUNNIER IT GETS.I noticed a lot of movies lately become cult favorites...BECAUSE people watch it again and again. Paul Rudd is CLASSIC in this movie and Jen Anniston...though not as great as HORRIBLE BOSSES...still puts in a good performance. I purchased this movie only because I can't stop watching it! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes hilarious dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are forced into.

"""A Bug's Life"": ""A Bug's Life"" is about an ant, named Flik, who tries to save his colony from the grasshoppers that come every year to get food from the ants. Flik accidentally knocks over the whole pile of food for the grasshoppers and they all get into deep trouble from this. He is then sent out to go and get people/other bugs to help protect the colony. Thus begins the war between the ants and the grasshoppers. This book teaches us to face our fears and stand up to whosoever may challenge us and face them with no fear. This would be for children of the grades of 1st - 3rd. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to read an adventure story.

"If all my CDs were lost, this is the one I'd buy back first: I remember listening to an earlier piece, American Fool, owned by a fellow student at college. I kinda liked it so I took the plunge of buying the 'new' album of Lonesome Jubilee. Since then I have been a Mellencamp junkee. People might think some of the lyrics are cliched, but to me it makes me think that this is a person that cares about where he is from and what he sings about & that makes the music all the more special. I simply love this album and when I play it - it reminds me of the mid 80's and makes me smile :)

"Best way to remove those tiny ants!: We were ambushed by multiple colonies of pavement ants this winter--had them coming in from several locations over the span of a few weeks, after having never had ants in the house before (been here twelve years). My brother recommended Terro, and I set up bait traps at each entry location. Wow, it was like a house ant party! Pretty soon, the ants lost interest in everything else around and concentrated on the traps. While my brother and several online reviews indicates the ants would be gone in a couple of days, I'd say for me it was more like six weeks. Maybe my colonies were just that big. However, six weeks later and the ants are totally, completely gone.Pro: works great, albeit slowlyCon: don't spill the liquid out of the bait. It's a pain to clean up. Think how much fun Karo Syrup is, and you'll have a pretty good idea.

"Interesting: P.Coelho typically says that we should always do what we want to do, even if our rationale advices otherwise. In the fifth mountain, Elijah struggles to fulfill his promise to god. In the alchemist the boy traverses the desert to find the alchemist. Here he has taken a unlikely relationship between a wannabe priest and a free spirited girl as a model for his philosophy.It is true that we should have the free will to do what we really want to do inspite of the probability of failure in our effort. A great virtue to be cultivated by everyone with a striving to grow.

"Wonderful: The only series (and particularly this first book) that has ever made me say out loud: ""what a great book"" - and not just once or twice.Sure, the main plot looks suspiciously familiar (elves, kitchen boys with a Destiny, magic swords...), but honestly: it doesn't matter! Usually it matters a lot, but here this negative aspect just gets overwhelmed by the imagination of the subplots, the richness of the world imagined by Tad Williams, and the vitality of the characters (they develop gradually according to their experiences - when was the last time that this happened in a fantasy book?)In one sentence: a wonderful ride.

"the real thing: U2 has made a lot of great music in twenty years, which makes the power and emotion of this cd all the more remarkable. ATYCLB is like a compendium of what makes this Irish band stand head and shoulders above other artists: personal lyrics set to anthemic music ringing with the clarity of Edge's guitars. In fact, the Edge's role as sonic architect of U2 is really on display here, and I now see how important his role has been all along (and I have been a fan since 1983.) ATYCLB is all that makes music so vital to life because it reflects and focuses all that makes life what it is: the expectation and loss of love ('Walk On'); the eternal promise of tomorrow ('Beautiful Day'); how painful it is to see a friend destroy himself ('Stuck in a Moment.') All I can say is that we are the better for U2 keeping on, and do yourself a favor and go see them in 2001 on tour: you'll be glad you did.

"A fascinating and often poetic interweaving....: ....of women's issues, addiction, control, and perfectionism from a Jungian-mythic standpoint. Not only enjoyable reading but packed with clinical wisdom and creative insight. Woodman has a sharp eye out for the mythic underpinnings of Western patriarchy and how its Apollonian overvaluation of mastery, domination, and efficiency has shaped the psyches of women and men. Although the case material could use some shortening, they enliven the book and keep it grounded in felt realities.

It is the perfect length for a camping axe because it fits in my plastic camping container (for car camping) but has almost the same chopping power as a regular length wooden-handled axe, probably because it has about the same weight due to the metal shaft. I like the fact that it comes with a protective leather sheath. Great product!

"Works with good mothering intuition: The books principles make sense! My son is almost 9 weeks and so happy! He's sleeping 9 hours through the night and takes 3-4 naps. Now those who follow the book 'to the T' without being flexible to your own baby's needs might find it frustrating. No book is written for a specific child, as all children are different....they're merely guides. You take what you want from them. When I read in the ratings that children are being ""abused"" or ""dehydrated"" I laugh and blame the parents. A book can't do that, parents can. I recommend parents to read this book, as well as others, to gage what works for them.

"Calculus From a Practical Point of View: I like this book because I hate limits. From a strict mathematical point of view limits are standard for explaining calculus. But from a practical point of view (physicists, engineers, economists) the notion of the infinitesimal may be the most appropriate.

A combination of these two books might make for a great introduction to practical and alternative-theoretical calculus.

"I could not put it down!: I found Mr Barnes account of his life as Thomas Andrews to be powerfully moving to me. His explanation of the ship's collision with an iceberg is very believable. As a former Navy man who was stationed on 2 LSTs and 2 Aircraft carriers I know how badly a ship can shake when the engines are reversed. It sounds like the propellers are moving marbles when that happens. Also when the ship struck the berg, it added to the stress of the ship that was already stressed due to the cavatation of the propellers, Also the brittle steel was also a contributing factor too!

"Learn about life following in ancient footsteps: After watching this movie I became very interested in discovering more about the Way of St. James. I am a Catholic and knew something about pilgrimages but I didn't realize that the old pilgrim roads were still used. Although people of all stripes walk the Camino, not all are interested in a religious experience. I have since purchased a number of books that have been written as tour guides with maps, and that have reflected the ancient ""Codex Calixtinus"" which was the original document describing the story of how the body of St James came to be interred in Spain. The ""Codex"" also describes the pilgrim road, the chuches and refugios open to pilgrims. The movie is a visual journey with characters whose stories are all different. I recommend it highly.

"bringing things to a close: The firefly series, in my opinion, is some of the best television i've seen. Unfortunately it was cancelled just as you begin to really care about the characters. I see the movie as an attempt to bring all the loose ends to a close. Another two or three tv series's would have made a better job of this, but that didn't seem to be an option. There is so much in the way of back story that was crying out to be told. A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had. I'll just have to live with not knowing the preacher's story, or the many other questions not answered. I would not recommend seeing the movie unless you've watched at least the first few episodes of firefly.

"Reality of WWI: My Grandfather was with an Artillery Battery. A lot of what he described was the same as the memoirs in this book. He had 2 vivid memories one was the constant noise of the Artillery firing 24-7, and the other was 11-11-11 1918. His description was the knew the Armistace was scheduled to take effect but they were told the firing would probably taper off and stop but instead it was like somebody flipped a switch. At the exact time suddenly there was dead silence and it was over.EB Sledge wrote With The Old Breed about the Marine Infantryman in WWII and I think this is one of a few books which does the same for WWI.

Every one of this album's slamming tunes 'practically' pulls you in,like ""Personality Crisis"", the radio friendly(?) ""Looking For A Kiss"", ""Lonely Planet Boy"" (one of my personal favorites), ""Bad Girl"", ""Pills"" and ""Jet Boy"". So glad they've recently reunited,aren't you? Highly recommended.

"Solid, concise review of an amazing city's history: If you don't have an affection for San Francisco history, you should have one after reading this short book. While I would have appreciated a few more anecdotes about San Francisco in this book, I really appreciated the breadth of history it was able to convey -- and in a reasonable length. Highly recommended.

"Pretty Good Product: I had no problems installing Jukebox 7 on a Win98SE box and performance was satisfactory. For creating MP3s of jazz and rock, Jukebox works fine and is trouble free. The only quibble I had was that there is no obvious way to generate a single MP3 file from multiple tracks (necessary when making MP3s of long classical pieces). To MusicMatch's credit, they promptly responded to my E-mail and gave me a work-around. The method is clumsy compared to my old CD Creator 4 which I eventually went back to using.

"Great CD by a great band: this band has a lot of talent......watch out for them as this year goes on.....they seem to sound the most like Staind or Nickelback to me with guitar solos and a more southern type of sound....it sounds really cool.....some are really hard like the first track Bitter Shovel and Feel This and others like Way I Am and Loose End are more mellow and relaxing...overall its an awesome CD and i highly recommend it for anybody

"Amazing book!!: As a homeschooled child, age 15, I bought this book because I am currently writing a research report on the benefits of homeschooling. As a high school homeschooler, I am often faced with the question: ""What About Socialization?"" asked repeatedly by my friends, public-schooled peers, and even members of my immediate family! When I bought this book and read it, I felt like throwing it at every person who has ever asked me that question. This is an amazing book that tackles the issue used against homeschooling and turns it into a well-researched review of what socialization truly is and how it is yet another benefit of homeschooling. So, really, even if you are just curious about this subject, BUY THIS BOOK. It is worth 120 pages of your time.

"Great little timer: I bought this timer for my kids. I home school them, so I needed a timer to time total time per subject as well as time addition/subtraction facts.

"Classic Silly Disney: This isn't a high drama or anything. It is a sequel to The Shaggy Dog. The characters are grown up and moving along in life. Anything with Tim Conway in it has to involve lots of physical gags and my daughter laughed until she cried. Adults can sit through it at least once if it has been awhile.

"A Great Review of Highschool Physics: I have to admit to having nearly failed physics in highschool on account of breaking so much lab equipment. Mr. Dennis' book was a great review of classic physics without the hazards of flying hockey pucks off the airtable(breaking the poloroid camera) or squirting latex emulsion into the microscope(permanently jamming the focusing mechanism). I would have liked a section on some of the newer ideas such as string theory and dark matter, but the book was a thoroughly enjoyable review of the Newtonian science of movement

"Pretty Nice: I recently recieved the Rio MP3 player and so far so good. The only MINOR downfalls were that the radio hardly works, but hey i didn't buy it to listen to the radio! and the earphones aren't the greatest because they start to hurt after awhile, and the case makes it kind of hard to handle the buttons and it's hard to get the MP3 player out of the case, but other than that, it's a great MP3 player for people who are buying their 1st MP3 player.Also, very very fast shipping, faster than they said it would be.

"A fantastic tale told in tremendous detail: As I always have 10 or 12 books on my night stand, I never seem to move this one off the ""in progress"" pile. H.F. Saint (who ever that is!) writes with such definition, emotion, and feeling, that I always feel I am walking along side the subject of this 1st person story. I have read this novel 6 times in the last 10 years and I always finish it with the same idea: I wish I could read it for the 1st time again!

"An excellent read!: This book is about Joshua T. Bates who spent all summer having fun...that is until Labor Day when his mom gave him the devastating news ---he had to repeat third grade !He thought his year would be terrible and that everyone would make fun of him because he flunked third grade.But his teacher cared and gave him the extra help he needed to succeed. Joshua made new friends and learned that with hard work and and practice he could make it into fourth grade where he belonged.Kids our age will like this book because it is a page turner and it teaches you that no matter how bad things may seem, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything!

"Petra Peto485: My Samsung is wall hung I didn't want any annoying cables between my DVR and DVD player to the set. I used a 6'cable in the wall between two of these, an upper and a lower Petra PET0485 Single HDMI/Component outlets. With two 3'HDMI cables to connect the lower DVR and upper set. There are four connections 1-HDMI and 3-AV cables to connect. I used quality heavy cables and due to this it can become very daunting cramming them all back into the securing ring or low voltage box. I recommend using ""old Work"" or low voltage cut in boxes they have no backs and basically grab the drywall and give you something to screw the plate onto. However care must be used installing everything back into the drywall. There is not much plastic on the Petra PET0485 Single HDMI/Component around the attaching screw that holds it onto the ring. You must use one hand to push in while screwing both top and bottom evenly until secured. Once on you will not be removing it and shouldn't break.

Yo no se si hay quien diga que este tour fue odiado o inclusive malo, pero lo que sí sé, es que en este concierto se tocan las mejores canciones de la banda. Afortunadamente el audio viene en DTS para disfrutarlo al máximo. Una compra obligada no sólo para los fans del grupo, sino también para todos aquellos que disfrutan de la música pop.No duden más, comprenlo y que viva Mexico!

"How to get more ink out of yoiur cartridge: When the pop-up says the cartridge ink is low, here's what I do. Remove the cartridge, cover the outlet for the ink and swing it in a circular motion so the the centrifugal force sends the remaining ink to the outlet. You need to cover the outlet as you swing it; otherwise ink will seep through the outlet and on to the carpet, walls, etc. (I learned that through bitter experience.) Doing this will prolong the life of the cartridge for weeks or more.

"Best Scratch Cover: I can't believe that no one has written a review for this product! My husband and I bought an end table for two dollars at an auction. I'm sure the price was because of all the scratches on the end table. My husband used this several times, and the table looks like new. When I was cleaning the living room, I used it on a low boy that we have, and now it looks great, too. We bought an antique cherry china cabinet, same thing: the scratches are gone. It polishes the wood really well. Be sure not to get it on yourself as this will stain clothes. This really is the best product I know for this sort of thing.

"Beautifully written story of changes: I read this to my three and five year old, and we all enjoyed it. People of all ages can appreciate this book though. It is a great book to show little ones the changes that occur from day to night, in yearly seasons, and changes that take place over longer periods of time. The book shows the same house in day and in night and in each season of the year and then shows the changes that take place as people trade in their horses for cars and roads are built and the city comes closer and finally all but covers the house. This book opens up discussion with little ones about several topics and can be used in teaching so many things. . . History, changes in travel over time, inventions, city vs suburban life, seasons, and the importance of preserving history or family memories. I think it's important for children to make their own observations about what takes place in the book, and I'm sure what they take from it will be different as they read it at different ages.

"Kept me entertained: I read some of the other reviews which are mostly bad. I know people want a movie that ends on a happy note or makes them feel good. But there's something to be said for enjoying a good story even when the characters are unlikeable. Unlikeable people need their stories told too.Mavis is a depressed writer who makes a trip home when she finds out her ex-boyfriend and his wife just had a baby. I enjoyed watching how far her character would go in her depravity. This is not a love story or a feel-good story but I appreciated it for what it was.

"Finally, A book that understands us: The content of this book is absolutely great. It's based on factual information and REAL college student's experiences. I read this book in about a week, but the information I got out of it will last me my life. Matthews comes from an experienced background and he knows how to communicate with college students because he can relate. He does a very nice job not vilifying the usage of alcohol and other substances. This book is very benificial and informative to me and I believe it should be strongly influenced reading in college campuses.

"Better than a therapist for my 2 year old.: This video was instrumental in getting my two year old to talk. She was born four months early and started speech therapy when she turned two. She was in therapy four months before I bought the video. Within three days of watching the video she was repeating 90% of the words. She also memorized the order of events and would make the sounds early in anticipation. Her speech therapist was floored. She said her first two words together ""on top"" within three days of listening to this video. I saw faster results from this video than four months of therapy twice a week. I am grateful for this fun video. She is almost three now and still loves to watch it.

"Wonderful Revolutionary War Novel: ""Time Enough for Drums"" was another great novel by Rinaldi - I would say her best!15-year-old Jemima Emerson is a feisty, headstrong Patriot girl during the Revolutionary War, constantly getting into trouble. She is convinced that her worst problem is her strict Loyalist tutor, John Reid. Jem hates to study under his watchful eye - after all, he is a hated Tory! But when her brother and boyfriend go off to war, and the war and everything with it comes dangerously near to her family, she learns John's secret, and his freedom is now in her hands...This was a great, exciting novel, with everything to make a well liked story - romance, adventure, intrigue, strong characters, a historical background - anyone aged 12 and up would enjoy it, I'm sure! Be sure to also read ""Cast Two Shadows"" and ""The Winter of Red Snow"", two other great Revolutionary War novels, and possibly also see the movie ""The Patriot"".

The book is filled with tips on how to flirt that add up to 101. There's little story involved. The book is good, but if you what to understand why these tips work, then I recommend that you get her previous one. It brings you more value and helps explain how they work. If you do, then you'll not need the other, there's no need to buy two of the same book.

"I couldn't find the fifth star: Well, they are sharp sort of, and they do fly out of a crossbow and they stick into stuff fairly well. The only drawbacks are that they fall apart easily and need to be glued, which will unbalance the weight and throw it off course, so they're worth the few bucks, but not for any serious shooting. But if you just want to stick some arrows in the wall, these will work just fine.

"Funny and practical!: Lanham's guide to revising prose offers any writer practical advice with humor. This can be used by beginner writers, high school level, all the way up to professional writers working on concision.

If you want to save some money, this shorter version is for you and it still offers the main points and examples from Revising Prose. I use it for myself and for my freshman college students.

"Great little coffee grinder!: I use this for grinding my coffee every morning and have never had a problem. I did want to share my secret on keeping it clean, though. I found that a cheap basting brush (or a large stiff paintbrush) does a fantastic job of brushing out all the leftover coffee dust. You can get under the blades and around the inner rim. I do this each time I use it and then about once a week I will wad up a damp paper towel and do a quick wipe down. (Always wadded to protect my fingers) Takes very little time and my fingers never come close to the sharp blades with either method. I completely recommend this!

Aside from that, the Misto is very cool and a lot better than sloshing your bottle all over the pan.

"Give Wulfgar a chance....: I am so sick of hearing ""Kill off Wulfgar."" This book has proven to me that Salvatore can write a story about a hero who is not perfect. I have loved all of his books to this date - and have read all of them.Of course none of you want to hear about Wulfgar. His character development from the start has always been very shallow. Now, finally, we have a deep personality to give to him. He has been the tag-along to Drizzt for his whole life and now we get to read stories about him and what makes him tick. As much as I love Drizzt he has not suffered near as much as Wulfgar in life. Have some sympathy for the poor guy. Salvatore - keep up the great work! Can't wait to hear more about Wulfgar!

His story of the difficulties of delivering medical care under primitive conditions is based on his personal experience. I highly recommend this novel and look for more from this author.

"Good water shoe: I use these shoes at the pool for deep water aerobics. They are exactly as described and what I wanted. They only come in full sizes. I wear a 7-1/2 shoe, so I bought an 8. I think it is a bit big, but didn't exchange them for a 7 because I was afraid that a 7 would be too small. This is one of the hazards of buying online. At a store I could have tried on a 7. Still, they do the job and the price was right.

"Do not attempt to shave your animals without this.: I shave my own cats because my cats are docile with me, but they try to kill any vet or groomer attempting to touch them. To minimize the stress on them and the emotional/physical trauma for the vets and the groomers, I shave them myself.I bought the Andis 21420 Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kit, which was fantastic, and I imagine a weebit cooler than the normal blades, but it still gets hot pretty quickly (10 minutes). Once it gets hot, you need a cooling spray like this (or at least a rubbing alcohol spray) to cool down the blades before you continue so your poor animals don't cry like you're trying to brand them.I attempted to shave them once before buying this, and immediately ordered this after that first attempt. It's a god send.

As far as I am concerned Blue is the only thread locker that should exist, nothing in this world should be permanent... except death.

"An Action Packed Plot Makes For Great Reading: The incredible writer Robert Elmer has really outdone himself on this one. The roller coaster of ups and downs provides the reader with a set of emotions different from any other book. Just when you think the plot has settled back down, it throws you right back into suspense. For example, right after they receive the phone call it seems like they're not going to the island. Then in the next chapter the reader is surprised to find them going to Bornholm. The climax and ending are so good it's very hard to put the book down.The details of the book are also superb. When they have the problem on the way back to Bornholm it's almost as if you're there. I recommend this book as well as the whole Young Underground Series to readers who love conflict and adventure.

"GREAT BOOK. FINISHED IN ONE SITTING.: This book is one of the freshest historicals I've read in a very long time. Licata takes an adventure plot and somehow manages to twist the romance through and around it in a way that she has you reading all through the night. There is great chemistry between the two lead characters, and terrific love scenes too. I think Ms. Licata is fabulous and look forward to her future books.

My favorites include the ""Curly Stomp (in B-flat)"" by Curly ""Barefoot"" Miller, ""I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water,"" and ""Saint Peter Have Mercy.""The music is tight. The feeling is genuine. These mostly unknown artists will have you clamoring for more and wondering why they didn't get wider attention.I highly recommend this CD!

"We want Amosan back!!!: This is a message I wrote to Oral-B. IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO DO THE SAME.This is not a question, this is a complaint.I discovered that Amosan was recently discontinued as all the pharmacies doesn't have any stock.While searching online for a substitute and a reason why that product was discontinued I found out that NO SUBSTITUTE EXIST and that you have discontinued it because there was no sufficient demand. Do you have sufficient demand to justify having OVER 20 MODELS OF MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH?As you might be aware Amosan sold for as much as $50 a box online after it was discontinued. People don't need Amosan every day, but when they need it, it's the only option they got.I swear I will boycott and not buy any Oral-B, Gilette or P&B; products until I receive a REASONABLE ANSWER or I see Amosan back on the shelves.

"White knuckles on the wheel...: The first Heatmiser album I had was actually Mic City Sons. Since I knew it was their last album together, I figured, this one is probably as good as it gets. I might've been wrong.If you listen to the thirty second samples of each of these songs, what's great about them might escape you. And like most of my favorite CD's, this takes a few listens to really appreciate it. But then sure enough, one day, after getting accustomed to all the songs, I was like, ""I get it!"" And now I think I like this album more than Mic City Sons.Actually they're both great albums (I've yet to still purchase Dead Air). But they're both greatin their own respects. But what I love about Cop and Speeder is how solid these rock songs are. They're catchy tunes, and it's excellent music for rolling down your windows and playing it really loud.

"""Choppers"" a cultural history: All too often motorcycle books devolve into long, boring lists of part numbers and degrees of valve timing. ""Choppers"" avoids this trap. Instead, it provides as much cultural history as it provides mechanical history, if not more. The evolution of this uniquely American form of motorcycle is presented, of course, tracing the American custom from its bobber roots through the elaborate showbikes popular today. But this terrific book also follows the evolution of the culture that spawned these oddly beautiful machines, from the dry-lakes racers who built the original bobbers to the ""Easyrider"" era long bikes that defined the hippie generation to the celebrity builders of today, people like Jesse James and Billy Lane. The book has great photos, too. This is the most entertaining motorcycle book I have read in years. Way to go Mike Seate!

"Reads like a good novel.: The two titles of this book (The Story of Energy, 1934 and The Concept of Energy Simply Explained, 1964) are accurate descriptions of its contents. Above all, it is a lucid and entertaining history of the concept of energy, accessible to all (no math required) and (I am sure) rewarding to both nave and highly sophisticated readers. Its explanation of the Carnot cycle and its narrative of Mayer's tragic life are simply delightful. It deserves to be published again, so that new generations can enjoy it. If you find it, buy it. It is a rare gem.

"Rocking the World Right: This is a band of phenomenal talent.I think this was the second CD I ever bought and I'd say it is my No.3 album of all time.This is the English band that made it, and made it big.Not only did this album go to number 2 on release,which was unheard of,but it sold over 7 million copies. Not too shabby for a bunch of guys termed as shot's in the dark and one hit wonders.This is a band I rate with Collective Soul,S.T.P. and Creed for sheer love of music and doing it right, and for staying true to themselves and going against the odds.There are so many all time greats on this CD that it's scary.Glycerine is phenomenal and Little Things is the type of song that you'll enjoy even when you're so severely hung over that you're virtually dead.It just rocks your socks off.If you can,try get your hands on the limited edition double album with the bonus tracks and live CD.Well worth the extra money as are all awesome albums.kadu81@hotmail.com

"wonderful insights into Carter, the man.: I have studied Egypt for many years and just happened upon this book. What I found inside was a completely different man than what I had expected. His love for his work, his humility in the face of great celebrity, his reverence for the dead boy king are touching and uplifting. How fortunate is history that two men such as Howard Cater and Lord Carnarvon were entrusted with this amazing discovery and how generous of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to send a photographer of Harry Burton's abilities to record all of this for us. I wish I could find a biography on Carter, for he is a complex and fascinating man.

"Amazon Kindle: The Kindle makes reading such a pleasure. I have always enjoyed reading, but this makes it much better. I often read more than one book at a time, one profesional, a personal help, and some fiction. Now I can have them all in the Kindle and do not have to cart several books around. It also means being able to read without glasses. As the day goes on, sometimes my eyes get tired and I need to put on a pair of reading glasses. Not with the Kindle, I just increase the font.Oh, and it is so much easier to travel with a Kindle instead of books. The only drawbacks I have seen are not being able to use it during take-off and landing, and not being able to share books with friends. Otherwise, I can see it becoming a Kindle world.

"Good!: I'm a student taking some graphics and animation courses. I bought this book for study of Maya since my school teach maya. Before I read the book I dont have any idea of production. But now, I got a much better idea of what happens in production. I agree that Maya is just a tool. And there are many things needed for a real work in a production environemnt. One thing about the book, I think the publisher did not do a good job by editing it. Also, whoever proofed read the book must be half asleep. This cause the book with several errors. But lucky the book is still contain good stuff. In conclusion, I recommend it to people who like to learn effects animation, especially using Maya to do effects and especially if you are student like me.

Without a lot of jargon, Dr. Pearl has written what we all know in our souls - that we are all connected and that we all have the ability to use that connection to heal. Those who have stated that there is no science to his healing are missing the point. Medicine is not a science. It is an art. Just ask any honest physician and he/she will tell you.I too have experienced increased vibration and energy in my hands. In fact, I used the energy to heal my cat who used to vomit at least twice a week (sometimes more). Since the reconnection energy, (two weeks ago) she has not spit up once!There is something to this and it is really simple and useful.Don't wait, just buy the book, read it and experience the energy for yourself.

"That battery door problem...: Just wanted to add my 2 cents worth. The image quality, ease of use and features on this camera are very, very good but not worth the original price of nearly $900. However when our company's needs grew I did think it was wise to buy a used one for under $300. Shortly thereafter BOTH cameras experienced the same broken battery cover problem described elsewhere here. A little research revealed vendors who actually sell replacement doors (but alas no instructions on how to complete what seems like a fairly tricky repair). We still use the cameras with tape and cords when possible but buyer beware!

Her song ""Miracles Happen"" shown on the soundtrack to the hit-movie The Princess Diaries, and pushed her into the public consciousness (for a brief moment, of course). MYRA is an absolutely amazing teen pop release (songs like opener ""Lie,"" ""Candy Boy"" and ballady ""Wishing on the Same Star"" all prove her vocal abilities to persuade) and Myra herself possesses some really strong and powerful vocals for such a young'n. Too bad she never got past the Radio Disney crowd, because she is a talented artist.

"Cher's contemporaries must be envious!: There are few that started when Cher did that are doing other than the ""state fair"" circuit. Cher's chameleonlike qualities have allowed her to last for over close to four decades. That's not bad for the former Cherilyn Sarkisian from El Centro, CA.To be honest, I had not paid attention to much of her work after the 80's until her ""rebirth"" with the monster smash from '99, ""Believe"". I purchased ""The Very Best of..."" in order to update my knowledge of the diva.The ""discovery"" from the album that made it worthwhile is ""One on One"" from 1996's ""It's a Man's World"". I don't know why the song didn't soar on the charts for it has one of Cher's most alluring vocals and also sports a killer musical/choral accompaniment.THAT standout, among an album of standouts, makes this a purchase that I am glad to have made.

The interaction of Mary Lou, her teacher Anne and the members of the singles continuing education class will leave you with the feeling that friends can help you overcome almost anything. And, when you learn where the title of the book comes from, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from life behind the counter at Dairy Queen to a gypsy gathering are in this book. If you like Jan Karon's Mitford books or Billie Letts' Where the Heart Is, I think you'll also enjoy spending time with Roseborough.

"Chinese Family Values Epic: In the fine tradition of Chinese movies, lost on US film-makers, is ""The Road Home."" Tender, endearing, moving, filled with hope, sorrow, and togetherness the film is crafted to depict life's passage and future. Yet, for all of this, how can you argue with the added value of China's most outstanding young female star today in Zhang Ziyi? Painstaking attention to the finest details and most poignant Mandarin Chinese dialog. Love this film forever like, those of us, who have been so deeply touched by watching it!

"Keeps baby occupied & happy!: I bought the baby's first toys for Christmas based on other customer reviews for our 2.5 month old daughter. When we received the items, my husband was skeptical and didn't think it was worth the money we paid. Boy was he wrong and both of us surprised! From the moment we took them out of the box, our daughter was excited and could not wait to get her hands on them. They are colorful and easy to grasp. She has not stopped playing with these toys. They are by far her best Christmas present. You cannot go wrong with these and are worth every penny.

"Great investment for garage surfaces.: An Amazon 5-star review in this section by D. Harris ""Mad scientist,"" June 20, 2011 - said it all.In addition, after the surface is etched. I had to allow one week for the surface to dry completely while circulating a floor fan during the 75+ degree with sunny weather. When I apply the Epoxy Paint.. I had to do so quickly - where fresh paint over the edge of paint will apply smoothly.By following D.Harris' review; the appearance is as special for occasions in using your tidy garage as a 2nd living room.

"Close to perfect: My wife and I bought this stroller after much research and searching. I like it but it is not perfect. It is a little short for tall people like my father in law and the straps to hold our son in were too short. Our son is on the bigger size 30 # and 32 inches. The storage underneath is hard to access. Otherwise we were pretty happy with its overall weight and smooth ride. Good luck with finding your stroller; you will probably buy more than one.

"Good game that hasn't really changed over the years: When the first Medal of Honor game came out on Playstation 1 several years ago, I was blown away by the intelligent enemies, great sound, great graphics, great level design, weapons, & gameplay. Now that Medal of Honor has entered the XBox world, it is still most of those things, but the developers haven't changed it. It has possibly the best sound that I've heard in games on Xbox, but the graphics are very dated for a new generation console game. They are only slightly better looking than the Playstation 1 Medal of Honor games & it looks like they're using the same graphics engine they used about 7 or 8 years ago. Also, the enemy AI doesn't seem as good as it did on Playstation 1. It's definitely not a bad game by no means, but the developers need to put a little more work into the next game to keep it up to date with other games releasing nowdays. I would give it a 3, but they added multiplayer to it over the PS2 version.

"A little different, but worth the read: This was not the typical Yolanda Joe of Bebe By Golly Wow and He Say/She Say fame, but it was a good read. Ms Joe captures corporate America as she changes venues from her relationship books. She gives us an good look at the ongoing on in what some consider the glamourous world of television newcasting. They make it look so easy on the news, but oh.. the behind the scenes action can be more exciting. I found the characters real and very interesting, and easy to relate to. Even thought there was alot of racism and sexism, I found the book easy to read and and quite interesting. Looking forward to Yolanda Joe's next change as she tackles mysteries.

"A Tapestry of Hope (Lights of Lowell Series #1): I thought A Tapestry of Hope was a very good read. I do enjoy reading about the life in the South in the early years. I don't like giving anything away so I'll just say it was very difficult putting this book down. The author kept you interested in all the characters. I can't imagine how horrible it was being a slave or servitude person. I also can't imagine living the life of the rich and being so innocent as Jasmine and thinking all lived happy healthy lives at The Willows.I'm going to be looking for other books in this series.

"Sunday in the Park with George: This DVD is like watching the musical live in person. If you love Mandy Patinkin and Berandette Peters as much as I do your heart will not be the same after experianceing their performances. If you are not familiar with the painting ""Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Le Grand Jate"" it is an exquisite giant painting all done with pointalism (using tiny dots) to create a gorgeous scene of different people at a park as a period piece. This musical depicts George Seurat's (the painter) journey to create this painting and how the people in the painting literally come to life. It's about beauty and how that beauty is transfered in the ages.

"Just ok: I have the same bag in green (with the multi-colored zipper) and although I like it and have used it a lot, I don't think it's anything really special.

Could be bigger.

"Fantastic CD: Although not as great as their groundbreaking releases ""Forever Young"" and ""Prostitute,"" ""Salvation,"" like all other Alphaville albums, only improves with age.

"THE SWINGING SIXTIES: NIGHT GAMES is a quick read (150-ish pages) but a gripping one, due to its engaging tale of sex and sin among the rich. The heroine is a 40 years old New Yorker who is looking for love in all the wrong places during the swinging sixties. The author delivers a fine grade-B offering à la Susann with enough shocking details and innuendos to satisfy any jet set frame of mind. From a male queen bee to a bunch of desperate individuals caught in their own wicked little world NIGHT GAMES stands out for its against the current plot and its very marginal climax. You'll either dig or dislike the book message, depending on your viewpoint about rose-colored endings. That said, if you ever cross this title, give it a chance and see what all the fuss is about.-----Martin Boucher

Books on CD are very entertaining for us folks on the road. I'd recommend this set to everyone! I saw the movie before I got this set which is what perked my interest in Narnia. I'm 35y/o & I loved it! I'm finishing up the last book now. I'm sad that it's ending though it's kept me entertained for over a month.

"Best of the best: I spent 2 1/2 hours carefully studying C++.NET books (and over $5 on various cakes and coffee goodies).This is my opinion and why I bought this book. I am not so concerned about NET, but these authors certainly covered C++.NET in detail. What I do want to learn is C++. I was a COBOL programmer until a recent layoff and was told that C++ is the language of the future. I tried a couple of times to learn this language, and almost resorted to taking a class at a local college. Anyway, last week was my FINAL attempt to get started on my own.I bought this book and am already in chapter 8. I have worked my way through programming examples, created a few of my own and am building confidence that I can eventually master this stuff.Now - why did I buy THIS book. First, it's over 1000 pages. Second, it has tons of programming examples. Third, it is layed out in a simple yet progressive manner, and fourth - I like Osborne books (in general).So there you have it - my opinion in a nutshell.

"Flawed but interesting: I didn't like how the story resolved itself in the end, but the cast and production were great. The dialogue was terrific. Amateurish or self-consciously neo noir? Perhaps, but it did a better job as an homage to that genre than ""Brick"" or ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang."" I didn't read the book so I am just judging the film on its own terms. I say it's worth two hours of your time and a few bucks.

"Amazing book: I started the trilogy with misgivings: the friend who recommended it said that it was ""better than narnia"", something i was very reluctant to believe. The first two books, however wonderful and breathtaking and exciting they were, failed to live up to the 'greater-than-narnia' fame. After finishing the Amber Spyglass, however, i have become a convert. This book really IS better than narnia! I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so i'll just say that i wasn't able to put this book down for more than 10 minutes. I sat up long into the night trying to finish it and, at the same time, dreading the time when there will be no more book to read. That last page, for me, was something to long for and to dread at the same time. I've heard the Amber Spyglass descibed as 'too dark, lacking a happy ending.' While i am one of the countless who wishes for happy endings (i spent the last few chapters of the book bawling), the book was the better for it-the emotion was breathtaking.

"classy looking paperweight helps with fine print: This elegantly designed magnifier looks great on a desk and is easy to spot when you're looking for it. The depth and non-occluded sides mean that plenty of ambient light gets through in every possible angle, making reading silversmith marks on jewelry or even fine print on software agreements easily readable. The heavy synthetic doesn't break when you drop it (or at least it hasn't so far), and it's not glass, so even if you did break it, it won't splinter and send dangerous shrapnel hither and yon.

"Great Bread Maker!: Very good product! The manual is easy to understand and has countless recipies for every kind of bread, dinner roll, pizza dough and what ever else might interest you. It has all the dough courses listed right on the lid so all you have to do is follow the recipe in the manual, enter the course number, select the size of the loaf and darkness, turn it on and forget about it. It's so easy that anyone can do it! The breads and pizza doughs have all been delicious. (I haven't tried any of the jam courses.) My only complaint is that there should be some sort of removable crumb tray under the cooking compartment for easy cleaning. Highly recommended product.

"Excellent Crate, but be prepared the corresponding tray stinks: My 100 pound Shepard/Akita mix quickly outgrew the crates we could find in any pet store. He could not lay down, sprawl out or even stand up in other crates. Then I found this, and I could not be more pleased with the crate. It is well made and sturdy. My dog loves to climb up the side and push with his front paws and the crate does not lean or give. It is huge inside. He can stand and sprawl out without ever touching the sides. This crate is big enough for him, my other 70 pound dog and myself to hang out it.The only downside to this crate is that the only pan I could find to fit the bottom is extremely poor quality.

""Sweet!"" I think was his exact reaction. It fits him perfectly and holds all his climbing gear. He's happy that now he won't have to borrow a haul bag anymore, because he'll have a really good one of his very own.So in essence, this haul bag made both of us very happy on Christmas morning!

"Salacious Action: For those who enjoyed ""Halfway to the Grave"" by Jeaniene Frost, this were-vamp story will peak your interest. It's is a neat version of the paranormal... and most certainly for adults only. A unique strong heroine, Riley, doesn't want to be the center of an unexpected conspiracy yet she's strong & smart and doesn't shy away from dealing with it. The story never gets boring. If it's not the unraveling conspiracy, the pangs of sexual craving and needs satisfied, and/or the action, the story is simply never boring. I disagree with those that have indicated that the characters never get to full development. The chief characters are developed well enough to avert boredom!

"Annie get your gun.: Usually, I would give the episodes five starts. I'd have to like it that much to continue to ""time shift"" by buying the downloads rather than let my schedule keep me from watching.But this series is a refreshing twist on the old spy genre. It is unfortunate that the writers are taking the show down old, well troden, and overdone mole/rogue/double plot lines and ""I'm doing this even though I've been told not to"" character exploitations.With so many aspects of espionage still unadressed, one would hope that the show will find its way back to exploring the theme of Annie's integration into that world.That said, the show continues to be engaging. Pierabo remains lovable, Gorham engaging, and we are left wondering if the two of these will ever work out their relationship, and hoping that they do. And hoping that Annie survives, and that Lena gets what should be coming to her.

"Ahead of its time: I used to work with a cool old guy. He was in his 60s. Me in my 20s. I'd bring in all my music and play it. He always said he liked it. No matter what I brought in he liked it. And of course everything reminded him of bands that already came and went 20-30 yrs prior. He'd talk alot about The Feelies. Then I bought this album. This is way ahead of its time. I love the Pixies and thought they were way ahead of their time, but this stuff is even older and is more relevant today, sound wise, then the Pixies. I really recommend this album for you collection if you like today's indie rock. Owning it makes you look cool and it is legitimately very good. - on par with Talking Heads or something.

"Isaac Hayes' superb Polydor debut now on CD.: After a somewhat successful stint on ABC Records, Isaac Hayes signed with Polydor and ""New Horizon"" was his label debut for the latter label. The big hit single ""Moonlight Lovin' (Menage A Trois)"" was an upbeat ballad that was equally good for both dancing and romancing (without actually being a ""Disco"" track per se)--the Tom Moulton-remixed version featured on this CD is quite longer than the one on the original LP. On the other hand, the stunningly-gorgeous ballad ""It's Heaven To Me"" is one of Isaac's most emotive but underrated songs. In all, ""New Horizon"" is a great late-'70s R&B album which should be in your CD collection.

"A glimpse into how the social elite inherit privilege.: This book provides an interesting glimpse into the lives of students, teachers, and administrators of elite boarding schools. It describes the costs and benefits to students (and teachers) of an elite boarding school education, and how this ""rite of passage"" encourages the idea among students that their advantages are earned. It also describes how elite students are socialized for power; and how their social contacts and schools help them gain acceptance to the best colleges and, later, into the best jobs, with the full complicity of the college admissions officers. This is an easy-to-read, well-researched, and interesting book. My only complaint is that it is too short!

"Highlander at its best: Better than any other Highlander novel, this story brought me into the fold of the Highlander series. The confusion Duncan was feeling felt so much like what was portrayed by Adrian Paul on the screen. And as a historian, I would have to congradulate the author on her research into Buddhism and Tibet. I know from experience how hard it can be to understand either topic, especially the eight-fold path.

"a magician at work: The phenomenal drummer from Hella spreads his creative mind out onto the pages of ""destroying yourself"". Telling the tale of clans meeting in a strange mythic land of Zach's own creation. Hard to comprehend at first, but after about 5-10 pages, characters and plot form out of the seemingly chaotic sentences.As for the CD, fans of Hella, as well as fans of noise/distortion or masculine drugs, will find this only a little familiar. Zach's band of friends (the holy smokes) work as a hive mind, swithing from complete chaos to almost lovely pop songs in the style of My Bloody Valentine. But don't worry, Hill's skills are still in full order (or disorder) as he lays down the backbone in his usual frantic manner.hard to find item, but very worth the search.

"Where it all began: The reason I have so much resect for this band is that even though they get slumped in with nu-metal they did this in 1994 not 2001.This is their rawest,most emotional punkiest album. Sur, ther's some ""nu"" bands that came before them (faith no more, helmet, marilyn manson, alice in chains) but these guys were still original and fresh sounding. This album showed room for improvement. They didn't really reach their full potential until Untouchables but this is still a good album. Standout tracks are: Blind, Clown, Divine, Faget, Shoots&Ladders, Predictable,and the haunting Daddy.Rock on Korn.

"Book 2 of an Excellent Kid's Series: The pesky bully from, My Teacher is an Alien, returns as the main character in the 2nd book of this well written science fiction series for kids. More mystery, more adventure and another alien.When Duncan starts the new school year at a new school, his bad reputation gets the better of him with the school authorities. When Duncan is made to participate in a science experiment, he unexpectedly becomes smarter. He also comes to realize that there is another alien around...but who is it? The Alien ends up being somebody that Duncan confides his troubles in and he is taken prisoner because of it. Susan from the previous book is also present in this story.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who read and loved My Teacher is an Alien, or anybody who likes a good science fiction story (child or adult).Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a childrens book.The Mischievous Hare

"What an awesome music!: The first song it just the prelude to an awesome experience. As the first CD Tree63, it's been a long time since I don't feel the sensation of great satisfaction when buying a CD. All the songs are amazing. King is powerful, great lyrics and music. Followed by 'Blessed Be The One', I've been listening to that song since a couple of years in the radio, I never get tired to here it. The rest of the songs are amazing. Maker Of All Things is great song also, make you really think about who we believe in. Over and Over Again and the rest are #1 Hits to me. I definitely will make Tree63 one my favorites.

"vidal sasoon 6 in 1 cord/cordless self cleaning trimmer: The product works very well once you figure out you must make short strokes to cut long hair. I think that needs to be written in the manual somewhere. The turbo button is akward however to hold down and trim at the smae time. You should think about putting a locking switch on it or changing it to a switch so the trimmer would be easier to handle. Overall the product worked really well and the hair cut turned out to be really nice.

"A dream trip. . .: Many people dream of traveling around the world, but very, very few actually do it. Sandi and her traveling companion, Jay, not only travel around the world, but they do it in their own plane. Jay is an eye surgeon who volunteers his services in the most exotic of locations. Sandi is his co-pilot who teaches computer skills to people who have never even heard of data processing. These are two people who truly make the world a better place. And through it all, Sandi was able to take meticulous notes of their trip so that she could share their journey with the rest of us in this wonderful book.This book is much more than just another travel log - it's real, true life, adventure. Sandi and Jay battle everything from bureaucratic swindlers to mechanical failures to bad weather, and the reader can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next.So get out your world atlas (you'll need it), settle down in your favorite chair, and prepare to read a story that you'll never forget.

For the Kindle 2 users connecting via AT&T in weak or no direct AT&T connection: I had a Barnes & Noble Nook for a couple of weeks and finally returned it. I live in a rural area where AT&T does not provide service but relies on partner connection which eliminates use of 3G connection.

"Ka Pow!!: That's right. This CD definitely rocks! I agree with some of the previous reviewers. Pat's last few cds have left me wanting something more--his ""all blues"" albums just didn't satisfy my musical taste. Pt Power Trio more than makes up for it. If you're looking for some hard-driven tunes, this cd will satisfy you all the way through from track 1 to track 10. My only complaint is that there are only 10 tracks--12 or 13 tracks seem to be the standard nowadays (thus my reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5). If you're a Pat Travers fan, you'll definitely not want to miss picking up this cd!!

"A Beef with Quast: I think that, on the whole, this recording is excelent. As has been previously mentioned, it is the only recording to house every note within the show, and as such is an invaluable resource to those who are : A. diehard fans or B. Performers.That said, Philip Quast cannot read a time signature, or at least struggles mightly with it on this recording. I know that others enjoy his performance, but when you are reading the score and he is a full 10 bars behind and ignoring and adding rests left right and sideways it becomes grating after a while.Anyway... great cd on the whole, but if you dig Javert, Allum is better than Mann, who beats the pants off of Quast. Liberties with time.....oh dear

"This is The One: I was rather skeptical when I bought it. I was vaguely recalling the LPs. But now I think it was a moment of grace when I made my mind to get this set. This a perfect match between a marvelous piece of sound engineering and a magical performance. The experience is overwhelming and I doubt any qualified listener can have enough of it. I listened again the other versions I have (Karajan '63, Furtwangler, Celibidache, Osawa, Scholz, Bohm, Reiner) and no one caught my ears anymore. My only frustration is that the booklet tells nothing about Masur and the orchestra. And there were so many things to tell...

You'll enjoy an all-encompassing story of a colorful man's man who was impossibly brilliant, able to read and understand countless books on a vast array of subjects from poetry to world conquest, some not even written in English. He was a President as adept at working out a settlement between men or states or countries, as he was at starting a fight, when justice and fair play would allow no other way. He brought America into a new century and turned us into a world power. The average reader will be astounded at the number of this country's greatest assets and beloved attributes that were designed and brought about by ""Theodore Rex"". If Teddy were alive today, I'd vote for him for President in an instant.

"Amazingly helpful: I've read a lot of organizational books and have typically come away with the feeling that so many organizational systems are extremely rigid and demand that you work with someone else's way of doing things.THIS SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT!I appreciated that this system works around how YOU work. It truly is one of the simplest to understand and straightforward in its approach. It can be specific and complex IF IT NEEDS TO BE, but you don't have to START with a complex system.Honestly, this is the only system I've seen where you can watch the hour video and immediately apply it.Note: I DID also purchase the book to help with those complex questions, and it was very helpful for those. But for just getting going, watch the video and be quickly equipped to get a chunk done.Highly recommended.

"nuts and bolts of salsa: Trompeta is one of the best academic studies of Afro-Cuban and salsa music in print. Following roughly in the Gunther Schuller tradition, the author does an in-depth analysis of the music and especially the trumpet style. Although the book does present a fairly thorough overview of the history of the music, it is not for the faint-hearted.Its primary strength is its exhaustive solo by solo and bar by bar study of the playing of Chappottin and Chocolate. An interesting byproduct of the book is the interview with Chocolate, which is presented in Spanish and with an English translation.If you are looking for strictly anecdotal material and an easy read, this book is not for you. However, if you want a book that presents a thorough musical presentation of this great tradition you can't do better than Trompeta

"Beau Brummels - 'Introducing The.....' (Sundazed): 'Introducing...' was the band's first lp as it USUALLY is great to always here a band's(any band's)for that matter very first effort.Originally released in 1965.Two bonus tracks are added on.It's been SO long since I've heard any music from the San Francisco five piece.Beau Brummels had managed to benefit from creating their own brand of harmless good-natured laid back pop.Heck,I think my own parents would even get something out of this reissue.The Brummels have much to offer the listener in the way of employing somewhat rich melodies and soaring harmonies in the making of their music.Key tracks include ""Laugh,Laugh"",""Just A Little"",""Oh Lonesome Me"" and the rocking ""That's If You Want Me"".Should appeal to fans of the Byrds,Lovin' Spoonful,the Monkees,Grass Roots and the Searchers.

"surprisingly good: Previously published as ""Glamoury"", this book is a surprising publication since it comes from Llywelyn (who does not have a stellar reputation in regards to scholarship). As well as lore and history, Blamires presents some wonderful visualization exercise which are downright shamanic. There is a good overview of some of the beings you may meet in the Otherworld though I feel he is too cautious in recommending that you not work with some of them (I believe you can be prepared to face anything as long as you have acquainted yourself with your own Shadow Self) . The somewhat hermetic rituals are also group focused and will take a little time for deconstruction for the dedicated solitary. However, I believe this book is an important entry into Celtic magic and shamanistic practice.

Superbly researched and ably written, Sears presents the Chancellorsville campaign through the eyes of its participants, frequently providing superior insight into ""why"" the military leaders did what they did. Sears posits that the reason Hooker and the Army of the Potomac failed to defeat Lee was more of a function of breakdown in telegraph communications and the failure of one or two Corps commanders, rather than exclusively the result of Hooker's indecisiveness at the critical moment

"Sad and beautiful: This story follows two boys and their relationships with each other and outsiders as they move from childhood into adolescence and eventually into adulthood. The story is told in alternating first person(s) through a variety of characters. While I am not generally crazy about that method of story telling, and it may not add much to the narrative in this case, the technique works reasonably well.One of the chapters (ch.3, I believe) appeared in the New Yorker some years back as a short story entitled ""White Angel."" For this chapter alone the book is worth the cover price. It is as moving as any short story I have read in years. Sadly, the book doesn't get quite that good again, but remains quite wonderfully written and entertaining (albeit quite depressing as well).Few contemporary authors write more artfully, more beautifully than Cunningham, but this cat is depressing. You wouldn't find me reading multiple works of his in succession--they're just too much to take.

"An album of emotions...: It's not easy to find an album which can awake in me all these differents kind of emotions, not easy neither find a double album which I like all the songs, the strong of a theather show, the feeling of a pure heart, the simplicity of the perfection, that's how I feel this album, but it's not easy to understand the music of Peter Hammill, so don't try if you are not a very open minded person about music.

"nice product: You wouldn't think that just a powder like this could give you coverage, but yet give you a natural glow, but this does. Must use the professional makeup brushs for applying to get the full benefit (make sure to clean them with warm water and mild soap regularly). Also, the other products are great with it: blush, bronzer, eye makeup to create the maximum overall great look. Also, the products wash off nicely, and stay on well too.

"There is no Ultimate Collection: Look, we can argue forever about what songs consitute the Ultimate Who collection (and my list alone would make up a much longer collection that this). But, the sound is excellent, the selection is pretty good...and it goes easy in my car or portable CD player, too. So, if you really would like a ""greatest"" collection of the Who and don't want to cut your own from your own CDs, you won't go wrong with this one.

"You HAVE to see this: I can't stress enough, how funny this show is. It's so well written and quick and witty. All the characters have their share of humourous scripts and they all pull it off with immaculate timing and dead pan faces. My absolute favourite is Dr Cox. He's never too shy to tell you exactly how stupid he thinks you might be and exactly what he's thinking. The back and forth bantering between the janitor and Zach Braff is hilarious. It's so sharp and clever, you really have to see for yourself this amazing show. I hope they get the Emmy's they deserve.

"Great resource for anyone fighting Cancer!: When my sister was diagnosed with [...] cancer, 5 years ago, this book was a good source of understanding and spiritual strength. Lynn Eib is a cancer survivor and she tells the stories of about 20 people who also faced cancer. As a pastor, I find that cancer brings many questions about faith, Jesus and healing. I have given away about 25 copies of this book to people in our congregation, both those with cancer and family members who also struggle with their faith in a time like this.This is a witness to the presence of God in the midst of some of the darkest time of a person's life. This book can bring hope and healing to those who read it.

"A Must See!: 9/11: Blueprint for Truth, the Architecture of Destruction (2008 Research Edition)From AE911 Truth, released in 2008, the film explores all aspects of the destruction of the Twin Towers, Building 7, in a non-partisan way. This is from a group of engineers & architects and an alternative points of view.The film takes a logical approach in viewing the inconsistencies of much of the data on the collapsing(s). It is not a ""Conspiracy Theory"" film as the film does not address who did what, which group or any such thing.The information is disputed and much has been resolved... or has it?It leaves it for you, the viewer to decide. Mr. Gage tells you right in the beginning that you should not just take the information as truth alone. It hopes that you will also read, investigate and draw your own conclusions or at least, start to question. Thermite discussed in detail. Lots of visual references (Charts) as well as video from many perspectives.Great film!

"What is tragic is absurd, what is absurd is funny: War is a summary of all possible tragic events. Here the main character, Yossarian, is someone who recognizes that absurdity has become a way of life for a world were logic reasoning has been twisted to support a group of persons who could not care less about their fellow beings.The problem for someone, as him, who suddenly becomes ""enlightened"" is that he can no longer be understood. Besides he can no longer be in communion with life as it was before. From that perspective everything that occurs becomes absurd, and what is absurd is usually funny. Here is the strength of the book, it proves that once you can laugh about the situations you are living, you are in control of your life andabove those persons who try to keep you under their grip.

I recently ate in a restaurant which had no knives to offer. I whipped this out and was cutting fish and metal tarter sauce packets open as easy as you could want. The Buck site is here.[...]

"Perennials for Intermountain and High Desert.: My husband and I are landscaping our front yard. We have lived in Reno, Nevada only 2 years and were at a loss as to what flourishes in our climate and soil.

"A good overview of ABA therapy: A very well written book which is easy to read and is good value. I would recommend it be used in conjunction with "" A Work in Progress"" by Leaf and McEachlin to understand ABA therapy for Autism. ""The ABA Program Companion"" book gives an overview of what ABA is, rather than a specific program. A ""Work in Progress"" gives a specific comprehensive program especially suited for a younger child.As a parent (and qualified school teacher), I have used the book to give my son therapy whilst waiting for Professional Services to become available and found it most useful.You may want to borrow a copy instead of buying it, if you are a parent as it mainly provides background information.

This CD is mixed in a continuous DJ mix style.A great combination of African grooves and arrangements and New York style production.

"Surprisingly good!: I have been waiting for these books to finally become available on Kindle, so was curious when I downloaded this to see if the series would be any good. I thought the beginning was a little hard to figure out who all the characters are, but as the book continued, I really liked it. I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed, but the story still kept my attention. It reads like a Sunday night PBS murder mystery show so if you like that pace, you will like this book. I'm reading the second book in the series now, but am not finding it quite as captivating.

"Good lawyer stories: This book has 7 short stories involving a father-and-son law firm in NYC. Some of them involve long courtroom scenes, while others take place in the firm's office and other locations. The author writes very well and sometimes goes into detail about law. I figured that he must have been a lawyer, so I looked him up, and he was. He likes to use subtle humor, which helps a lot in making the stories enjoyable. None of the stories are wonderful, but most are pretty good and make entertaining reading.

"Smokin': I have the Zebra print booties and they look smokin' hot. They are small/snug fit. I generally wear a 5.5 - 6 and I purchased the size 6 which felt snug when I put them on although they loosened up upon wearing. They are high so I would not recommend wearing them to walk the city but if your going out and want lots of compliments, go for it!

"A Cadillac of tapes: I know how to get good masking performance out of cheap painters tape. gently feather the edge of the tape with the slightest amount of tape and let it dry and seal the edge of the tape for a few minutes.But you still have to deal with tape that tears wrong or tends to bleed anyway; that does not stick or sticks too much.This tape is thin and adheres closely to fairly uneven surfaces. It comes off after days, even when stuck to metal. It is as good as Frog tape for preventing bleeds, but sticks better. Its thinness allows for precision.Price is a different matter. I would use this tape for difficult surfaces and situations, and use the cheap stuff elsewhere.Update: Not the purpose for which it is intended, but I used some of this tape to seal plastic sheeting against an exterior wall to protect some electric timers for the Christmas lights. A month later it peeled away smoothly in one piece from the paint having maintained a good seal and still sticky. Pretty good stuff.

"AMAZING: Ninja Gaiden is on of the best action/adventure games ever. Not to mention is has the most beautiful graphics out of any game on XBOX. When the games starts you are in about an 1800s japan era. The games then evolves into modern times which seems strange at first but eventually grows on you.There are plenty of ninja's and soldiers to fight so there is never a dull moment. The bosses can be very tough so if you don't like too much challenge this is not for you.I bought this game without knowing anything about and it was worth every penny. Highly recommended.

"This is a great iron!: I never thought that I'd spend $100 for an iron! Why should I spend a wad of cash for an appliance to do a job that I hate! I was wrong. The weight of this iron enables it to glide effortlessly across the fabric. Cottons actually press crisp and wrinkle free. I find that I don't have to use spray on ironing aids nearly as much. Because of it's superior performance I spend far less time ironing. If this one ever dies, I'd buy another in a New York minute.

"atmospheric and dark: the Cocteau Twins were still lurking around in those victorian ghost hallways on this album before they shot up to the heavenly stratosphere. the rhythms are a bit denser and the melodies are certainly darker than on later recordings. but this is a very focused effort resulting in haunting songs, creepy songs, and beautiful songs. i would recommend this album after buying ""Blue Bell Knoll"" and ""Heaven or Las Vegas.""

"Good value and durability so far.: Bought to replace a wood stand that rotted in two years. This stand spent all season in the yard and still looks great. Stainless hardware held up great so far. There was a tiny bit of rust inside the tubes when I disassembled it for the winter, but hopefully it will last a lot longer than the wood stand. Overall, it's sturdy and stable. The steel tubing is very good quality and the welds and connections are all very good as well. The main issue that I have with it is that the S-hooks tend to fall out whenever I move the stand to mow around it and also when I'm taking the hammock down, but it's only a minor inconvenience.

"Inspiring: Though this point has been time and time again, perhaps the greatest legacy that Carl Sagan left to us is how he was able to popularize science for the masses. While presenting a picture of a vast universe, one in which humanity is neither noteworthy nor the end result of the universe's creation, Sagan does not make the reader feel insignificant or forlorn. Rather, the reader is filled with a sense of awe and is inspired by the possibilities the cosmos holds for our species. It really isn't hyperbole when I claim that, for many, ""Cosmos"" is a spiritual, as well as an intellectual, journey of the imagination.

"Simple rice: I've have had an early version of this rice cooker for 15 years. But its the last 5 years that I have used it frequently.Needless to say the instructions disappeared years ago. The first I'd heard of soaking rice was recently.It makes perfect rice for me. I make brown or wild rice, even an exotic black Canadian rice. I don't soak or rinse the rice (but may start).First I coat pot with olive oil spray. Measure in my water, add measured rice, usually a 2:1 water to rice ratio. I don't use the internal markings on pot.....Putting the water in first has eliminated any burning. Making the max amount has always made a little mess. So, I'm buying a bigger size rice cooker!

"Useful for Non-Majors: I teach literature to undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, business, computer science, and nursing. Since I can't count on them having had training in writing about literature, I often assign specific sections of this text, or make it recommended reading for students with less confidence in writing about literature.My students almost universally praise this text, and I think *their* opinions, rather than those of us teachers, are the ones that really count. They find the specific, nuts-and-bolts suggestions useful, and the explanations clear and helpful.I recommend this text to any student (high school or college) who wants a concise guide to writing about literature, and any teacher or professor whose students usually lack a solid background in literary study.

"Outstanding value: I've scoured the web for quality forged knives at a good price and this is one of the best deals currently available. My buddy bought a Calphalon knife set for over $200 and when I showed him mine he nearly had a heart attack. The sharpness, heft, fit and finish are practically indistinguishable, and I got mine for $130 shipped. As is to be expected in any large numbered set, there are some redundant knives included: I see no real need for the 8"" slicer or the 5"" serrated. However, you DO want a santoku, bread knife, parer, shears and steak knives, and to accumulate these individually (with a quality wood block) would surely exceed $150 assuming forged German steel.

"Spellbinding and (I must agree) Haunting: This is traditional Swedish music stripped down to its absolutely gorgeous acoustic roots. Featuring members of Hoven Droven and Garmarna's lead vocalist, these are musicians who live very much in the 21st century. The restrained approach and the loving touch they show here makes clear how much they respect the older musical traditions. There seems to be a plethora of overly-sentimentalized acoustic traditional music out there... one is well-advised to be on guard against this. Triakel play with passion and intensity as well as reverence, bringing this music to life. They are a fantastic band live, especially in intimate venues.Using only harmonium, violin and voice, Triakel creates a musical atmosphere of remarkable depth and texture. The melodies are hauntingly beautiful. Emma Hardelin's voice is magical and really flourishes in the intimate Triakel arrangements. Highly recommended.

"Great Help: This book is great because it is tabbed for easy reference. It was a great price too. It can be carried with you anywhere. And I love that it spaces to write everything from the propasol to your wedding vows. It includes tips to save money also, without sounding like you're trying to be cheap. It has all the directions for addressing envelopes and reasons behind some old traditions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it sounds like it's almost trying to help you plan a very upscale, classy, expensive, almost unrealistic wedding at times. But otherwise it is great. I definately recommend it.

"Good, but not the best: Several years ago I bought a Felco No. 6 pruner for my wife. I decided I needed a slightly bigger pruner from myself so I recently bought the Felco No. 10. It is a good tool and very well made but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as easy to use as the No. 6. The blade is bigger so it can cut a bigger branch (up to 1"") but it also takes more hand strength, even on the smaller branches, than does the No. 6. The result is that if I'm doing extensive trimming my hand gets tired more quickly and I can't get as much trimming done. If I were going to do it again, I'd buy the smaller (No. 6) pruner.

"At the peak of their popularity: The movie Stop Making Sense was an amazing chance to see one of the most creative bands of the 80's in action. This soundtrack does a good job of capturing the sound of this event, but does not quite reproduce the power of the show as well as the concert film. The band is in fine form and David Byrne's vocals are impassioned and forceful, very different from the sterility and control found on the studio recordings. A new version is available with added tracks. Fans probably should check that out as opposed to this version.

"Rabbit trap worked!: I knew nothing about catching the rabbit in our garden, but I decided that I would give this trap a try based on the reviews that I read here. It seemed easy enough to assemble and humane for getting rid of the rabbit. When the package arrived, we assembled it without any problems. We put it out in the garden area and put some cabbage leaves and baby carrots in the trap. On the third night, we caught the rabbit! It was easy to transport and release the rabbit at a wooded area that is just a mile from the house. We have since placed the trap outside again just in case there is another rabbit in our garden, but so far, we have seen no evidence of any more rabbits. I would reccommend this trap. It is light-weight, but very sturdy, and will do the job that you need. If you were to stop me on the street, I would reccommend this trap for anyone who asks me about it.

"Healing Balm for the Soul: Rita Reynolds offers solace to anyone who has had a beloved pet and has had to face, or anticipates facing, the loss of their beloved's physical presence and companionship when the cycle of death and dying arrive. My husband and I just went through this experience with our beautiful 11 year old Golden Retriever and it was a heartwrenching experience, though it opened many avenues for emotional and spiritual growth. I had already set the intention for healing and growth for myself through this deeply painful experience when a client of mine gave me Rita's book. Her book beautifully validated in my mind what is possible when we move into the pain of loss with our beloved animal friends and use the experience to deepen our connection to life. Rita is an incredibly compassionate person and writes her beautiful story with an amazingly open and expansive heart. Thank you Rita for choosing to share your love and inspiration to support us on our journeys with our pets.

"Inspiring, uplifting and moving: This work ministered to several needs. ""The Battle Is The Lord's"" advocates putting our problems in the hands of the Lord. This selection was most inspiring and perhaps my favorite cut because I heard it at the precise moment I needed a word of encouragement from God. ""Save The World"" made me remember if I really want to minister effectively to anyone with severe physical needs, like the homeless, I must first satisfy the needs of the body if I want the individual to even consider the needs of the soul.

"I loved it!: I watched Armageddon for the very first time in my home, and I was very impressed by it. The movie combines a great cast, incredible special effects, and a good plot to form one of the best movies I've ever seen. One minute you're laughing, the next you're crying, the next you're gripping the edge of your seat. As one of my friends told me, ""I laughed, I cried, I wet myself."" One very out of line reviewer said that this was a movie only for slow-witted, below average teenagers. Well, I'm a quick-witted teenager with a 3.85 GPA, and I loved it. So did my friends, and they're not drooling morons either. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you like action, drama, romance, or comedy movies, Armageddon is your flick!

"A well written story with possible historical significance: Only research would determine if this story is factual, well created or a mixture of both. The details were handled well and I was personally drawn into the story, eagerly awaiting my next available reading time. This is clearly a story that could have been a very lengthy novel had the author chose to do so. I have recommended this to 3 others and all say they were very surprised that this was a free offering.

"Chistian Music from Skillet? Dont think so...: This CD has been labeled ""Christian Music"" so when I got it, I was extremely disappointed that very few of the songs have any Christian theme at all and alot of them are just plain angry. I do really like the CD with alot of strong songs on it (Savior, Foresaken, Open Wounds, Imperfection...) but dont like something labled ""Christian"" when it really isnt. If you are looking for uplifting lyrics, Christian themed music, with a very hard edge, go out and get Kutless instead. Kutless brings Christ in on every song and they rock hard. They walk the walk and talk the talk while Skillet just dangles on the edge...dont get me wrong, great CD with alot of good rocking songs but not alot of ""Christ"" in their music even though they give shout outs to the lord on their liner notes. Hypocritical?Christian buyer beware....

"best soultion for all-in-one remote: This device did exactly what I want: Free me up for helping everyone else in the house to figure out how to control our home entertainment system, which inlcudes a 42 inch Panasonic plasma Tv, a Panasonic PT1050 home theatre system and a Dishnetwork VIP622 DVR. Below are some of my experiences.1.Web based programing is done through USB. Programing interface is not very intuitive, youhave to play with it for a while to get the idea how everything is organized.2.Specifically for my plasma TV, I have to adjust the delay after power on longer to make the next command work correctly.3.The buttons are small compared to normal remote, it also takes some time to adjust.All in all, this is the best all-in-one remote control.

"Perfect for everything.: This is the pan I reach for every time I step in front of the stove. It's a convenient size, and the hard-anodized surface is wonderful for everything. It browns well, and I can even do eggs in it (although I hedge my bets with a small shot of PAM). It can slip right in the oven, too.The only think I don't like is that to preserve the finish (and the warranty) you can't clean it in the dishwasher. However, because of the hard-annodized surface, anything stuck to the pan comes clean by deglazing it with a swish of water. The recommended way to clean these pans is with a little Comet scouring powder and a Scotch-brite green scouring pad. Very easy, very quick.

"Stranger Than Fiction: A takeover story that reads like a Jeffrey Archer novel, Barbarians at the Gate is a meticulously detailed account of the takeover of RJR Nabisco by KKR in the late 80s. The authors were WSJ journalists who covered the story for the Journal and the book does a great job of communicating the tension and intrigue of those six weeks in 1988. The book does slack in pace at times but the story keeps you engaged. Recommended.

"War Horse: This story is fantastic. It is about a horse named Joey who gets taken away from his owner (Albert) and is sold to the military.Joey goes through hard training , battle, and losses and remained a sturdy work horse.Even though the book is told from the horse's point of view, you get a great amount of details about the people around him.There is also a big question: will Albert ever find Joey again?Through Joey we receive a message of hope and the search for peace in the midst of a battle field. ""The author"", Michael Morpurgo is superb in his historical accounts of the use of horses and the role of the cavalry during W.W.1.""I would recommend this book to people who love horses and history. Currently I am looking forward in a very near future to see the play War Horse at the Lincoln Center,New York.

This camera is like a half-SLR, you can adjust diaphragm,shutter,and white balance etc. The only problem is that if you take pic for iso over than 400, your photo will become so..""mosaic"", the quality is very unacceptable. Another point is about the color, its color is not as good as Canon's (warm tone). The picture that takes by the LX2 is more red-tone. Although you can adjust the white balance the solve the problem, it is still not as good as Canon's one. But in general, i like it! it is really a good camera :)

"Tradgedy of 'GUFFMAN' brilliant, and INCREDIBLY HILARIOUS!: Christopher Guest certainly had his mind on creating a ""Spinal Tap"" for the world of the theater when he created that humble little town of Blaine, Missourri with a heart of gold, and ordinary people in right place at the wrong time.This movie works in magic in many ways. It's filmed as a ""mock-umentary"", and the cast becomes not only hilarious, but just plain lovable. If you think about it, this is you or I trying to make something big out of something small.There's of course the tradgedy of ""GUFFMAN"" which comes with the moral of it. In our moment of triumph, when we reach that goal, all of our talents used up to the extent we are exhausted of them, anything can happen, and often does.""Guffman"" is a tribute to that spirit, the characters that are tragically flawed by it, and the total comedic stylings of Christopher Guest. A brilliant movie that will refuse to let go of your funny bone!

"Beyond Religion's Barriers: A liturgical balance of the monks life. It's like watching a silent movie yet with sounds of nature. It is the mysterious entry of man into God's dwelling place on earth; a monastery. Not for the fast paced, but more of a reflective slide-show. It tends to cause the viewer to search out their own path for serving God. I am a meditative Catholic, therefore I enjoyed the depths of music and spirituality set forth in this documentary.

"A great book on personality typology: No one has written on matters of personality typology better than James and Jung. However, one will not find a clearer presentation than the one found in the following book. The style in which we think, gain access to information, and those forces that motivate our emotions, intellect, and will are all influenced by our own personality typology. The authors in this book give a clear presentation of not only their unique theory, but also its practical implications for daily life. This book is highly recommended. You will find it an enjoyable read.

"My Dog's Absolute Favorite Toy!: I got two of these and my dog can't get enough of them! I have been mixing some canned pumpkin with some kibble and stuffing the kong then freezing it and he goes absolutely crazy over it. It is the best when I'm having a dinner or something where I want him to keep himself occupied. The best part is even after he's licked it clean he will chew and toss it around. He loves the way its bounce is so unpredictable to try to pounce on it. Although he'll chew for hours, there's no sign of wear at all. The medium size is perfect for my dachshund-lab mix (18 lbs).

"Exactly what I wanted: This series is so cute and because there's no actual 'language' spoken it doesn't matter where you're from or what language your kids speak. The claymation is very well done and the disc has great features for parents - playing all episodes (over 2 hours straight without stopping) or playing it non-stop but mixing up the episodes. Each one 5 minutes long.This *IS* a region 2 disc (Europe) so you need a region-free DVD player or one set to region 0 to play it outside of a European machine. There are plenty out there and all Philips players can have a code put in to make it region 0, you don't need to buy an advertized 'region-free' player as they are more expensive. Just google it.

"Another great upgrade by Storey's - worth the cost!: Speaking frankly, I used to smirk at the series of books titled ""Raising _______ The Modern Way.""Too few of them were useful. Belanger's Dairy Goats and Simmons's Raising Sheep were the only two exceptions. Of course, that was then, a time when books for folks returning to nature just weren't common. Now, as more books are available, it seems Storey's has decided to improve their entire line.The result is that Storey's Guides are now really excellent and provide a great deal of useful information. This is especially true with Raising Sheep.Among the numerous books for prospective sheep ranchers I choose this as the best, most complete useful book for the small farmer.

"Very good: My sister bought this (in blue) for my 7 year old for Christmas and he loves it! I think that the size and ease of use is fine. We discovered that iTunes is not compatable so we had to transfer a lot of songs to mp3 format but not a big deal if you know how to do it. Even if you aren't a techie most newer windows media players will walk you through the process of changing the format to mp3s. Which is what I did.The only design flaw that we found is at the bottom of the player. It twists off to replace the battery and the SD card, and is attached by a string, but it pops open often when changing tracks by the bottom ""ring"" or when using the ""shake"" feature. It doesn't get lost because of the string, but it slightly annoying to have to keep putting it back on.Otherwise, this is a great little player! Highly recommended for the price! My son feels very grown up now that he has his own mp3 player!Mom in the 'burgh

"One Attorney's Opinion (Not stuck anywhere, Idaho by Choice): I love literature and I read John Grisham, Louis L'Amour, Danielle Steele and many others. Though I like variety, I demand quality. I found Jacob's Blood (though simple and easy to read) intriguing and thought provoking. The book has woven into it many principles that I personally agree with. It's obvious from reading the other reviews Mangum has made at least one liberal mad. Well I say good for you Mangum Keep writing, we can't have enough reminders about good behavior and correct principles. It's not a History book, but this book should appeal to young and old alike, whom enjoy family values and love the rural settings of the eighteen hundreds. Real Quality

"A PIONEER MASTER: Man, this is pure history! Baby Dodds was one of the most creative drummers of all time, playing his press rolls with a very syncopate fills in woodblock, cowbells, tom tons and bass drum rims. As you will hear, this 1946 record have a unique and primitive drum style, lost in time. A different way to play drums never repeated again, but registered in this and other CD's from him (and as a sideman like Bechet's, Bunk Johnson's, Satchmo, King Oliver and others new orleans jazz leaders from the 20's, 30's and 40's).Great impros and 2 fantastic's solos.The second half of this CD is amazing, too!It isn't with Dodds!

Although he doesn't talk, he does display a full range of emotions and each new experience is a challenge for them both. It is a fascinating tale. Equally interesting were her descriptions of going into the jungles of Central and South America and also to Australia where so many unfortuate pet parrots originate.While at times heart-wrenching, this little book is a gem.

"My ancient Waring Juice Extractor: Straight away I should tell you that the model extractor I own (by Waring) is at least 25 years old (in a mustard colored platic casing) and it still works great! It is small, powerful, a cinch to clean, and it does the trick every time! Even when I juice spinach or parsley, I get a lot of green juice, despite the fact that its just a 'cheap old regular extractor'! My trick is this: Before putting greens in, I put a baby carrot or two in the shoot...then the greens....and then another baby carrot (or beet,etc) and then I press it down. Seems to avoid any clogging, and it works like a charm every time! Hope that helps someone who might fear that they cant juice greens in extractors?I realise that mine is not a current model, but I just had to give it some praise. =o) Hopefully Waring is still making products with the same 'commitment to quality' they did back in the USA years ago!?

CLAMP usually has a high death rate, so if you're new to Anime/Mange etc., you should start with the Animes a lot more popular in the US. Other than that, this is a great Anime/Manga to check out if you're somewhat experienced. I enjoy it, and so does my friend. We both saw the fansub, and animation-wise it was great.

"Simply amazing: My wife's hair had thinned out a lot and became very dry and brittle after the birth of our second child. Her hairstylist told her to try an organic shampoo and conditioner and she accidentally came across this product at the store. She has used it for over a year and her hair is considerably softer, lustrous and looks fuller. She leaves the conditioner in her hair for at least 2 minutes. She is extremely happy with this product and highly recommends it to anyone looking for a great product to thicken their hair.

"comedic anime full of random: When a friend fired up this anime, i was thinking it'd be a decent, not amazing, but ok fantasy realted anime. However, i was quite surprised, and humored, by its randomness and antics. If you enjoy comedy animes, then you'll probably be at least fairly ammused by this. Like many other have stated there is some frontal nudity of little fairy people(they call them elves, but whatever). The anime is of average quality for its release date, but I've seen few funnier that are this clean content wise.you may want to get your remote ready to press pause/slow to catch everything.I watched the sub only, so not sure how the dub is...

"OK phone, complicated interface: We just switched to Cingular, b/c Sprint wouldn't give us free phones for re-upping another 2 year contract. I like this phone-- it doesn't get hot like my old dinosaur did. However, the interface is a bit complicated. Why do I have to flip through so many menus to check voice mail, etc?? Also, I have yet to figure out an easy way to turn the ringer off. My old phone had a one-button solution. Guess I'll check the owner's manual.Oh, and the tip from the reviewer below about putting a password on the internet is GOLD.

"Richest Hill on Earth divulges major copper find.: The Butte, Montana mines were in full swing in the 1880s, producing large amounts of gold and silver with copper being a nasty by-product. Along came the Copper Barons and Marcus Daly decided to build his own smelter in Anaconda to save the costs of shipping the copper ore to Wales for smeltering. Several stories are intertwined throughout the book and it keeps the reader's attention. A good book, very factual, but the story ends leaving too many threads that need to be tied up. I was hoping for a sequel.

"A good product for the price.: The Lord & Hodge grommet Kit is a pretty decent set for the price. You get everything you need to set grommets, and the quality of the materials is not bad at all. The set includes 48 brass grommets, a punch, block of wood (to use the punch on) and a setting tool (similar to a dap). It takes only a couple of minutes to punch and set, and they are nicely finished when done.The punch leaves a bit to be desired, leaving holes not entirely punched, or a bit jagged, but those imperfections are covered by the grommet, so it is not a very big deal. The one other issue I had was removing the grommet from the setting tool. I needed to pry it off with a butter knife as it was pretty well stuck after hammering. It did come off, but the process was a little less than elegant. The setting tool and block are both solid and look like they will last quite a while. For $10, I think it is a reasonably well made little tool.

"Practical Forgiveness: This is one of the mosdt practical books on forgiveness I have read in 35 years in the ministry. Chapter sections include: Why People Don't Forgive, What Happens When People Don't Forgive (emphasizing how the one who does not forgive is controlled by the unreconciled person or event), Forgiveness(an empowered form of giving), What Enables Forgiveness (on releiving pain and strategizing for forgiveness), Forgivers (Jesus as a forgiver- why he forgives and what happens to those forgiven.

"Very Special Rice Noodles from La Choy: We have been cooking Asian cuisine for many years. These rice noodles are the very thin, crunchy noodles that do not detract from the stir fry ingredients by being thick and and almost taking over the dish. These noodles have been available in grocers for years but as of the past two years are slowly disappearing from the shelves. Now only the fat, thick noodles are for sale. Each can of noodles will serve two people. The noodles will keep for months and months on the shelf so don't be concerned about buying 12 cans.

"zen and the art of car repair.: This game is my top time waster, I'm really amazed at how many hours I've spent playing around with it. It's not hard, and you really only buy, restore and sell cars, plus repairing them for NPC's, but I find it very addictive. For the artistic, there is also a paint-shop to express yourself with. But the best part is on the internet.I bought this game a good while ago, but it has made a comeback in my list lately because of a number of people who have started making new cars for the game. You need access to the internet to really enjoy this game, partly because you really need to download a patch, but mainly so you can get the new cars. The game only comes with 13 cars, but you can download another 11 and there are more being made. Plus, if you are one of those brave people, you can get an editor (very hard to use) that allows you to make new cars yourself.

"THIS BOOK ROCKS: I bought this book as sort of a joke, because it sounded so typically California sufer dude. And it is, but it is also awesome. Children love the colorful pictures and rhythmic language. Adults never get tired of reading it to the kids because it is so funny. This book now forms the centerpiece of my standard baby gift for new parents (along with a beach pail, swimsuit, or other appropriately aquatic-themed item). Everyone who's received one has told me they and their children love it.

"Great Show, Stupid Company: First of all, this is a great show. But it is also a lesson in how to NOT make money. The owners of this series have decided to release season one and season three despite the fact that the most critically acclaimed part of the series was season two. They could have made so much money.The first season was good but not spectacular. The Celebrity Mole seasons were not very good at all. So, these particular DVDs are an awful way to introduce one to the series. By refusing to release the most popular season (season two), they've missed a great opportunity. Considering it was such a brief series they could have even packaged all four seasons in one product. But instead they just have encourage millions of potential buyers to look for alternatives like poor quality VHS copies (and maybe even torrents). So, if anyone has a copy of season two they want to sell, I'd like to know; neither ABC nor Eagle Vision want my money.

"Only if you are a fan of the genre: I agree with everything the other reviewers have written - this IS a classic and it DID establish many themes we would see repeated over and over in the succeeding decades. But I also agree that this is not a film a casual viewer will enjoy. It is fun for a student of the genre to see ""the very first bar fight"" but not for someone who enjoys Steven Seagal. It's fun to see ""superhuman stunts"" but they pale compared to today's Dragon/Tiger effects. And as was pointed out these are actors- you're not going to see ""real art"" such as with Bruce, Jackie, or Jet (or even Chuck). If you own lots of these movies and just love to watch them then by all means buy this one- it IS great fun to watch. I'm glad I own it.

"A great Pratchett film, and a great Blu-ray: Of the three live-action (UK Sky1 & Mob Film produced) films made of Pratchett's Discworld novels thus far (Hogfather, Colour of Magic, and this one), this is the strongest and best made. Though Hogfather has a lot a charm (and I wish was out on blu-ray), it, nevertheless, suffered from similar directing and editing problems that would sadly hurt Colour of Magic as well. But Going Postal, under a different director, seemed to me, to be wholly better made, in particular regards to timing, editing, and actors as they were placed to their roles. It was enjoyable, fun & funny, captured the book well, and more than worth it.It looks brilliant on the blu-ray, and the inlcuded features are fun too.As a passionate fan of movies, blu-rays, and Terry Pratchett, I was completely satisfied with Going Postal.

"Follow Me Boys with Fred MacMurray: I first saw this movie in Boston Massachusetts in 1966 with a couple of friends. We were still smiling when we came out of the theater. We had trekked downtown on the subway which was an adventure in itself. On the return trip we didn't watch closely to get the right train and found ourselves going the wrong way at midnight. Instead of getting off at the next stop, we rode to the end of the line and back again to save money! Follow Me Boys is the cutest movie; so well played by the characters. It is a wonderful, clean, humorous family movie that anyone any age would enjoy. We need Fred MacMurray again!

"Good Fan: Purchased this fan about three years ago and was very satisfied with it. the height is great for a bedroom because it is tall enough to feel the breeze on a high bed. Now going in its fourth year, I've noticed a slight rattle in the low setting. It seems to come and go so I will still work with it. Just seems for the amount of money spent (at the time I purchased this model for $79.99) it would be in use for many years to come. I guess things are just not made as well as they used to be. On the whole, I love the output of air and yes, it is heavy, but not so you can't place it anywhere with ease.

Supposedly, you can play a game with these sturdy, silver-dollar sized coins; I have yet to meet a kid who plays with them. These are to collect, and each coin has a very colorful transfer of a Pokemon character - my boy and I decided that the real game and challenge is to collect the whole @#!$ set, but we have also come to the realization that that last elusive coin will probably arrive in the mail from an Amazon dealer when one or both of us are living at Shady Trees Rest Home. (We have FOURTEEN of one coin!) But the coins are well made, something fun to collect and organize, and I'd give them four stars; hope this helps somebody decide if they want to give the item a try! =)

"Can use for many purposes: I bought these with the idea of cloth diapering my first child in them, however I didn't really like using them in that way. I prefer fitted cloth diapers.

"She's Still Got It!: Upon first listen, I have to admit that I thought it was a little too ""radio."" But after a few more, it really grew on me. Please ignore the critics and reviewers who say ""... as with her previous two albums, Under Rug Swept is marred by unabridged stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Her awkward syntax and distorted phrasing disorients music that's melodious and compelling."" Aaargh!!! To me, that is one of the most appealing aspects of Alanis and her music! In times when almost any other female vocalist's tunes can be mistaken for ""The Theme from Titanic"", this CD is a refreshing and much welcomed change of pace! Musically, there's not much happening. It's really the phrashing and the lyrical content that make URS a must-own!

In fact, the true terrorists bent on destroying what makes this country great are already ensconced in the White House. John Dean merely presents the facts in a very logical, easy-to-read format. I just hope more Americans will read this before it's too late!

"Much more than a translation: Tedlock's translation is far more than a translation. Because the meaning of the Popol Vuh, he tells us, is situationally dependent (i.e., is likely to change depending on the context in which the reader approaches the text), Tedlock had to receive formal training as Mayan ""daykeeper"" (shamanistic reader of the Popol Vuh) before he approached the text. The results are amazing -- a depth of commentary and a tapestry of images that will require a dozen readings before I can begin to comprehend it, but intriguing enough that I bought a copy for my wife for Christmas as well. No folklorist should be without this work.

"it's not perfect (heroine or book...): Ok, it's not perfect. There are chunks in the middle (and ending even) where the level of detail wobble and I felt like it could have done with a few more drafts. I did enjoy the diary entry style of writing, but a lot of the detail and humor found in the early entries disappear to more 'let's just sum it up and move on' entries later in the book.That said, I had a good time reading about the plus sized 39 year old widow/heroine and came to like her quite a bit. In the beginning she had me laughing out loud a few times, sadly that level of quality and comedy was not held up throughout the story. I also wish that more attention had been given to the running of a Victorian household for TV rather than between the sheets with her man.Despite my critisism (I have a lot!) the book was a dishy treat. Do I wish the author had written a better story? NO. I enjoyed the plot line. I just wish some details and scenes had been written differently.A fun read- enjoy.

"Complicated Issues in Simple Words: Should English be declared the official language of the United States? Should students be educated in their native language? For how long? Why? This balanced examination of a hot issue, originally written for young adults, can be used in college level courses in sociology, education, and politics. Providing a historical overview often missing from newspaper articles in 8 concise chapters, the book provided me with a far better understanding of the complicated politics of simply teaching English as a Second Language to immigrants. I found the complicated arguments, presented in relatively simple words, far more interesting than jargon-ladden essays usually read in university courses.

I had tried a variety of products and gadgets to solve my slug problem to no avail The beer pans was expensive, wasteful, messy and ineffective. Other snail killers were dangerous to use around my dog. I was so tired of the slugs destroying my daylilies and hostas, that I overcame my revulsion and would pick them off my hand at night. I quickly discovered that sleep would be a thing of the past if I expected to defeat the little blighters. But then I found Sluggo and my problem was solved. Apparently the slugs love this product, eat it, then can't eat anymore, and quickly die of starvation. Best of all, it's safe to use around pets and children.

"A Can't-Put-Down-Read: This is Lee Child's best thriller yet. I can't say enough good things about it. First, there's his absolutely knock-out sense of place. The heat and desolation of rural southwest Texas ripple through every page. The starkness of the terrain and outlaw mentality of the cast provide the perfect backdrop for Jack Reacher--army major-turned-drifter--to mete out his own brand of perfect justice.I love Reacher because he's clever and tough, but it's his hint of vulnerability that makes him more interesting with every book. I also loved watching Reacher maneuver around the things he wasn't good at--saddling a horse, for instance. Lee Child kept me guessing about the motives of Carmen Greer, the beautiful Latina who picks up Reacher on the highway, as well as a host of other shady characters. If you're new to the series, start with this one. It'll keep you in your seat.

"Used, Sold as New: I like the product. But beware, Amazon sells used items as new. Proof: on the CD there was a stick-it note that said CD is warped. Sure enough, the CD is warped. Someone obviously returned this item because of the warped CD and Amazon resold it to me, with the warped CD and the sticky note, as new. Further proof: the taped seal on the box was opened. Buyer beware.

"Western Traditions: Great history coffee-table book for Christmas giving! Why do you require thirteen more words--precision is beautiful in itself! Banish overstatement!

"Great toy for playing and learning: This was a gift this year for my 2 year old nephew and 3 year old niece. Although they are a year apart, they both really enjoyed playing with the food. This offers math lessons;learning fractions. My niece made sandwiches all day Christmas day for our family. She would take everyones order, watermelon? Carrot? Do you want bread, too? So cute!

"The Fallen Idol: This is really a fine film, intriguing, suspenseful at times. It is about a young boy with torn loyalties, he knows he should do the right thing and tell the truth but the man he looks up to is suspected of a terrible crime and he may hold the key to what really happened. Very engrossing and this new digital transfer is a real treat.

"A GREAT FLICK, A MUST SEE! Hatcher Rules!: This movie was a great murder movie, full of supense and great actors. Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron are excellent. The fight between the two of them is brilliant, and the climax of the movie was very exciting. James Spader was excellent in his role, and has proven to be a very versatile actor. In fact, everyone in the movie was great. Maybe they could have spent a little more time developing the characters, but it didn't really matter. Teir Hatcher And James Spader were the best. Their best films yet!

"Great book!: I went through several baby food books before finding (and loving) this one. Other books are huge with tons of info about how to feed, when to feed, nutritional analysis, etc.etc. I just wanted a book with a bunch of homemade baby food recipes categorized by age - and that's exactly what this is! It's easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to make their own baby food. Also - next to some of the recipes it gives you tips on how to make the recipe ""older child"" friendly.Only reason I didn't give it a ""perfect"" score is because I wish it had even more recipes in it - not that it doesn't have enough - I just really love it!

"Everything I hoped for and more: There is my new favorite yoga dvd! I was looking for a yoga practice that was more restorative than workout and this is it.This dvd consists of numerous sequences that address a variety of ailments and conditions. There is so much variety, both within each sequence and each pose that there is truly something for everyone. I love how 4 examples of each pose are demonstrated, from the most gentle, supported and relaxing variation to more advanced and vigorous variations. The setting is gorgeous and the music is relaxing and peaceful. Laura's voice is soothing and never intrusive.I know that this dvd will be a regular part of my yoga practice for years to come.

"Schumacher SE-4022 Review: This is a fine product for the price. The clamps are a little flimsy but nothing I can't live with or, I'll change them. The unit performs exactly as I expected. If you are looking for a heavy duty unit, more on the commercial order, you will need to step up to Schumacher's top of the line offerings. Of course, you will pay substantially more. Again, this is a fine unit for the price.

"Clear Sound!: Even though this is only a 2.1 system, the subwoofer is pure and the two front speakers are very crisp. The setup was 95% easier than i had anticipated. I'm no sound expert, but wow. I think anyone would be able to find true satisfaction with this set.The ipod-port is a pretty neat add on! All ipods and mp3 players should work since it operates thru headphone jack.4 out of 5 stars ONLY because you cant control the volume when you have headphone on. Otherwise, TOTAL SATISFACTION.

"Fun Movie: Loved this movie and especially the music. It is a fairy tale, but just believable enough to keep adult interest. Our grandchildren thought it was outstanding. I also bought the CD soundtrack. The last track is a version of La Bamba that I really liked.

"Better than I expected: Although JAK is one of my very favorite authors, I almost didn't get this book because of the reviews. However, since JAK has never let me down, I went ahead. Yes, the 2 stories are not her best, but I still found them engaging- I read the whole book in basically one sitting. They were not quite a humorous as some of her others, but they moved at a brisk pace. I found Dangerous Magic facinating as it seemed to foretell JAK's own other word stories, as well as bits and pieces of some of her other contemporary. Although Wade was unbelievably overbearing, he had a reason; and Elissa was certainly not your average, everyday woman. Affair of Honor seemed to be pretty typical - Ryder had a bit of haunting past, and Brenna certainly was dealing with her own issues. JAK's familiarity with academic environment was evident in this story. Personally, I loved the not too obvious psychological insights, the frank way the guys went after what they wanted, and how the women held their own.

"Vintage DM!: I have been a DM fan for at least 10 years, and enjoyed fully each album so far. I purchased Ultra when it came out in 1997 and quickly put it on the shelf with disappointment, expecting something more similar to ""Violator"" or ""Songs.."". In the meantime, ""Black Celebration"" became my all-time favorite DM album. I gave ""Ultra"" another listen recently, and can't stop listening to it now. Like ohters have mentionned, I too put it on Repeat and listen to it for hours... This is Vintage DM. Gahan's voice is mature, Gore's lyrics are deep, the musical instrumentation is more acoustic. Very close to the roots of ""Black Celebration"".

"If you step back for 1954 this is an outstanding movie: By now you have the story line and sorry I'll spoil part of it for you ""boy gets girl"". As some of the other reviewers stated if you switched some of the countries around this story could work today. I gave the movie a Five Star rating for a number of reasons, most are hard to explain until you see this picture, and as one other mentioned it's one of few ""war"" pictures that the whole family can watch and enjoy.

"wagon: The radio flyer wagon is great. We used it at the zoo for my 20 month old granddaughter. It is easy to pull and having the handle stay in an upright position was great. The wheels turn easily. Wish you could purchase a canopy for it. It is the 2800 model that has that ability.

"quintessential ozzy-bath: if you want an ozzy sabbath collection without any filler, this is the one to get. it is simply the cream of black sabbath during the ozzy period. every song is a killer - but i think you already know that. if you want a more extensive collection with detailed notes, photos etc look elsewhere. for me this works! i first had this on tape 15 years back and was lucky to get this on cd as well. at its price you can't get a better deal!

"A Southern Rock Classic: I recently repurchased this CD after losing my original several years ago. Though the production value isn't what I really remember, the music itself has easily stood the test of time. By far, this remains Edwin McCain's best CD, even though his bigger hits came later.The jazz influence stands out here more than on later recordings, and it's really too bad he didn't keep that element. There's also a playful element that fits perfectly with the attitude he shows on stage.If you're an Edwin fan that hasn't listened to this disc yet, it's an absolute must-have.

"Best Live Album EVER: not just the best Maiden live cd, or the best live metal performance, it's literally the best live cd ever made. it makes for an incredible greatest hits-type collection(from the time when Iron Maiden was creating the amazing legacy that made them who they are), the sound quality is perfect, there's a LOT of music on it, and it even has great artwork and a lot of tour information, including pictures, and equipment used. the only thing that would have made it better would be to have had Paul sing on songs from the first two albums.

"Right on target: This is a great product. I found it to be very easy to sight in my Wincester 1300 Ranger with these sights. I had it shooting dead on the bullseye in 7 shots. The illumination in the woods is execllent! The only warning I have is that the front sight is not the most durable and isn't likely to take a lot of abuse. Thank you Williams for finally making these kind of sights for my Winchester, I have been trying to find these for years!

"JUST MY CUP OF.........: These handy measuring cups deserve a better name than ""Odd Size,"" although that is indeed what they are. A better name is deserved because they're time saving and beautifully crafted.The cups are 3/4, 1 1/2, and 3 3/4 cups. No more using two cups when one will do. Further, they're made of stainless steel and can be used on the stove to melt chocolate or butter.The cups attach to a removable clip, and their oval shape makes it easy to pour into a narrow top container.
