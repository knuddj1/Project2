"I am so upset....I fed my baby this giving her 1 to 2 bottles in order to supplement the breast milk.  My child got ill.  She had very bad diarrhea and had blood in her stools.  Tests were taken and came back negative for salmonella and ecoli. My pediatrician had recommended I stop giving this formula because she didn't think it gave my child the nutritional value she needed so I stopped giving it to her.  She got better and recovered.  I didn't know why she got ill, now I'm wondering if it was due to this formula :(<br /><br />Breastfeeding is best, I know this, but I what formula is safe to supplement with?  We don't have many choices so I will continue to try to get my milk supply up.<br /><br />Very upset!",-1

"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",-1
"Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Chicken Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. Dumplings are more like a flour ball, no flavor. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars.",-1

I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.,-1
Although this popcorn was advertised with the Presto Poplite hot air corn popper it is too small and too light to work with this machine. It is even stated in the instructions that came with machine as not recommended type to use. Made good duck feed though.,-1
"Having brought back toasted marzipans from a recent visit to Spain which were simply delicious, I ordered these thinking what a convenient way to get more. Unfortunately, while the package arrived thoughtfully packed complete with a cooling pad and insulated thermal wrap, the marzipans were a disappointment. They were very dry, too sugary sweet and had an overly intense almond flavor, almost pungent.",-1
My 14 year old dog got food poisoning from these treats.  This Chicken jerky is made in china.  She spent two days at the vet.  Definitely buy these if you want to replace your carpet and spend hundreds of dollars to save your dog.  Oh and clean up a lot of blood and diarrhea.,-1
"Just had the vanilla and while the taste isn't horrible the contents are. 180 calories, 5 grams of fat, 10 grams of protein and 18 grams of sugar! A Milky Way bar has 81 calories, 3.1 grams of fat, 10.7 grams of sugar and .7 grams of protein. In essence this ""protein"" shake is nothing more than a high calorie candy bar in a bottle with added protein. Chew on that for a while!",-1
"If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.",-1
This product contains artificial sweeteners.  The smell when it is being cooked or even when it is still dry is overwhelmingly unpleasant and chemical-ish. The artificial sweeteners are VERY obvious in the taste. I bought to keep at work for when I forget a meal but it took me a long time to finish and I wont buy it again because of the chemical smell and taste.  Right now the empty bowl smells strongly of syrupy sweetener and that was after I dumped a tablespoon of peanut butter in it to cover it up.  I like to keep Quaker instants for hurried days but I will not buy this line again.  It just tastes and smells... odd.,-1
One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.,-1
"This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.",-1

"I bought 2 boxes of these at the same time thinking I was getting a better deal than buying from the gas station. The first few I ate I didn't have any problems with.

"I received these cheeses in reasonably good<br />wrapping. However, they were dried out and cracked,<br />smelt strongly of ammonia, and appeared<br />to have mold on the rind.

"Not much to say here. Literally a cardboard ""shipping"" box filled with k-cups. Looked like somebody just grabbed a handful and just threw them in a box and sent them off. This may not bother some but to me this is poor presentation. I would have expected something similar to what you find in stores. An individual ""manufacturer's"" type boxing sent in a shipping box. Frankly, I worried about the integrity of the product. How would I know who or where this product came from. For all I know someone picked them from a ""refused"" batch and simply threw them in a box and called it good. Additionally, upon further inspection the k-cups looked a little dirty. It appeared that they had collected dust. Not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product. I guess that's about it. I can't really speak to the actual coffee itself since I didn't try it.<br /><br />I should be fair and say, upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that I dispose of the product since it's a non-returnable item. I will be tossing this.",-1
I bought one single banana bread bar to taste before ordering. It was absolutely disgusting- bitter without a hint of banana. I couldn't even swallow a small bite. Very disappointing.,-1

"I edited this review in October 2012, after my machine broke.<br /><br />I bought the Saeco Vienna Plus 21 months ago to replace a much-loved and much-used Solis Master 5000. My understanding was that the Vienna Plus had basically the same internal components as my old Solis. I got over 8000 coffees out of the old Solis over the course of 8 years, before its boiler gave out. (The Solis had a digital coffee counter). I loved the Solis.<br /><br />The machine had some minor problems, for example, it seems to leak water into the drip tray (I read somewhere that's a feature, not a bug), a plastic knob broke (fixed with glue), and the dosage dials stopped adjusting. A few weeks ago, however, the machine began to smell like burnt machine gears, and as it worsened, the stench now contaminates the coffee. The cost for repair would be $150 labor, plus $225 for a new grinder ($350 total). Less for a used grinder. I'm 9 months out of the 12-month warranty. We make an average of 3 espressos daily.<br /><br />I would *not* have bought this machine had I known the experience I would have. I have lowered by rating from 5 stars, to 1 star. I agree with the sentiment of some other reviewers that this superautomatic machine makes most sense if you don't expect longevity. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.<br /><br />Another point of interest, if you follow the Solis/Saeco product line, is that there is no water-level detector. The machine just runs, and if the water runs out, it times out (it does not overheat). You just refill the water tank, re-prime (e.g., run the water wand for a few seconds) and make the coffee again.<br /><br />I'm replacing it with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S51RQG"">Breville Barista Express BES860XL Machine with Grinder</a>, which requires an extra step when making an espresso, but after watching several videos, I think the BES860XL will taste much better, and be a convenient part of my morning espresso.",-1
"My Chihuahua, Chiquita, loved those Hartz chicken chews and it never occurred to me that she would one day die as a result of eating those chicken chews.  I used to give her those chews a few times a week throughout her entire life, then one day when she was 15 years old she got real sick right after I had given her one of those chicken chews, and she was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and they said she had developed Kidney Failure.  That was the beginning of the end for her.  The results were from the Hartz chicken chew that I had given her...and it was Melamine Poisoning.  In back of the Hartz package it says, ""Made in China.""  If you are reading this, you may want to read the following website from the FDA:<br />[...]<br />Chiquita died from Kidney Failure, and all it took was one Hartz chicken chew that had Melamine to destroy her kidneys...and it came from China.  (I trusted the Hartz product that I bought, and Chiquita trusted me.)",-1
"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",-1
"Only if you can stomach a raw smelly fish smell when you open the package and the rubbery noodle texture that doesn't go away with chewing should you order these.  I made the mistake of ordering 10 and threw most away after trying to do something with them twice.  These noodles were like eating rubber bands -- NASTY and look like clear tapeworms.  I tried cutting them, only could stomach them if I cut them in tiny pieces and didn't chew after smothering them in Ragu.  NOT GOOD - I threw that meal out.  I'd steer clear, goes to show if something looks to good to be true - a no calorie no carb noodle  it is too good to be true.... These are also not worth the price.  If you do decide to order the noodle, there are also much less versions than the ""Miracle Noodle"" on amazon.com.  Order one package for trying - not a lot.",-1
"I got hooked on coconut water while traveling in the Philippines. Since then I've been trying to find a packaged product that tastes like the real deal. There are a few decent brands out there.

I have had sugar free products containing Sugar Alcohol in the past, so I did not expect this product to effect me the way that it did.  The taste is great but the side effects are terrible.  About two hours after eating the recommended serving size I began having severe stomach cramps, as if I had taken a laxative.  Not too long after the cramps began I had to literally run to the restroom.  I thought that one trip to the restroom would have sufficed and proceeded to go to the gym...BIG MISTAKE!!!

In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]",-1

My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch.

"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.",-1

When I saw on its page that it was claiming to be ""bold"" and an ""espresso-style coffee drink with a touch of sweetness"" at only 45 calories?  Well sign me up!  I figured worse case scenario well I'd dump it into a cup o' milk.  How wrong I was.  It was just bitter and nasty and wrong.  I never did figure out if it was the coffee itself or that ""touch of sweetness""  but something in this tiny little can was not right and no amount of milk made it right.

I did indeed get 91 assorted coffees and what might be a limited edition print but the packaging was atrocious.  The box was a plain cardboard box & it looked like they had just dumped all the coffee from damaged boxes into a bin and had counted out 91 k-cups into the first box they had found handy. (At least the selection seemed extensive.)  The tube with the print was so stiff that I couldn't get the print out. Since this was the last one in this shipment I sincerely hope that there was a shipping accident at the vendor's and they chose to send something rather than cancel an order and the one that I ordered as a gift went out in a proper box.,-1

It arrived and it was a complete disaster.  My friend and I tried some (thank goodness) before the event and it was horrible.  I am not sure what they did to this poor fish, but what ever it was should be illegal.  There was a definite overwhelming after taste that took four brushings and a half a bottle of Listerine to somewhat erase.  It had sort of a chemical flavor to it.  The fish was very poorly prepared and had the consistency of mush smothering corn husks.  I fed a portion to the five feral cats that live on our street and they would have nothing to do with it either.

"Our 5 year old (healthy) pomeranian took these, although I could tell they were not his favorite treats, and ate them over a period of about a month.  I began to notice that his gums began to be sore, and he was having tenderness in his mouth.  I took him to our vet to have his teeth checked, and discovered that several of his teeth had become loose, and he had to have two of the front bottom ones extracted, and 5 more molars extracted.  A third (front tooth) is just hanging there tonight. The vet told me that several more were loose, and he could have pulled more.  I am heart sick that I fed these to my pomeranian....hindsight being what it is, they are way to hard for his little mouth and his teeth.  I thought I was HELPING him by giving him ""Denta Shield"" and instead he lost several of his teeth!  The small ones (for dogs up to 15 pounds) seemed OK for our bigger golden retriever, but are way to hard and thick for a small dog.  :(",-1

I don't know how fresh or new these k-cups are and I am afraid to use them. Apparently, these were someone's leftovers that they are trying to dump on unsuspecting customers.

"I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.",-1
The package arrived promptly but had a very large tear in the packaging. It made a mess all over my floor. Be weary if you buy this. I won't eat opened food that is shipped to me.,-1
"I bought these crackers and I did not find anything ""natural"" about them. What is ""natural"" about ""enriched unbleached flour""? Some manufacturers think we the buyers are too ignorant to tell the difference. When I read the list of ingredients (that the manufacturers conveniently hide from the online buyer) I was appalled. I will never buy these UNnatural, WHITE flour crackers with a little amoung of added vitamins of those that were removed when the flour was refined. On top of the poor quality and the misleading information provided, 70% of them were smashed to pieces. If you are really looking for natural, healthy crackers, look somewhere else.",-1
"I took a chance after reading very mixed reviews, and I do not even want to give one star.  My package arrived on time, and was very nicely put together, however the contents were very disappointing.  I expected the 35 K-Cups that I paid for, and only received 21; 15 tea, 4 decaf coffees, and one regular coffee.  Do NOT order from this company, believe the reviews and spend your money elsewhere.",-1
Returning it. Thought FL natural was made in the USA. Says made in China and these taste STALE. There is also a different language on the front and on the back maybe Arabic not sure but if i can only read half the box im not eating it.,-1
"This flour stinks of Garbanzo beans, and I like Garbanzo beans on any other occasion, but for some reason the smell is so strong when ground, I have learned to read the labels of GF products and if beans are the first ingredient I will not but it.  My guess is some people are more sensitive to it then others, it almost makes me gag when the flour is wet.  I do have friends who don't mind it or don't notice it, but me and my non Celiac boyfriend think it's nasty.  Since we love to bake, I have found that equal parts white rice flour and Tapioca flour with a teaspoon of xanthem gum work great in place of flour.",-1
"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater.",-1
"I must admit that I did not taste the cookies, so they may have been fantastic.  However, I purchased this item for a gift and when it arrived in a plain white pastry box sealed with Saran wrap...  I was disappointed from the start.  When I peeked inside to see if the cookies were individually wrapped, dry crumbs leaked out of the sides from the unwrapped cookies on the interior.  I won't purchase this product or any other from this seller again.",-1
"I love Chai Tea, so when my husband bought me a Keurig for Christmas, he also bought a box of this stuff.  I'm grateful that he also bought some coffees, because this Chai is terrible.  The spices are overwhelming, and upon my initial tasting, I thought my cup must still have some dish soap in it.  I poured that cup out and started over, but with no better results. I finally realized the strange taste was probably due to the sucralose and whatever combination of spices.  But the taste is not just a little odd, it is really undrinkable.",-1
"I started to give these RED --- did I mention that they're RED? ---<br />pistacios four (instead of five) stars BECAUSE they are RED... then,<br />it dawned on me: RED!?<br />I've not seen any RED pistacios since the 1950's. The only people<br />that prefer those RED, food dyed, nuts are nostalgic seniors that ac-<br />tually LIKE to see RED... and,<br />the -- horrible -- RED, food-dyed, f-i-n-g-e-r-s.<br />Imagine -- and I LOVE natural-colored pistachos -- someone with<br />pistacios in between their teeth.. with tiny -- fake -- RED particles!<br /><br />Er, knowing how UN-popular the colored ones are makes me wonder HOW<br />old they are. I'm 63. I'd guess these RED ones are about fifty! I'm<br />thinking they are left over from a W.T.GRANT'S warehouse shipment that<br />was lost at sea... from Turkey...<br /><br />Great pistacios -- from Turkey -- if they AREN'T red!<br /><br />Taking Wal*Mart into consideration, factoring in shipping, NORMAL-color-<br />red pistacios shouldn't cost more tha $8-a-pound, max, unless you're run-<br />ning for President or somethin'.<br /><br />I'll pass!<br /><br />RED ones should be half-price because who the hell wants RED fingers...<br />The Devil!",-1
"I have not been diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I have a Wheat allergy, which means my reaction starts immediately after wheat hits my stomach. But my diet is still a Celiac diet anyways. I am also allergic to eggs and lactose intolerant. This Chex Honey Nut claims to have NONE of the above, so I was really excited to check it out!<br />It tasted great! I couldn't believe I was eating something Gluten-free, egg-free, milk-free with GREAT texture and taste. Remarkable. Until I started eating more. I usually eat very little cereal as a defense mechanism I learned as a child (milk + wheat = bad combination for me). Since I liked this cereal, I started eating more, like an actual human being.<br />Alas, my happiness was not meant to last. I started getting stomach aches, really bad ones, the type I get if I stuff my face FULL of WHOLE WHEAT. I can eat pizza till I faint and I still won't feel this bad. And bad, bad, headaches. I don't understand it at all. I know if I eat a lot of oatmeal (serving size) I feel sick also, but this doesn't compare. I don't know if it's the artificial coloring, flavors, oatmeal and traces of wheat, BHT or WHAT. It's just a bad combo. I've read from other people that all the other Chex Gluten-Free can have similar effects on some people. I also read Chex Gluten-Free tests POSITIVE FOR GLUTEN on the EZ Gluten Test Strip. Pretty bad for a cereal that claims to be gluten free. :/<br />I give it a star because even though it tastes great, I don't like to be blindsided by wheat. I rather eat a pizza.",-1
"This is the worst tasting cola I've ever tried. It has a horrible after-taste that is completly unacceptable. I'm now stuck with a very exspensive machine, that I can make carbonated water with, and replacing the carbonator is around $80.00. Bad purchase.",-1
"This price (nearly $22/3 lb bag) is fully $9 more than Amazon was charging for the same thing two months ago.  I can buy it locally through PetSmart or Petco for about $16/bag--of course, with no need to pay shipping charges.<br /><br />Amazon has gone crazy with the price increase on this product.  I'll be back when the price is competitive.",-1
"They have a odd bitter taste and are way to large. I have tried several different ways of cooking them, but all my receipes end up with that same odd, bitter taste.  Would not recommend.",-1
"I purchased this tea because it was on sale for less than the Ito En Teas Tea that I usually buy. It totally lacked any hint of jasmine flavor, or for that matter, tea, and had an unpleasant chemical after-taste. Take my advice, and either brew your own or spring for the few extra dollars for Ito En.",-1
"I don't usually write reviews, but was compelled to advise everyone. I have purchased two different flavors. The first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released. There were about 10 k-cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere. To Amazon's credit they issued a refund. The second box was delivered with no damage to the k-cups. So I have brewed about 20 of the k-cups and around 50-60% of them are faulty. I never have had this issue with other brands. Either I get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle, when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup, coffee maker or counter. I then have to discard that cup and brew another, such a waste.<br /><br />I do think the coffee is great and flavorful. I would purchase again if they would fix the issues with the k-cups. Until then I can not recommend anyone purchase this product.",-1
"THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!<br /><br />I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?",-1
An organic product in a plastic bottle and be aware that the ingredient list now shows water so the product is diluted!,-1
"I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.",-1

"Lasted maybe 5 minutes before my 10 pound poodle puppy popped the cap off and tried to swallow the thing whole.

"POISON ""Chlorhexidine"" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, ""Chlorhexidine"" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  ""Chlorhexidine"" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their ""vet/doctor"" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that ""serious"" problems may occur, especially if your dog ""licks"" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; ""conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose"" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same ""intellectual scientists"" who've managed to put half our nation on ""safe for you"" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, ""prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration,"" leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay.""<br />Japan stopped using ""Chlorhexidine"" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats ""grooming"" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? ""And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?"" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc.",-1

"I bought this product based on the reviews. I usually drink Twinnings Spiced Chai but I wanted to try something that was more convenient than hot tea. I got it in the mail today and tried it as an ""iced tea,"" not good at all. It didn't mix well and mostly tasted like milky water. So I added a little more with little difference. It's a couple hours later and I'm drinking the hot version as I'm writing this review and I still don't like it. Plus the smell isn't very appealing to me. I had to use 6 tablespoons in order to taste the flavor. I don't know about the other reviewers, but I personally won't be buying this again.

Shipped in a timely manner....but not the product pictured or described. I ordered the original React gum and specified NOT REACT 2....because I could pick that up just about anywhere.

"I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.",-1
"I love coconut water and it is pretty expensive, so I took a chance figuring the acai pomegranet might be pretty good. It is not. It tastes like some kind of yucky medicine you had to take as a child. I could not even choke down a second sip.",-1

Also the cans were dented.",-1

"I tried Fondarific because the reviews all seemed pretty good - i.e. SUPPPOSEDLY tastes good, easy to work with, doesn't dry out, etc.<br /><br />1. I use a Sweetwise mat to roll out my fondant in most cases. Fondarific stuck to the mat. We're talking disaster. Thankfully I was able to repair the bulk of the problems (and there were TONS of them)with shortening. Either way, the finish wasn't as clean as I would have liked...something that's NEVER been a problem with Satin Ice, Chocopan or my MMF.<br />2. I was expecting awesome taste, but this tasted like wax, Wilton, and Chocopan mixed together. Thankfully the slight Chocopan taste saved it taste wise, but this stuff doesn't hold a candle to Satin Ice in the taste department. My kids, who like MMF and Satin Ice, HATE - and I mean HATED - Fondarific.<br />3. I had some smaller accents to cover, so I rolled out the Fondarific in the traditional way...i.e. no mat. The stuff was sooooooo sticky and by the time I got enough powdered sugar down to keep this stuff from sticking- it was dried out to the point where it was almost useless. Sure, there was no elephant skin, but it felt more like gumpaste that had started to harden.<br />4. The texture after being rolled onto the cake was off. I always hear about people saying they don't like how fondant feels in their mouth, but my MMF and Satin Ice had changed my friends' and family members' opinions. Sadly- Fondarific even had me gagging and peeling the fondant off my slice.<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I will NEVER use this again. Thankfully I was able to save the cake and it still came out looking good, but it was a struggle every step of the way.",-1
"I am a  big fan of carbonated soft drinks and juice drinks. So while I strongly disliked the Switch Black Cherry flavor, I wanted to keep an open mind to Switch Kiwi Berry. While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth. I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so-called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term -- Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety -- i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program). If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!",-1
"I would have expected more from Cytomax. I was looking for a drink I could use while running and this failed horribly.

Don't waste your money, stick to water and gel packs.",-1
We thought we were buying Donckel Belgian Truffles and instead we got Truffettes de France which are not nearly as good. The truffettes have 5 mg of cholestrol while the Donckels have none.  The Donckels have a very light texture and melt in your mouth while the Truffettes are heavy more like a fudge than a truffle.  I believe that the Truffettes manufacturer is preying on buyers like me by closely imitating their packaging. WE thought we were buying one product and got something else.  The products are not even close inflavor or texture.,-1

"Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!",-1
I did a search for low carb foods and this was one of the items that popped up! Hooray! The carb content isn't listed but I figured that Amazon wouldn't lead me in the wrong direction. WRONG!

I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds.  I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it.  The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.

"While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets, this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment. The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter (read Unhealthy), then requires cooking in a water bath (dish within a dish of water), requires glass square dishes, and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust. The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying, being thin like the height of bread, poorly textured, and poor mouth feel product.

"I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.",-1
"Doesn't matter how good it is for your cat, if Wellness can't make the taste appealing enough for cats to try it!  I have two adult cats, one very picky and one that eats everything put in front of him. Neither one would touch this very expensive dry food.

Two thumbs up for the peppered jerky, in fact they don't even tast like they were made from the same company. I will make sure to always only buy peppered.",-1
"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!",-1

When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic.  Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as ""black truffle aroma"".  Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil.  There are no truffles used in manufacture.  I am not an expert on what is ""organic"", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem ""organic"" to me.  Buyer beware!",-1

I tried several different kinds of bread before my colleague told me I absolutely HAD to try Udi's bread. So off I went to whole foods to spend nearly $8 on a loaf of bread. I was so excited to try it, but I was extremely let down. First, the pieces of bread are roughly the size of children's plastic play food. They are ridiculously tiny! Second, the slices, even after they are heated/thawed, have the feel and taste of styrofoam. It's  very bland (in my opinion) and the texture is just revolting. I am dying for a squishy piece of bread that is large enough for an actual sandwich. I will absolutely keep searching though, because I believe there has got to be something better out there.",-1

"I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price.

I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful!<br /><br />Then I opened this product. The nuts looked the same, actually were a bit more cleaned than the other company's. However, there was no flavor to them. I couldn't understand what was wrong. I kept tasking them trying to figure out the difference and then I started finding STALE NUTS in this product. Unfortunately, I opened the both packages (not at the same time) and emptied them into a special canister where I keep the nuts. So, I can't return them. What a waste! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. I thought maybe I have gotten one bad package. But the second package was just as bad. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled.

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",-1

"I second the review that I just read -- I just checked my recent sales slip from Trader Joe's, which indicated a price of $3.29 per carton for the 64-oz size,or just over $26 for 8 cartons. Even Wholefoods doesn't charge as much as the on-line company.",-1

"Picture a straight stick, lopped off at the top, with a few bare branches a few tiny bits of green, and you have this ""bonsai"" plant. Very well packed, but pathetic when unpacked, the only resemblance to the photos on the Amazon page would be the pot, which is identical. We received this as sympathy gift after death in family. Hard to imagine a more absurd item. Noted this to the sender, who apparently complained and got a second sent, very similar to the first. Deceptive photo, this item needs a strong disclaimer against use as a gift.",-1
Am I the only one with dogs that have sense enough to know these are not a natural source of food? I mean don not get me wrong dogs have been known to eat or chew on anything from your mother-in-laws umbrella to your hundred dollar remote. But please....my dogs will not even get within 10 feet of these. Seriously! They run & hide. And I have both large outside and small inside breeds. My dogs act as if it will bite them and they get anxious & nervous if I toss one there way. They jump at the smallest noise then. What gives?,-1
"The first time I tasted these crackers, I thought to myself ""Are you kidding Earth's Best?""  Really EB should know better.  220 mg of Sodium in a single serving of 20 g.  Save your developing baby's kidneys and buy low sodium Ritz crackers which has 30 mg in 16 g (I know it's not organic).  I would never each these crackers because they are too salty for my tastes.",-1

"The LorAnn pistachio flavoring oil was purchased for baking cakes and making frostings. There is a scant semblance of pistachio in this product and adding more than a few drops completely transforms quality ingredients into noxious, bitter, chemical-tasting trash. I believe these products were originally intended for making candy and may very well still be suitable for such things. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR BAKING.<br /><br />On a side, there are many LorAnn oils that have worked for me very well in baking (some of the berry flavors are excellent). I'm somewhat ambivalent about the flavors which are supposed to be rich or nutty such as their hazelnut or chocolate oils. I'm not dissuaded from buying LorAnn oils but I will certainly avoid purchasing 4 bottles prior to testing out a flavor.<br /><br />Happy cooking!",-1
We bought this right before Christmas for my daughter who is 4 who has Celiac.  I must say that they were the worst gluten free cookie we have ever made.  There are some out there there are much better these were very chalk like and brittle and they left a terrible after taste! Definitely not a good buy!,-1
"My wife wanted me to bake her birthday cake this year.  I've done it successfully before.  The cake was moist and yet had a delicate texture.  The problem was the taste.  It wasn't sweet and it didn't taste like chocolate at all.  My wife looked at me and said, ""does the cake taste funny to you"".  No one came back for seconds and it's the first time I threw a cake out.  I won't try this again--unfortunately I have one box left.  I'd give it to the Food Bank if I thought I was doing them a favor.",-1

Do not waste your money on these they taste like dirt, really they taste like they were never washed or cleaned what so ever, also the spices used are just terrible.  Lots of better pickles can be found just stay away from this brand.",-1
"I really hesitate to leave a negative review since we love the chips, but both of the last 2 shipments were destroyed.  Both boxes were marked ""received in damaged condition"" - from the shipper.

"not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.",-1
"based on reviews and ingredients ordered this food to change out with wellness food, my 9 yr old cat developed stones in his bladder. he underwent surgery this past Tuesday. It will be a long touph recovery for him.  he never had this problem until I mixed this food into his diet.  it could be a coincidence but I think it is strange this happened about 1 month after starting this food. His stones have been sent to the lab to see what caused them from his diet.  Anyhow the food does look good, just might not have worked for my little guy.",-1

"Shipment arrived promptly, but every can (12 in total) were damaged (some nearly crushed). I'm certain this wasn't the shipper because the box arrived fine and in tact, but whoever packaged the items in the warehouse was careless. Cans were placed in a thin bubble wrap (all 12 together), and should have been in a box to remain upright during shipment.",-1
The other reviewer was correct. It had a strong coconut taste but also had that nasty aftertaste that some of those cheap sugar substite products contain. My boyfried said it's almost like a liquorice (sp) aftertaste.  I ordered a huge thing of it b/c my son loves this flavor and he won't touch it again either.  I guess that's one we'll toss out and cut as a loss.,-1

"Bought this flavor of kettle brand chips in a 13 oz bag as an add-on item. Disgusting flavored chips. No cheddar taste. Not sure of sour cream.  Just YUK!!!!!!!!!  The chips were brown, burned, and broken.  Bag was greasy and what should have been seasoning on chips was matted on side and bottom.  Totally disgusting.  Buy @ you own risk.  Possibly bad because it was an add-on item.  Our experience with add-on items has been that they are bad or not available.",-1
"Whether it's the food or just my cats, NONE of them will touch it. Even the cat who turns his nose up to wet food and only eats dry food won't touch it. I wasn't impressed with it very much either. The pieces were rather large for my small cats and every time I poured it out, half of it seemed to be crushed dust. Disappointed and won't be buying again.",-1

"I am a cereal addict, and I admit that so I am kind of a cereal snob too. But I'll try anything once. This cereal was not just not very good to be blunt. I wouldn't spit it out, but I tossed the box, not even my 2 year old nephew would eat it. The flakes had a nice texture, but unfortunately actually did taste like cardboard. The raisins were good and there were actually a good number of them, but there weren't enough clusters for me to even evaluate the taste of them. If they could improve the flakes this would be a decent cereal, but that's just not the case. I'll stick to Raisin Nut Bran!",-1
I bought Greenmountain Vermont Country Blend for my home Keurig brewer because it was so good at work.  Got my box delivered to my home and was disappointed to find it way too weak.  Nothing like the brew at work.  I opened up a K-cup and added more coffee to it from another one and it was  normal (very good).  I'm getting an RMA number and sending it back along with the pumpkin spice coffee which was also too weak.,-1
"I was drinking a bottle or two of these per day to help me lose weight (these got me off Pepsi).  I began to have very bad skin pain and muscle pain in my side and arms, wrists after about 2 weeks of drinking these.  I was going to the doctor for the pain and was about to be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  I started an elimination diet as a last resort because I had not always had this pain (only recently).  After stopping the Izze drinks just by chance because I ran out and the store I was getting them at did not have the flavors I liked, the pain went away.  This pain was very bad.  I was becoming a person who could not have my children or spouse hug or touch me.  My clothes hurt where they touched my sides.  It hurt to sleep and lay on the mattress with my side.  I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink.",-1
"I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am totally disappointed.<br /><br />No real flavor what so ever.  I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing.  The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful.  Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me, the taste did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to anyone, and as for me I'm sticking with Tazo.",-1

"I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina.",-1

"Received package and was excited to try a healthy soup base alternative.  What could be better than Japanese style soup stock?  First ingredient... Salt.  Ok, so it's a soup base, I can kind of work with that.  Second ingredient... Mono-Sodium Glutamate, or other words MSG.  That means there is more MSG in the box then any other ingredient, except for of course, salt.  Tried to return it but policy prohibits it, so jokes on me :)  The disodium inosinate and disodium succinate aren't even recognized by the spell checking, but they are in there too ;) Looking forward to finding some without all the added chem, it actually sounds like a wonderful product without the ""added touches.""",-1

"I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!",-1

"This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet. (Ignore the claims that because it has saturated fat it must be bad for your heart - WRONG! Not all saturated fats are bad and coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which means the fat gets converted in your liver into energy and is not stored by the body nor will it clog your arteries.) Anyway, in order to reap the benefits of this wonderful oil you need to eat about 2 -3 tablespoons a day, starting with 1 and working your way up.  Guess how many of these pill you need to take in order to accomplish that feat? Something like 40!!  Have fun swallowing that many pills and just think about all the yucky gelatin you will be consuming that comprises the coating of these things!  You are much better off purchasing raw, organic coconut oil and mixing it your oatmeal or drinks.  Use it for cooking and throw away every other oil you have in your kitchen, except olive oil, and you will be on your way to better health.  Research the benefits of raw organic coconut oil online and you will see that I am right about this.",-1
"To start with, I'm a big fan of goji berries. A friend recommended another brand that I faithfully purchased until it was no longer available. I just found out it's name and packaging have changed and I've placed my order! In the interim, I purchased the Navitas brand and have been disappointed. There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag, which I never experienced with the ""other"" brand. I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea! FYI, I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea, sweetened with gojis. After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag. I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms. The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry, cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing any more products from this company.",-1

"I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.",-1

I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons.  The end result was a baked product that tasted foul.  I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning.  I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces).  When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past.

Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice.

"My first batch of Davidson Gunpowder green tea looked like the original images posted in this listing.  They were rolled tea leaves, but not as tightly as competitors.  Put them in water and the leaves would unfurl and reveal nice complete long leaves.  The taste was good.  For the price I thought it was great.  However the green tea I received around a month ago arrived and they didn't bother trying to roll the tea leaves at all, they simply diced up the leaves into small pieces and completely removed all moisture from the leaves to the point that they are so dry you can rub them easily between your fingers and the leaves crumble to a fine dust. There is nothing gun powder about this tea at all anymore.  Davidson needs to get this under control.  It wasn't worth the hassle of sending back so I am stuck with a pound of this barely palatable tea.  I've purchased lots of Davidson teas over the last year and had been extremely happy with all of them with the exception of this latest batch of Gunpowder green tea.  They should either bring back the Gunpowder that we expect and paid for or simply stop selling this inferior stuff that barely passes for tea.",-1

"Health Valley's Santa Fe Organic White Bean Chili is the WORST chili I've ever had. It's not incredibly spicy (I didn't end up having to put cheese,sour cream or yogurt on it) It vindicates those who believe vegan/vegetarian is bland and awful. Healthy,I'm sure,but not of the ""tastes good and good for you too"" ilk. There's nothing distinctively Southwestern about it either--like using black beans and blue corn. Fantastic World Foods' Southwestern Chili is not only better, but it's edible and its spiciness it punchy. Avoid this one. It probably is better as compost.",-1

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.",-1

"OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his ""full"" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!!

"I used to be a cook in college making eggs and pancakes for breakfast in the college dining hall.  It wasn't actually gourmet but it at least was a pancake.  I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet.  It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well.  I chucked the rest of the box out.  You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort.  Better to just eat a normal pancake with sugar free syrup than this stuff.",-1
"We just bought (from Amazon.com) a soft ice cream maker and while we love the maker we aren't thrilled with the fact that getting Dutch processed cocoa (the only kind recommended for use in ice cream) is very difficult.<br /><br />One thing for sure -- this ain't it.  It's only average in flavor, no where near what chocolate ice cream should taste like.  The fact they replaced their ""silver can"" product (the one recommended by all ice cream makers) with this one is despicable.  One reviewer here likened it to the ""new Coke"" fiasco but this is worse, because there are few alternatives (at least with new Coke there was Pepsi :>)<br /><br />If you are going to make ice cream you might want to try the Ghiradelli Dutch processed sweetened variety -- yes it is sweetened and thus you'll need to adjust your recipes, but it's easily obtained and reasonably priced.

Luxe is a Seattle company, another reason why I wanted to like this. Unfortunately, each kind is way too weak and flavorless. Do they use old, or poor quality tea? Was my box expired? It could be, but regardless, there is too little tea per bag. And even using 2 t-bags per cup, the flavor was still 'blah'. (I've also tried their supposed higher quality triangle bags, but the taste is the same.) To be fair, I didn't bother trying Chamomile and Earl Grey, so who knows, those could be good. The only one with a strong/good flavor and aroma is the Strawberry Seduction, but I wouldn't know how it compares with other brands as I don't care for strawberry tea.",-1
Go Raw has several others bars that taste really good. This one is not one I would buy again because of taste.,-1
"Over the years I have eaten MANY ""health"" bars, fiber bars, protein bars, etc.  I usually eat a protein bar a day, and I am very used to the chalky texture and taste of protein bars and have learned to overcome them.  The Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bar is not a protein bar, but tastes almost as bad as that. Correction, it tastes, worse than a protein bar.  There is no real chocolate taste to it at all, and the protein chunks that are in it taste like these cheap almond pieces they used to shove into candy bars 30 years ago, way too small to offer any real taste.  Actually, they taste just like the nuts you get in brownies. I love almonds, but hated the taste of these. I forced myself to eat three of these bars so I could give them an accurate review, and that was extremely difficult.<br /><br />The selling point of Pure Bars are that they are made with natural, whole ingredients and are vegetarian and gluten-free.  As someone who is trying to avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup and added sugar, I like that, however it doesn't do me any good if I can't enjoy the product enough to consume it.  I know some reviews have claimed that these are ""health bars"" and that they have too much sugar, but they are not marketed as a ""health bar.""  Too many people confuse the ideas of ""whole"" and ""natural"" foods as ""health"" foods, which is entirely not the case. The idea is that these bars are for people who don't want additives and a lot of over-processing in their food, it's just unfortunately that they taste so bad.  If you're looking for a better-tasting alternative, I'd suggestion the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00199KYSO"">-  Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Variety Bars (All Natural) - 24 ct.

I have tried everything to get rid of these creepy little flyers!!! Peppermint oil... nope... bug spray... nope... bay leaves... nope...soap and water... nope... thowing everything away and storing everything in glass sealed jars... nope... freezing everything that comes into this house... nope.<br /><br />So I found these stupid little traps. So I buy them... follow the directions... and put it in my cabinet. The pantry moths would fly all around the trap... like they were really excited... Eager to get rid of these little buggars I sat and watched the trap... One flew in... landed on the sticky tape... fluttered around a little bit and was gone. He never stuck. So I checked the trap and stuck my finger on the glue it was sticky alright. So I thought maybe he just got lucky. So I watched the next one... he did the same thing!!!! I was LIVID!!! How in the world am I going to get rid of these things? So I figured... just leave the trap up and see what happends. 3 weeks later (they say replace every 3 weeks) I checked the trap.... NOT ONE MOTH WAS ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the heck???!!!! There where a bunch of black / brown marks on the tape... but not one moth. BOTTOM LINE: DONT BUY THIS IT DOESNT WORK!!! If anyone has any advise... I would love some!!!,-1
"The stores all carry either the Arnold Palmer Lite(most common, better tasting), or the Zero(less calories, but less flavor).  This mix produces an iced tea that tastes like neither of them.  Somehow the settling that occurs with this mix, makes it either come out too sweet, or too sour.  For one thing, it's sugar based, not splenda like the lite in the stores.  The amount the directions say to mix do not give the drink enough flavor, you'll use more than the directions say.  I bought this once, but will not buy again.",-1

"After taking recommendations from Petco employees and a few show breeders, I decided to spend the money and feed my dog this food.  She is a 75lbs.

He had me switch to rice and chicken for a week, and that didn't help the problem (damaged intestines take longer than a week to heal).  So back to Pro Plan I went.  Finally after 2 years,  I smartened up and switched her to quality grain-free dog food.  Within 2 weeks, her intestines healed up and she had firm stools with no blood in them.  I was AMAZED after dealing with bloody diarrhea for the past 2 years.  Purina dog food is poison, as are all Purina products and all other brands of mainstream dog food.

So I made a second cup and watched the coffee as it came out of the Keurig. The last half of the brew was just clear water..... Terrible.<br /><br />So I grabbed a Green Mountain K-Cup and shook it. I could hear the coffee moving around inside and felt the weight compared the Gloria Jean.

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:54 Mins<br /><br /></span>I cannot recommend these unhealthy cookies. They contain too much fat, sometimes canola oil (more healthy), sometimes palm oil (less healthy).  They are very sweet.

It is however palatable.  The cookie layer was soggy. I have eaten the UK equivalent of these Mallomars (Chocolate Marshmallows) as a child and the base was much crisper. The base tasted stale.  The cookies were broken, some stuck together, others fell apart.<br /><br />Unhealthy foods like this are to be avoided, except perhaps for children's parties, but even then this package was so badly handled that the cookies were not presentable.  Instead get ideas for healthy food from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060928115"">Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish: 150 Easy, Low-Fat, High-Flavor Recipes</a>.

It also reports that Nabisco only makes Mallomars from October to April, either for marketing reasons or because they do not keep well in warm tempratures - it would be good from someone from Nabisco to verify if this is the case. Clearly my Mallomars suffered from poor storage and inadequate packing, as did those of many other reviewers.",-1
"I got a box full of mayonnaise packets, and there likely are about 200 in there (I'm not going to count them) but they are NOT the Heinz mayonnaise packets pictured. They are a generic 'Mayonnaise' packet (blue lettering on white background) - the same kind I used to have in my office's break room in the early 1990s. I don't doubt they'll taste fine as far as mayonnaise goes, but it's not what is advertised.<br /><br />Another issue is that there are no expiration dates, either on the box or the packets themselves. This would be helpful information to have as we are storing these for use with canned chicken and tuna for emergency food storage. There is only a production date, so I will have to use my own judgement on how long mayo is likely good after being produced!",-1
"After reading the negative review about the person's dog getting ill from these, I had to add my own 2 cents.  Like that person, I never buy anything made outside of the US for my dogs.  Until I bought these, on accident.  I can sympathize with his dog getting ill -- but I have 7 dogs and they all love these and have never gotten sick.  I keep the jar (love that it's a jar) by the door as a potty treat reward.  They love them.  I have all different breeds and sizes.  Even a bulldog with a sensitive tummy.  She has no problem with these.  These are the only treats I will buy from another country.  They're healthy, low calorie and my dogs will come inside from way back in the yard for these!<br /><br />Update 11/28/11:  Ordered my third jar of these and they were hard as a rock.

I wouldn't have minded that since they were less than $2.00 each, what I did mind was the $15.00 I paid in shipping for 2 SLICES!!!!<br />I contacted the company about the situation while stewing like a pot but never heard anything back for at least 6 weeks and by that time I was so PO'd, I<br />had thrown them in our back woods for the raccoons just to show them!! (I know, I know. I call that Menopause ratioanality.) So anyway I really don't know if my dog's would have liked them or not.",-1
"I thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it to order this as a subscribe and save , but when I went back to reorder, the price had tripled... Amazon should notify of these changes.

It did not taste good at all.  It was if they soak it in the mandarin orange way to long.  It made it soaking and way over powering.,-1
"The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels. In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.",-1
"I'm a coffee lover and I love to try different flavors and brands because you never know until you try it. Well I tried this one. The 1st brew, I thought maybe I just needed to mix my creamer and sugar differently. So I tried it a 2nd and a 3rd... all were equally gross!! I never finished it and threw it away... it was just simply gross...",-1
"We have an aussie-german shepherd mix and he does NOT tolerate this product at all.  He loved it, but it gave him a very bad case of diarrhea and he needed medical treatment several days after eating the<br /><br />""dingo"" brand product.

"The cookies were not fresh and had become rather crumbly. As much as I love the Famous Amos Oatmeal cookies, I was really disappointed in the quality of what I received. I ended up throwing away 7 of the 8 packs that I received.",-1
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",-1
"This is actually a flavoring agent that starts with an aftertaste.  Is is the hideous taste of cheap candy, maybe OK for a three-year-old but an assault to the palate of an adult.  After the flavor develops it gets worse.  I bought two bottles and threw them away after the first taste.",-1
This is a great product and my kids love it but... Make sure you contact sellers before you buy it. I purchased under the assumption that I was getting 8 boxes of juice. I only received one box for $14.25 and sellers fees to return are outrageous not even worth returning! I can get these for $3.99 at my local grocery store which is why I jumped at the chance to pay less than $2/box. But it ended up being $2/pouch. I hope they specify better in the future but I doubt it they probably hope more people are dumb like me to make a huge profit. Please contact seller first and dont make same mistake I did.,-1
"I am not a tea expert by any means, but I drink a lot of hot teas (black, green, white, spiced, herbal, etc.) and I know what I like.  Unfortunately, I just do not like this tea.  I agree with the reviewer who said it had a sharp peppery finish, but that is about the only taste it has.  The smell of the tea reminds me of black licorice and fresh mowed grass - a nauseating combination for me, not pleasant.  Since this tea has garnered so many great reviews, maybe it is just my taster.  Also, I have never tasted any other Darjeeling teas other than this one by Twinnings to compare, so maybe I just don't like Darjeeling tea.  However, I love all the other Twinnings' teas and drink them daily (except for Oolong, but that is a different review).",-1
My cats went on hunger strike when I put this food out. None of our cats would touch it. Even our dog who likes to steal the cat food would not touch it. So I just threw it out.,-1

I opened one bottle and removed the seal to smell the ""essence"". Wow, to my surprise not only was the bottle less than half full, but the contents are powder, no body to the ingredients what so ever!! This stuff is not cheap and from now on I will buy items like this in my local stores, that way I can take it back if it is like this stuff. BAM, my butt. This will also make me very wary of any other Emeril stuff.",-1

"First, I want to be clear, I love Rice Dream and I think it's a great product.  This bad review is just my way of warning others out there that think ordering grocery is safe with Amazon.  It's not!  I've ordered grocery multiple times and have had packages arrive at my doorstep busted and crawling with bugs.  It's so upsetting to get a package like that, particularly when you find out Amazon does NOT give refunds or extend credit for faulty shipments like these.  Trust me, it's not a good deal to buy from Amazon when things arrived ruined.  It's cheaper to just buy it at the grocery store!",-1
"I just looked at an unopened bottle on my shelf and saw crap floating around in it which looked like mold.  You know, the stuff that looks a little dark and a lot slimy.  Gross.  There were also crystals floating around.  The expiration date was in 2014 and we ordered it about three months ago (June 2012).  No more liquid for us.  We just threw this one away and canceled our subscribe and save order.<br /><br />Makes me wonder if this is why my wife has been ill for the last few weeks.  Threw what was left of that bottle away, too.<br /><br />By the way, my lot number was 1203123, best by 03/14.",-1
"Quality of the peanuts are okay (on a quality rating scale of okay, good and fine) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest I have found in my local grocery chains.

"I've been looking at all the local grocery stores for teething biscuits for my 7 month old daughter. When I didn't find any there, I ordered a case of these. Unfortunately it's a total waste of money. I tried giving them to my daughter twice and both times she instantly broke off a piece that was perfect choking size. They're too easily broken to be good gnawing biscuits, and don't melt in the mouth fast enough to overcome that problem. It's back to the drawing board for me while whole boxes of these sit unused. For what it's worth, they're also really bland flavored.",-1

Title says it all.  They reformulated to add artificial sweeteners to their regular hot cocoa.  I didn't notice until I tasted it and thought I accidentally bought the diet stuff.  Nope -- they put splenda and asculfame K (asculfame potassium) into their formula now.  It's really gross -- much too sweet with a terrible aftertaste.,-1

"There is no picture, so I assume this is the dry mix with cilantro.<br /><br />I bought it at a dollar store. It isn't even worth that.<br /><br />All you taste is the sugar.

"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic.

"At first this didn't taste like anything.  By time I added enough Mio to taste something, I was then disgusted by the flavor.  I like tea, truly I do.  This is not tea.

"I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, in a box containing 2 bags. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.",-1

"If you are giving your dog salmon oil, I would highly suggest finding one that is from wild salmon - it has many more benefits than farmed and is much healthier for your dog.  Farmed salmon are given antibiotics and fed grain, and therefore don't produce the pink color naturally as they're not allowed to do their native behaviors. I had been using this brand for about a year, and once I found this out I switched to Alaskan as it's the same price and much healthier. Do your research before buying the right salmon oil.",-1

I sneak a bite at every buffet and Thanksgiving dinner, even though I know it's for ""the kids"" and it's bad for my health.<br /><br />When I saw this, the marketing seemed to be aimed at grown-ups, and I thought, ""maybe my wife will let me get away with this.""<br /><br />It tasted like chicken covered in ballpark nacho cheese sauce.<br /><br />Orzo is a terrible choice for mac & cheese. If you follow the instructions, the Orzo becomes overcooked and its texture is so similar to the sauce itself it effectively dissolves. The cheese/starch ratio is too high. It should have been elbow or penne.<br /><br />Green dust came out of the broccoli packet. Once rehydrated, it looked more like broccoli, but there wasn't enough.

It does not disolve well at all and leaves chunks of formula in the bottle regardless how well you mix it and whether you use warm or cold water to dilute it with.

I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons. The end result was a baked product that tasted foul. I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning. I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces). When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past. I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for. (?) This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.",-1

"I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.",-1

"Being unable to find canned pumpkin in any of my local stores, I held my breath (after reading the mixed reviews and mentions of damaged cans), took a chance and ordered a 12 pack.  Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult/impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher.",-1

I won't try anything from them again.",-1
"I can't believe this coffee has a 5 star rating and people give it positive reviews. The flavor is repulsive and makes me feel sick to my stomach. I am not blaming the roaster or Amazon. It's the coffee itself. I love good quality Columbian, Kenyan, Guatamalan, Sumatra, Costa Rican, Zimbabwe, Papau New Guinea, Ethiopian and others...this is the first time I tried Tanzanian and I hate it. If you like any of the coffees I mentioned you are not likely to enjoy or even be able to tolerate this. It tastes like what you might get if you poured hot water through a bag of dirty, old pennies. It makes me sick just thinking about it. Trust me and do not believe the positive reveiews like I did...for $45. I bought five pounds of regret.",-1
"the gum is too sweet,and doesnt last like it used too.. i tested it and in 2 hrs,the gum starts to get really hard to chew,plus the taste is gone.. had to spit it.. i bought another flavor ahead of this,and that one was longer lasting.. i grew tired of chewing it.. just to see how long it will last,but i didnt last! so i guess that's a good review",-1
"I puchased this container for Easter Baskets for my allergic to everything boys.  I couldn't get the recipe on Amazon which is odd because most things claiming to be good for people with allergies have the ingredients readily available.  In any event I went to their website which has toggles for the ingredients list but don't do anything when you click on them.  The site proudly boasts ""No High Fructose Corn Syrup"" though.  I sent an email query out and it's been a few days with no response.  The question was simple ""Is there any corn product in the Jelly Beans or Sour Bunnies?""  I've never given a bad review but in light of the fact that the jelly beans' very fist ingredient is corn syrup at the very least for $25 they should taste as good or close to something like Jelly Belly.  They taste like Jelly Beans and nothing more, nothing gourmet.  There is nothing here to recommend you to pay that kind of money for them certainly not the service.",-1
"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more.",-1
"I ordered the 3-jar pack and 2 of the 3 were totally stale...yuck!  None of the jars had dates on them (sell by...) and the olives did not have habanero in them.  The tiny habanero pieces were at the bottom of the jar.  I'm assuming they were so old the stuffing fell out.  Granted, one of the jars was very fresh...and I loved it.  But 1-of-3 doesn't cut it when you spend $20 on them as a trio.  I won't order these again.  I'd rather have regular pimento olives from the local market...fresher...tastier...and 1/3 the cost.  By the way, habanero chili is the hottest available.  These were not (in my opinion) habanero's.  They weren't even of jalapeno calibre.  Buy a jar of $1.99 plain olives and put Tabasco on them.  Much better.",-1
"I was so excited about this chocolate tea! After reading rave reviews I thought I would give it a try. It tastes like you are drinking water-downed baking chocolate. It was incredibly bitter. I added a bit of raw sugar which helped a bit, but it didn't make it amazing. I think the only way that it could possible taste good is if you made it with hot milk and a lot of sugar. At that point you might as well just have normal hot chocolate. Save yourself the money- don't buy this.<br /><br />Side comment: I never received the lid to the tin. Who sends a tin without a lid? I am really not sure.",-1

I used to frequent Gloria Jean's while growing up in So.Cal and like their icy sweet drinks before Coffee Bean or Starbucks had a comparable offering. Fast forward to today.

I've been to France & Italy half a dozen times and fully enjoy espresso drinks while dining there. That said, what I was expecting was something that tasked vaguely like espresso perhaps or a full bodied roast. That is not what this delivers.",-1

Forgive me if I don't take anyone's word on that, and why would I want to eat glue anyway when I'm paying extra for a healthy alternative.  No thanks.  I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese products now and will remain with these as they have the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes.",-1
"I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts. I am actively seeking, like other customers, a new replacement. I tried Muscle Milk the other day -- GROSS!",-1
I drink Starbucks coffee at home each morning.  I like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts.  I am not a huge fan of flavored creamers but on occaision I will get a vanilla flavored coffee at a bagel shop.  I was excited to see Starbucks new line of flavored coffees because I assumed the quality would be just as good as their regular coffees and that the premium price would provide a genuine good hint of vanilla flavor.  I was deeply dissappointed in the strong artificial vanilla smell and taste when I brewed this coffee.  I couldn't even drink it with my 1/2 & 1/2 in it. It was worse than any gas station flavored coffee or instant vanilla coffee beverage I have tried.  The aftertaste was terrible and I had to throw away the remaining coffee.,-1

"I think both the seller and amazon share the blame for this item purchased as a gift arriving totally unpresentable as a gift, and maybe inedible. You see, this item isn't really packaged for shipping or for freshness. The candies arrived having fallen out of their little compartments and jumbled in a heap to one end of the now bulging box. The candies are banged up and there's maple sugar dust all over the outside of the box. Packed this way, with no seal, I'm guessing the candies are hard as rocks. Very disappointed in this seller.<br /><br />Now for amazon: the little plastic air pouches used in packing were completely deflated. This item was packed with an engagement calendar in a box that probably could have held three times as much merchandise. So the contents were obviously banged around a lot. I really don't have time to pack this up and run 9 miles to a post office to return it.",-1

"They've got the appearance of licorice, but close your eyes and you would be hard pressed to identify the taste if someone put one in your mouth. They're really, really bland.<br /><br />If you try hard, you can taste a bit of licorice flavor, but would it have really hurt to put some more licorice oil in there? After all, those of us trying to avoid sugar are not trying to avoid licorice oil.<br /><br />The consistency isn't great either. It's a bit starchy. But I'd take it if they had any taste.

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea.

I was sent an email on special sales, saying this was slashed in price from $70 to $15.87 a savings of 77%, for a pack of 12.  I ordered the apple mashers once when they were on a special, so I thought this was the same special.  Who would order 3 boxes for $15.89 when they could get 4 boxes for less.  Before, a a pack of 12 was 12 boxes with 4 mashers in each.

The coffee does not have a nice taste, it is not better than any grocery store brand. It's flavor is strong, but not in a good way, rather like badly roasted coffee. I know some people like fruity (acidic) flavor and some like nutty flavor (like me) in their coffee, but Melitta coffee has neither, it is more like coffee flavored mud. On top of all, I wasn't able to return the coffee because it turns out Amazon does not allow returns on some grocery items.<br /><br />If you doubt my review because of all other glorifying reviews, well, when I ordered this coffee there was not even a single negative review. That's the way I was fooled. However, if you don't care much about the quality of coffee but just need caffeine this coffee may be right choice for you.

Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand.

Surprised with this one as the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf rules Cali and serves up the best Coffee and Teas. I tried many cups and am can say this Chai is my least favorite Chai ever. The tea is like warm water and very weak. I would not suggest this to anyone that enjoys a good tea.,-1

"Received Xmas of 06. Worked great about two times. New probe March 07. $15 plus/shipg/tax= 21.15. Worked fine until last night and started beeping and showed cooked before I inserted probe.

Appears to cost more than the rest ??? I'm shoppin...... enough of this brand.",-1

"I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!",-1
"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.",-1
"I generally like all of Newman's Own food products, particularly their salad dressings, so was surprised to find these ginger snaps completely inedible. It doesn't matter how healthy a snack might or might not be - if it doesn't taste good, the healthy question is a moot point. And Newman's Own simply got something wrong with this recipe because these little cookies are just no good. I let various members of my family try them just to make sure it wasn't just me who found them tasteless, and there was a unanimous thumbs down. I'll go for other brands of ginger snaps and stick with salad dressing, pasta sauces and such from Newman's.",-1

"I have been giving my 8 month old happy bellies for the last month and noticed that after a process of elimination, this cereal has caused my baby to have a yeast diaper rash. She loved eating it so I gave it to her daily. I've done everything to take care of her diaper rash but it persisted even after I started applying nystatin which her pediatrician prescribed. I then decided to eliminate foods and monitor what happened to the rash and identified the happy bellies as the culprit. It's too bad because I thought that the probiotics would do her good but instead she's developed an annoying yeast diaper rash. Has anyone else's baby had any allergic reactions to this cereal?",-1

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.",-1
"the chips tasted all right, but everything else about them was very disappointing.

"I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was ""off"" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product ""LaraBar"" by ""LaraBar"".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.",-1
"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",-1

A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.",-1
"(NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: ""Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled ""Bad"" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives.""<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!",-1
"Ordered a 50 pack to be delivered directly from Starbucks.  Two weeks later, received an email from Amazon stating that seller (Starbucks) failed to deliver the product by the date they said they would when purchased, so I should contact them directly for status.  When I did, the Starbucks rep told me they had processing issues on the date I placed my order (for a number of people) and had cancelled it.  When I asked why they failed to even tell me this prior to me reaching out to them, they had no answer.  To compound matters, they then refused to send me a replacement order for the same price I previously paid.  Seriously???  I usually don't write negative reviews, but this experience goes well over the line for me.  Obviously, Starbucks has gotten so big that they could care less about making their customers whole after THEY mess up.

Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient.

This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate.  Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers!  Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN!  Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers?  I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper.,-1
"I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla. There is absolutely no vanilla aroma when I added it to my custards, even with additional amount. Sure, the vanilla specks are there, but what good would they do if they give nothing to the flavor of the dish? I must have gotten a bad bottle or something (is that even possible, for vanilla bean paste to go bad?). I'm quite disappointed, looks like I'll just have to stick with Costco vanilla extract from now on.",-1

"By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs.",-1

I make all my daughters food and thankfully she prefers what I make over jar food.  I do have those times when I need something quick to grab on the go.  Ella's Organics is a great go to.

Check out Dr. Russell Blaylock's vidoes on youtube re: the DANGER of MSG.  And the over 30 names used in food products to hide the fact that there is MSG<br />in it.  It says ""no ADDED MSG"" which just means they didn't add any themselves, but it in no way means they don't use ingredients which already have MSG in them.",-1
"I wasted the whole bottle of ""Critter ridder"" on a small lawn, which was overturned each night by a raccoon. I tried spraing on grass, then on the ground under the grass and bottom side of sod (that's where raccoon finds grubs), but it didn't care at all. Aparently, ""Critter ridder"" simply made his lunch spicy - that's all. It keeps coming back each night.",-1

"The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food. I thought it would be smart to order through Amazon, since it is difficult to find in stores, but that was a mistake. It has been 14 days since I ordered, and the product has not yet arrive. Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver. The seller must have asked for special slow delivery... Never again will I buy from this seller.",-1
"I bought this in bulk unforntley!!The cake was hard as a rock nd I made it 3 different times. The taste of this cake is just awful.My three teenage boys tried it and spit it out fast,and they will eat just about anything.I would have returned the boxes if I didnt have to pay for the shipping.",-1

"This popcorn left an unpleasant-tasting layer of some waxy substance that built up in my mouth---on my teeth, lips, and tongue---as I ate. This was so nasty the person I was sharing it with simply stopped eating it. I hate wasting food, so I ate the rest even though I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm really curious what ingredient might have been responsible for this phenomenon. Could it indeed be some kind of wax? Unfortunately I couldn't find this variety of popcorn on Newman's Own Web site. Perhaps it's been discontinued; I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.",-1
I was looking for bulk pixie stix in little packages to give out for halloween. The picture shows a box of individual packages which is what I thought I was getting. What I received was a tiny bag of 48 individual little pixie sticks. I can pick up a bag at the store here for a couple of bucks. Very misleading (and I'm sure deliberately misleading) picture.,-1

"I ordered these for my 29 pound Wheaten Terrier as she munches on them.  This packaged was labeled exactly the same as the previous packages (size).  However, when I received them each chewie was half the size and paper thin.  These were not fit for a very small dog, let alone a medium dog.  I threw them away as I would not take a chance that my dog would choke on them.  I then decided to call the company.  I was told that they were aware of the problem and needed to do something with their quality control.  I ask her where they were made and she told me Mexico. BE WARE.",-1

"This is suppose to be a ""healthy"" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor.

"This package arrived with three bags of coffee inside of a plastic outer bag. The outer bag was full of coffee grinds. Upon inspection, I found a hole (about 1/2"" long) in the bottom of one of the coffee bags. I cannot believe that someone didn't noticed the grinds all over the bag before it shipped. However, perhaps they did but did not care as the customer cannot return the item. I've used the other two bags but had to throw out the open one for safety reasons. DO NOT BUY!!!",-1

This was some of the most horrid and disgusting coffee I've ever had. Something was off about it. You could make better tasting coffee through a used diaper I think. Avoid. Honestly. It was horrible.,-1
Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers. So I happen to like Hazelnut flavored coffee and I drink it often. When I saw the chance to get some for home it looked like a good idea. Idea may have been good but the Gloria Jean Hazelnut flavored coffee fell flat on my taste buds. The best I could give it is 'adequate' since the gas station on my way to work has stuff much better for a fair price. I will use the Gloria Jean stuff up then forget about it because I don't want to be bothered sending it back. Live and learn and take the bad with the good to let an educated perception be my guide.,-1
This is the worst beef jerky I have ever tasted. It was not dried as expected and very mushy an tasted nothing like teryaki flavor that I purchased. I recommend staying away from this product.,-1
"Quick, someone please hand me a towel so I can wipe this off my tongue.  The can says: ""It's what soda should always have been"".  If all ""regular"" sodas were like this, sodas would be only tolerated, not drunk by the gallons by a large percentage of the population.  That's not to say that ""regular"" sodas are good, I don't like them anymore either since eliminating high fructose corn syrup from my diet.  This has a very bland taste & a horrible cling-to-the-back-of-the-tongue aftertaste.  I use stevia all the time & was surprised at the odd flavor.  This also does not taste anything like Mt. Dew.",-1
"As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5"" deep, 2 1/8"" wide and 2 1/4"" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow.",-1
"This sounds like such a good idea. I bought an Oreo pie crust to turn it into an Oreo pie.<br /><br />It might have worked if Jell-O had packaged the cookie pieces separately so they could be folded into the pudding after it was mixed. But the cookie bits were already in the pudding mix. The problem is that when you mix in the milk to make the pudding, the cookie bits get completely broken apart.<br /><br />So what you end up with is GRAY pudding--GROSS. The taste is OK but it looks like a mud pie.<br /><br />Definitely not one of Jell-O's best ideas. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",-1
"I assumed that bulk purchases of this type would be fresh, drop shipped as a rule, but I have serious doubts now.  I have had the fresh gum, this isn't even close.

As usual, Amazon does an incredible job of processing, expeding & getting shipped-every time!",-1
"I've really enjoyed every Starbucks Via variety I've tried -- the Italian and Colombian roasts, caramel and iced coffees especially. However, I've been hoping for a more mild blend since Starbucks can be a little too strong at times. So I was really excited to try this Breakfast Blend via, which is labeled as ""mild."" Sadly, it's anything but. It's not only still strong, but also bitter, and leaves an awful sour aftertaste. I can't bring myself to drink another cup, even if it means a waste of money. Horrible.",-1

"I found this frosting pretty disgusting.  And I'm not one to be very likely to put the words ""frosting"" and ""disgusting"" in the same sentence.  It ended up tasting mainly like butter.  When I scraped it off into the sink, it just stayed in one clump and wouldn't even rinse down the sink very easily (like you'd expect from butter).  And even if you like the taste of a bunch of butter on your cake, save yourself some money.  The only ingredients in this mix are powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt.  You can buy all those very cheaply and still add all the butter the directions call for (2.5 sticks!).  Gross!",-1
"Bought this to go with  20 lb of Basmati rice. I'm sure there was a review here that said it tasted like fresh cut grass,<br /><br />It tastes like cut grass on the bottom of the lawn mower after a week.<br /><br />Found out  Basmatti doesn't need seasoning, just a little salt.",-1

If you do just a little research you will realize two things. 1. Raw Honey will crystallize almost immediately and 2. nearly all retail honey is cut with corn syrup. So if your not buying from the person who is actually tending the bees and they state that they are not heating the honey to get it out of the comb but have a spinner then it is truly raw and not cut with corn syrup. If it's too good to be true then it probably is.,-1

"As other reviewers have stated, it taste good as long as you keep chugging it, but as soon as you stop it has a horrid aftertaste.  The only way that I can describe it is that it taste like black licorice.  Yuck, I'd rather eat a bar of soap!!!",-1
"Not only does the taste of this nacho cheese leave something to be desired,(I purchased a recommended brand along with this one for comparison) but it also contains yeast extract. In short yeast extract is a substance the food industry has turned to in light of the consumer response to MSG. Like MSG yeast extract also contains free glutamic acid. I have a sensitive metabolism and will usually develop an allergic reaction to most of the unsavory chemicals that appear in processed food. I sampled half a serving of this cheese and sure enough I had the same response to MSG (the recommended brand of nacho cheese I purchased along with this one did not produce the same results and tastes better too, it does not contain yeast extract).

I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to bread chicken- just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.

I wouldn't recommend buying this product.,-1
This isn't a bash on Nutiva's product specifically but more of a warning to the greater community.  I found out the hard way that all Protein Powders basically contain Aspartame and MSG.  This is because the Aspartate and Glutamate in the products are in free form and are rapidly absorbed by the body.  If you have any allergies or issues with neurotoxins buyer beware.,-1
"I used to love these when they were still available in the U.S.  I ordered them from this seller and they tasted like axle grease.  I'm not even kidding.  I was skeptical from the moment I opened the package considering they had used musty old newspaper for padding.  They refused to refund my money on the grounds that they hadn't heard complaints from any other customers, which seems like a blatant lie considering there are other reviews on here complaining about the exact same thing.

"My dachshund recently needed to start taking pills three times a day. He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog.",-1
I purchased the Turkey pouches because my 8 month old loved the Chick Chick.  This is nothing like the Chick Chick.  This looks like a dry paste and it smells bad too.  Currently I'm mixing them with a jar of the Earth's Best Organics 2oz veggie jar in order to give it some texture other than cat food.  This is absolutely nothing like the Chick Chick with is a hearty puree with actual pieces of chicken and pasta.  I would not recommend it.,-1

I ordered these capsules to go with the Krups Nescafe Dolce Gusto one cup coffee maker that I purchased from Amazon.  Unfortunately I have to return the coffee maker (unless they take other coffee pods NOT made by Nescafe) The coffee from these pods taste terrible and one out of five pods used so far are defective duds! They are filled with only powdered milk (yuck) and no coffee or cocoa.  I don't know about the other one cup coffee pods but these are definitely instant coffee in a pod. Heck I can pick up some Taster's Choice and powdered creamer and save me a lot of mess and money!

"I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the ""Whole Rabbit"" from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.<br /><br />The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).<br /><br />I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me? I will never buy rabbit from the internet again, I will stick to the live ones at the pet shop. I just need to make sure my Burmese python isn't roaming the house free when I bring the live one home... wish me luck!",-1

"We got this flavor because it was A)on sale and B)Emerils- it should be tasty, right? WRONG. I won't go on and on about how much I dislike it, and it's all personal taste, but I like strong coffee and this is strong...in the wrong way. It tastes like burnt cigarettes smell. Like cigarette butts. And its aroma matches, making this non-smoker's house smell like a lounge. It is thick as tar and even if diluted with water, still retains a burnt ash taste that coats the inside of my mouth. We have had a 12 pack for over 6 months...the last two are going in the garbage, like tossing away a dollar bill. I'll stick to Dark Magic for a nice strong coffee. But, if you like that smokey flavor, this may be good for you. I personally feel like I licked an ashtray and have to brush my teeth after every sip.

"I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.

"I'm surprised at the good reviews... maybe there are quality control problems.... I purchased some this week and I find it bear very little resemblance to Almond butter. When I opened the jar I smelled oil, vegetable oil, not almonds or any kind of nut. There was a very large amount of oil on the top (more than I have ever seen on Almond butter), stirring it was a lot more work than mixing Laura Scudder's Natural, I had to parcel it out into smaller containers and mix in stages. Once mixed it does not taste like Almond butter, it is still predominately oily. The ingredients do not acknowledge other added oils, but I would be willing to bet on it...<br />I'd advise, try other brands, Trader Joe's for one, tastes and spreads like Almond butter.<br /><br />it only got one star because I can't give less...",-1

"I ordered these steaks for a dinner party. I contacted the seller to let them know that my guests had more than enough negative comments on the steaks. They had said that they were inedible, that they were grainy and fatty. There was also a comment that they had shrunk considerably in size. We spent well over $300 for this product only to be extremely disappointed. We wound up throwing the half eaten steaks out.  When I contacted the seller, they could careless on what my guests had said. Couldnt care that we wound up throwing away over $300 in steaks and did not want to credit my account nor re-ship the product to satisfy a commitment.<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE.....DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.

But now having paid over $60 for 2 stale cases, you will lose a good customer if this happens again.",-1
"I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like ""THREE DOG BAKERY"" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it.

"How they can advertise this product as ""healthy"" when it contains hydrogenated oil is beyond me. Clearly they have sold their souls to the devil. Because the FDA (also in the devil's pocket) allows products to advertise ""no trans fat"" when the amount of trans fat per serving is .5 g or less, these people can get away with lying to the American public.

"Gave my Dachshund this Hartz ""Premium"" bone for ""aggressive chewers"" on Sunday afternoon.  By dinner Monday she was not eating or drinking.  By Tuesday morning (this day) she was throwing up bright red pools of blood!  I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz ""Premium"" bone for ""aggressive chewers"" tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz ""Premium"" bones for ""aggressive chewers"" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.",-1
"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!",-1
"My girl surprised me with a jar of Baconnaise this week after I'd gazed wishfully at the jar in a couple of fancy food stores over the last year. I was delighted to receive it, since I'm a fan of all kinds of smoky flavors, bacon and otherwise. I've had vegetarian ""bacon strips"" and vegan bacon bits that were tasty, and I think even turkey bacon is okay if you cook it right, so the bar was not set too high at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Baconnaise can't even reach that Bac-Os level of fake bacon flavor. One small dab for each of us, and we recoiled and put the lid back on. If the label hadn't told me to expect it to taste like bacon, I have no idea what I would have thought it tasted like, but it would not have been bacon. Or mayonnaise, for that matter. Its flavor is complex, and I could see someone developing a taste for it, as with other products with flavors derived from yeast or other kinds of fermentation.<br /><br />That someone will not be me, though. I offered some to our three bacon-loving cats as a kind of second (or third, fourth and fifth) opinion. They couldn't get away from it fast enough either, and one of them even steals the vegan ""jerky"" I buy from time to time. So the Baconnaise ended up in the garbage bin. For now, if I want to add bacon flavor to something without adding bacon, I'll stick with the bright red facon bits.<br /><br />Maybe it's just an individual preference thing. I see a wide range of opinions in the reviews to date. I may still try J&D's other products -- they have a version of Bacon Salt that's free of MSG, for example -- but for me, Baconnaise doesn't live up to the hype, the promise, or even its own label.",-1
"When I bought this bread I paid about $4 more for the shipment for 4 boxes instead of the usual 6 so about $4 a box vs $2 for the more ordinary white, wheat, or potato breads.As I prepared the mix I saw NO Raisins I did pour it in the machine before really taking a close look so I thought maybe they were in the botton or something.It smelled great while baking but, when a cut a piece no raisins! It did seem to taste slightly raisiny so my best guess is maybe they used ground up raisins? There are raisins on the ingrediaent list.At best this is just a cinnamon bread.<br />The search goes on.<br />Ps I can't get over the disconnect between my expercience and the other reviews.. maybe I got a bad box.",-1

"If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of ""guac-a-mole"" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) ""new look, same great taste"" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the ""Mad-Men"" era I grew up in.",-1

Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.",-1

"Little lesson on TRUFFLES...<br />Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.<br /><br />Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.<br />NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",-1

"I have used these products for several years for my Cairn Terrier. Have always purchased them in health food stores and felt it was a safe product. Never had a problem. However, I recently(June) purchased this item from Amazon and recieved the 6 bags. It took a couple of severe illnesses in my dog for me to connect the mellow mut strips. He initially started vomiting yellow bile and it proceeded to a vomiting/diarrhea progression that lasted for two weeks with much abdominal pain. The first time, I thought he had just injested something outside that had caused inflammation in his abdominal tract. My dog eats an excellent, mostly organic diet...is seven years old and in great health and vitality. After the first bout of this ""mystery illness"" I didnt give him any treats for a while(because of the dehydrated form) just a very bland diet of rice and chicken/beef working back in to adding veggies etc that would be in his normal diet...he was fine. A few days ago, with the presence of wonderful health in my dog, I opened a bag of the mellow mut strips and gave him one per day for three days. Here we are again, same illness...same symptoms.

"Companies like this go to great lengths to try to disguise the fact that their products are made in China. Some are advertsing ""Made under US supervision"". In this case they keep emphasizing that their products are ""tested in the US"". I wrote to them asking where the product was manufactured and they never responded but it appears that the products are actually made in China. ""Tested in the US"" means close to nothing as they obviously cannot test every single treat. In the last few years the FDA has issued three warnings about chicken tender/jerky treats made in China and their harmful effects on dogs. Thus you are taking a real risk by buying a product like this. Curiously in the case of this product it is not any cheaper than buying a similar one MADE in the US so I can see absolutely no reason to buy these.

I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup  to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result.  In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired.",-1
This is really gross. Salty beyond belief. One container contains 1520mg of sodium! They try to minimize the numbers by saying this is two servings but even then it is at 760mg of sodium (32% of your daily recommended consumption of sodium). In addition it has a really bad metal after taste even though it is packaged in a plastic container. One spoon full and it went in the garbage. Should have read the label first :-(,-1
"My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com, people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c technically you DID INJEST Cocaine, just in it's natural form.  The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.<br /><br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com",-1

When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt. I have these only because  the Roland Kalamata Pitted (whole) olives have been out of stock for couple month. As result had to dispose to trash Rolan Kalamata Halves.,-1

"It's ground up salmon bones and skin with bits of salmon still attached.  The cans we got have full pieces of fish spine.  Had to be a mistake, but no the *inside* of the can label says this is all very tasty bones and skin.  It looks like they are grinding up fish remnants after they are done steaking the fat parts of the salmon.  I'll never buy this stuff again.  Didn't even feed it to the cat.  Beware, it's marketed under different labels from the same company.",-1
"Wow, I'm a big fan of sour things but these chips might be the worst!  They are very stiff and thick, not nice and thin like a normal apple chip.  They are very firm and not chip-like.  They are more like a super dried fruit leather.  In addition, they have zero sugar or flavoring or anything and the granny smith apple flavor is intense and overpowering.  They are so sweet and bitter I can not make it through a few of these before my mouth is too puckered to continue.",-1

"I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..",-1
"THIS VILE CRUD DESERVES MINUS 50 STARS!!! I saw some negative reviews and read that this was from China, but I went ahead and tried it anyway, since everything we eat and use these days is from China and I thought it might be ok, that they might have learned a lesson and improved their product...but this stuff is vile, disgusting, foul and probably poisonous. I opened 2 cans, they both had a slight strange metallic smell, and then I took a really really really REALLY tiny taste of the stuff and immediately spit it out, its bitter, nasty and foul. I immediately called Amazon to get a refund and tossed this horrid glop into the trash. AMAZON NEEDS TO STOP SELLING THIS DREADFUL STUFF, SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE OF POISON, I FEAR!",-1
"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.

But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.",-1
"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.",-1
"These cookies, I normally like.  I ordered them from here a few months ago.  I still have five left.  I would have more, but I was forcing myself to eat them.  Even after warming them up for 15 seconds, they were still hard, and just not enjoyable.  Normally I like these cookies, but for whatever reason, when I order them off Amazon, sometimes they come to me stale.  Definitely not getting these again, as it happens most often with the Double Chocolate and the Oatmeal Raisin.",-1

The new ""formula"" has eradicated the malt nougat and replaced it with ""more chocolate.""  Quite honestly, it tastes more like a bad Tootsie roll than a Musketeers.  Too bad Mars has lousy corporate judgement...I mean, do we REALLY need more chocolate?!  Frankly, I think everyone's taste-buds are selectively jaded.  I loved the creamy nougat center, and to replace it with ""whipped chocolate"" is selling out to marketing oversell.  I won't buy them again....ever!",-1

"This used to be about the greatest thing you could buy for less than $50. Really. What other product could you purchase and credibly say, ""this is the best in the world""? Lindt 70 actually became difficult to find at the grocery stores I go to because the secret was clearly out. Now there's plenty, so Lindt screwed up the bottom line as well as on purist grounds. And for those of us with soy allergies, the change is of course a disaster, as it's practically impossible to locate chocolate or any other dessert without some form of soy. I'll spare the reader a review of the new recipe. Why bother? It tastes like every other mediocre or worse dark bar out there: waxy, non-descript, and let's face it, a little too ""American,"" like American cheese is ""American.""<br />What should we do? A great gourmet store in Ellsworth, Maine (Rooster Brother)has the right idea. I hear the owner took one bite of the new recipe and sent the entire shipment back to Lindt. Perhaps other suppliers will take up the cause. Meanwhile, here's hoping that somebody at Lindt actually cares enough about quality and distinction to put the good old stuff back into production.<br />P.S. Amazon should change the image associated w/this to reflect the New Recipe packaging, lest people think we're dissing the old stuff.",-1

My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate.

When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause.

"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust.",-1
"Of the other Lavazza coffees we've tried our opinion of them goes from very good to excellent so I did not hesitate to buy a can of Lavazza ""drip coffee"" when we needed a can of coffee in a hurry. A mistake.<br />The first thing you notice when you open the can is the color of the coffee - it's more of a cinnamon color, has an uneven course grind and looks very, very dry. After brewing a pot we found the flavor to be just awful. The flavor would best be described as sour.<br />So glad that this wasn't the first Lavazza product we'd tried as I would not have taken the chance to try the other, much more enjoyable coffees produced by them.",-1

The worst! Thick paste NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING MILDLY HOT. Gulden's brown mustard is better. Save your money. THIS IS REALLY AWFUL. You will throw it out along with your money!

"What we were hoping for:<br /><br />Something a little more like the picture.

My mistake for not reading the reviews, but I disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety.  The description says that a buyer will get a ""wide variety"" and I hardly think 3 flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as ""wide variety"".  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  If I would have bought these flavors on the Keurig website, I would have paid less per K-cup than I paid for this package... and I paid the higher price specifically for the variety.  I do not feel I got what I paid for and I think Amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising.<br /><br />Final note:  The K-cups came in a paper bag ... with no visible expiration dates.  One of them was punctured on top.  Considering some of the other reviews, I am worried about whether or not these K-cups are even good anymore.  Some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included.",-1

"About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.  RIP Ollie... :-(",-1
"This is the best I've tried.  It would be perfect if it were a bit thicker.  It gets kinda thin when heated.  I add a bit of shredded cheese to thicken it up.  Regardless, the flavor, heat, etc are excellent and far better than the Que Bueno that Costco sells (and is too thick).<br />---------------<br />Update 24 Dec 2011 - Right now the price is $36.  It used to be $24 (that's what I last paid for it according to my Amazon invoice).  A 50% increase is ridiculous.  It is good but not worth the current price.  I'm looking for an alternative.<br />---------------<br />Update 1 May 2012 - I found an excellent alternative for a bit less convenience (El Rio is still WAY overpriced at $36).  Try La Victoria Medium nacho cheese sauce.  I have only found it in 6 pound cans (at Cash and Carry in WA - probably also at Smart and Final in other places) for about $8.  La Victoria is at least as hot and the thickness does not change as it is heated.  Excellent flavor.  What I ended up doing is splitting it into freezer-type zip lock bags - roughly 14 oz each - and freezing them flat with no air inside.  They thaw in 10 minutes in the sink.  Then I clip one of the bottom corners off and squeeze out what I need and then fold the corner back up with no air and put a spring-loaded clip on it (a chip clip or binder clip works) and keep it in the fridge while I'm using it.  Opening and closing the zipper is asking for mold issues.<br /><br />I also tried vacuum sealing in glass mason jars and keeping them all in the fridge, but that didn't prevent mold.  The zip-lock bags work great and the flavor and consistency of this cheese is the best!  It is worth the repackaging effort.",-1
"I agree with the first poster---this was complete waste of money. No one in my family could eat it. It was beyond hard and tough, and I have eaten many, many brands of jerky in my lifetime. I simply cannot believe that this product got through quality assurance testing. I wish I had asked for my money back for this because it was totally justified. At any rate, I was lucky that I had tried other Trail's Best products that were excellent beforehand. If I had to judge their other products based on the quality of their ham jerky, I would never have ordered from this company again.",-1

"I have made this bread 3 times now and feel that I can, finally, write a review.  This mix is certainly not as advertised.  The first time I thought it was me...that I had done something incorrectly.  But after 2 more baking sessions, I know it is not me.  I made it in a bread machine....one that I had used for non-wheat free bread mixes.  I followed directions to the letter.  The regular breads were great...so it's not me or the machine.  This ""bread"" is really dense and very, very dry.  I cannot eat it without sloshing down plenty of liquids.  It's like eating baked cardboard.  I went to their website to see if I could get some recipes for this mix (other than ""french bread"" and ""pizza crust"") and came up with nothing.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product.  I have been using Pamela's baking mixes for a long time....not the bread mix...but this does not compare favorably with Pamela's products.

It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!",-1
"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

I read good review hope is good, i was wrong, i only able to eat 1 box out 3 box i brought, is just not good period, tasted below average, nothing too special, it does tasted like fry and very oily, very mislead.  I think the contain is not correct is far higher.  I rather eat chips than this !",-1
The bag arrived in very good condition.<br />The one star reason:<br />I was very disappointed that the bag of cracked wheat was not the coarse kind but was like very fine flour.  It is the coarse kind that gives bread the nutty texture we so love in our family.  I don't think it was advertised clearly enough for me to catch the difference but it's been awhile since I ordered it so I could have forgotten.,-1
Thus item is not worth the cost. You only get two bags of jelly beans and if it is because they are tropical flavored this is not worth it. With shipping costs it makes it worth. I suggest you find them in the store for a cost of under $3.,-1
"I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.  It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone.  I will never buy these again!!!",-1
I've used this product over the past few days and it has had no effects on my eyes.  I visited my doctor a few months back because I have a bag under one eye that only shows when I smile.

My dog was getting one of these sweet potato chicken treats a day.  She began almost immediately having irregular bowel movements and going for days without defecating.  Then she began drinking a lot of water and eating grass like crazy.  This morning she threw up.  Same symptoms as the other dogs who have had renal failure form the Kingdom Pets Premium Dog Treats.  I have thrown out the bag and hope I have caught this in time.,-1
"This item is not like any cookie I've ever met.  I am not sure what to call it.  It's large, 3 oz. and 300 calories.  It looks like a thick patty.  It is dense and chewy.  I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor.  It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee. It is only slightly sweet, and has a hint of medicinal quality.  Though listed in the ingredients, I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy, soft patty.  Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.<br /><br />If you are too busy to enjoy your food or can't taste anything anyway, maybe these are for you.  For me, when I spend 300 calories, even on the run, I want something that makes my mouth happy.  Half a whole wheat English muffin, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, half a banana sliced on top.  All around better! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky.  You'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Reformulate, Erin!  Food should be a healthy PLEASURE.",-1

"First of all, this is not the Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee you think it is. Second - the package of fake coffee from who knows where is full of contradictions. It tells a story of Caribbean mountains and breeze, and also of Hawaiian kings. So it's like Hawaii was in Caribbean.<br /><br />The coffee tastes ok, but the fact that they charge $20 for this is a rip-off + conscious false advertising says it all about the vendor.

"I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.",-1
"OK first of all there is NOTHING ass kickin about this stuff! It is only very mildly spicey; not at all what you would expect from the wonderful habanero pepper. Which brings me to my second point, trust me I know habanero and there doesn't actually seem to be any in here.  There is none of that awesome gutsy taste that I'm used to enjoying with other habanero products.  I was expecting a nice mix of sweet and at least medium heat with lots of flavor.  All this has is lots of sweet, a very mild amount of heat and basically no flavor. Would not recommend this to pepper lovers!",-1
"This is another chemistry product which has little to do with real food.  Hot...yes.  Good?  Well if hot is all there is then this is hot.  Food?  Not really.  Fine food is made directly from food and not the result of ""chemistry.""  Flavor?  Not much of any kind other than hot sensation.  I am not fan of chemistry derived food products such as this or many other which are equally synthetic.  This is completely useless to anyone with a desire for other than a hot ""free based"" oil lacking the subtleties of real food with a vast array of odors and taste which only real food has.  Hotter sensations can be purchased directly from a chemical supplier without all the bother of pretending a product of chemistry is also a food.",-1
"My 86 year old Dad is on a low sodium diet, so I am always looking foods that are easy to prepare and tasty.  I give this chili two thumbs down.

"I received this last week and was surprised that there were coffee grounds all over the amazon box.  I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged.  That being said the outside packaging looked promising, great design.  Overall I have been underwhelmed by the quality of the coffee.  It tastes old and weak.  Plus the Kcups look like they were hand done and don't have the uniformity I would expect from a professional Kcup manufacturer. I've ordered multiple different brews from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery so I'm hoping some of the next versions will be done with higher quality.  While it isn't my favorite coffee by any means it is drinkable and I'm going to try different size cups to see if I can get it to be a bit more bold and rich.<br /><br />-----UPDATE:<br />So I finally received the rest of my order Fuhgeddaboudit and Cyclone.  All of these have been less than average.  The kcup packaging is flawed in each case I received.  I also dislike all of the different coffee styles.  Each one tastes like the grounds are dry and stale.  Although I'd like to blame quality control I really think the coffee itself is just bad. Either way I will definitely not be buying coffee from this company again and I would warn everyone reading these reviews to stay away as well.  All their 5 star reviews are from people that don't have verified orders.<br /><br />I wasted my money... don't waste yours.",-1
"Having tried other instant Coffee/K-cups I'd have to say so far this is the worst attempt at French Vanilla that I have encountered. From the other reviews you either like it or dislike it and those that dislike it all have one thing in common, the ""Overwhelmingly"" artificial chemical taste. It's more like 90% Chemical, 10% Vanilla flavor and it does not taste better after a few weeks of drinking it.<br /><br />While not a k-cup, one of the better instant Vanilla brews is Nescafe's Taster Choice Vanilla packets. You'll need 2 packets of the tasters choice for the best taste, but it's a lot better tasting than this Green mountain k-cup.",-1
"..because that's what I did.  I have been to so many dermatologists to no avail. This was gross and sticky. Honestly, if you have irritated, oily skin the last thing you need is to put honey on it. I was a gross, sticky, sweaty mess. I've determined that the honey makers got together because of the decline in population of bees and concocted that honey is a cure-all.  Um, no---you just want my money.<br /><br />I intend on returning this.

"I was very excited to get some more Silver Needle Tea.  Their price was competitive but no cheap by any means.<br /><br />First complaint was the packaging the tea was packed in plastic bag and shipped with the second outer plastic bag.  Silver needle tea have beautiful fuzzy little delicate buds that should be handled with care, this was not the case.  However their handling was just a preview to the lack of quality, this tea company sells.<br />Review of the Tea.<br />Aroma: The aroma was weak when compared to other Silver needle tea I've had.<br />Appearance: there was lots of impurities. I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.  For comparison I would rate my last batch of Rishi Organic Silver needle tea an 8.5.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 8 ounces of this very disappointing.  If you are a connoisseur of this absolutely wonderful type of tea save yourself disappointment and look elsewhere.",-1

"**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.",-1

Much to my dismay, I turned each bag over to discover that they are vegan AND contain HVP or HPP (MSG).  I wasn't looking for vegan and I certainly don't want MSG.  Too bad the ""detail"" pages for these products don't contain the ingredients or I never would have ordered them.  Glad I only got 1 of each to try out.

"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,",-1

And i love perfume but this stuff was  so over the top in smell that even I didnt like it.<br /><br /> And I am the kind of person who people tease because I can never pass a perfume counter without testing everything.<br /><br />Do yourself and your cat a favor and get the expensive but recycled and biodegradable litter that is made from corn. I love that stuff. No dust and it absorbs all the odors.,-1

"I ordered based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the quality of other Kashi products I tried.  Regrettably, I was misled.  Mr. Baker's review is accurate and his 2-star rating is generous IMO.  Despite the flavorful ingredients listed on the package, this product is dry and extremely bland.  The only discernible flavor comes from the chocolate chips.",-1

"The reviews for Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning were good, the price was considerably lower than other popcorn toppings, and I thought I'd give it a try.  Well . . .

"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.",-1

"Back from vet.  Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog.  His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.  I believe it is the inside of the chew stick that made him ill, as THAT is what he threw up.  It is distinctive and hard to miss!<br /><br />Particularly if you have a SMALL dog, I would be wary of this chew stick.  I'm not saying it would upset ALL small dogs tummies, just that it is hardly mini and if my vet said it was too big for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />I have read a lot of dogs love this and did fine with it. Unfortunately mine didn't and it seems SOME other dogs (mostly smaller ones) didn't either.<br /><br />Just trying to save dog owners the worry of seeing their dog in distress and a big vet bill.",-1

"It's great if you're looking for a tea with antioxidants (found naturally in most teas) but if you're looking for a palatable fruit based one, don't buy this one. It's cheap, granted, but I was expecting actual passion fruit and orange flavors as advertised. Instead the tea tastes more like plastic when you  heat it (er think tupperware when it's been microwaved too many times). Perhaps similar to the orange juice left on the radiator? Anyway, not recommended.",-1

"We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem.",-1
"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!",-1

"My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).<br />to report your claim/problem.

What's more appalling is that people eat it and not only support the misguided notion that this is something that could be considered food, but even go so far as to say that they ENJOY eating it, AND DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS. If this product were made of meat, I would be faced with no other viable conclusion than to think that it was made from the meat products rejected by a dog-food factory. But since it is not meat of any kind, what am I to think. . . ? Is this some kind of weird joke. . . ? What IS this THING in this can? And WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

"DoNOT Buy this Water. This water used to be delicious but the have recently within the last 3 months started making changes to this water. Cheaper packaging and the water is no longer purchased from New Zealand it is actually now purchased in different parts of the US and they charge the same price at my local Whole Foods as if it was still from New Zealand. The water now tastes horrible....it tastes like it has sediment or contaminents in the water. I inquired about the change in the water and here is the email I rec'd: Although Eternal was previously sourced in New Zealand, there are many reasons for our decision to change to a US-based source.

"I wouldn't have believed it, but in Googling for a cause of the recently acquired bitter aftertaste I've been experiencing, I found an article about pine nuts causing this, and it's even being called a syndrome, which can occur a few days after consumption.  One writer suggested the culprit is pine nuts from China, which these are.  I hope the taste will be gone by Christmas, after which I hope to try making pesto again with Italian pine nuts, or see if I can find some grown closer to home.  I suppose this could be some form of allergy, but just in case, I thought other pesto enthusiasts would like to know.",-1
"I used Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner for some time before I finally wrote this review. At first, I liked it very much. I am a conditioner junkie, and will give any new product a shot if it seems to fill the bill. However, my initial delight with this conditioner sent me running back to my other conditioners when I realized that the initial softness that I felt was being replaced by a dry, brittle feeling -- almost as though I had left soap in my hair. Not good at all! Furthermore, when I gently comb through my hair when it is dry, I am suddenly experiencing breakage, and this is NOT a problem I had before I used this conditioner.<br /><br />In essence, I do not recommend this product, and I am glad that I waited long enough to have gone almost through the entire bottle so that I could be sure about my results. FYI, I always thoroughly rinse my hair out in the shower, but the residue from Clear Scalp & Hair seems almost impossible to get out.",-1
"I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as ""THICK"" bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the ""thick"" bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12"" one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.",-1

Notice that this product title starts with ""Alaskan Salmon"", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of ""Grained Salmon Caviar""  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.

The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.

"Campbells Chunky ""Healthy request"" Clam Chowder tastes horrible. It's that simple. I wouldn't eat it again if it was free, really, I wouldnt. Only thing that could save this chowder is if you added at least a Tsp or two. of salt. about a 1/4 c of heavy cream, at least 2 TBSP of butter and a 6 oz can of clams to the 18.8oz can, as this stuff is all but devoid of those three things. If you like watery, bland potato soup, this stuff is for you!<br /><br />My suggestion: Just get the real stuff, but eat less of it and you get the same calories. At least you will enjoy each bite rather than cringe and after the 3rd bite throw it out. Maybe that is their plan. Make food so bad you just throw it out and lose weight from starvation.

"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me.",-1
"Dried strawberries are smaller than most - and as another reviewer mentioned - sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />For a product that costs about $.90 an ounce, you would think that Stoneridge could've ponied up the extra $.02 per ounce for real sugar.<br /><br />In addition, they include propylene glycol (a less-toxic version of ethylene glycol, both used as antifreeze) to stop the berries from sticking to each other.  OK.... the effect of this is that they come across as ""slippery"" in your mouth, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Strange part is, the ingredient list on the package that I typed this from is different than the ingredient list of the product as listed on the Stoneridge website. Their website mentioned that they are sweetened with sucrose, for example.<br /><br />But the Stoneridge product we received from Amazon has HFCS.  And antifreeze.<br /><br />The disclaimer above says it all - ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.""<br /><br />We won't be repeat customers.",-1
"Wish I could have rated this higher.  I respect the Newmans and their philanthropy and appreciate the fact the product is premium organic ingredients.  I was looking forward to trying this 54% chocolate bar.<br /><br />I eat a little dark chocolate daily and found this was too sweet for my taste. (To be fair I have had the same problem occasionally with a couple of other brands I've tried over the years.)<br /><br />I usually buy Green & Black's 85% Dark Chocolate or Endangered Species 72% Dark Chocolate. Someone who is used to milk chocolate might like the Newman bar better than I did.<br /><br />As for comparing nutrition facts, all three bars use different portion sizes...so I didn't find it worth the effort.  Newman's 2.25 oz. bar is considered a single serving.  Green & Black's 3.5 oz bar is considered 2.5 servings, and Endangered Species 3 oz. bar is two servings.",-1
"This has got to be the worst tasting houji I have ever consumed in all my years of drinking it. Houji is my favorite tea, and have tried many different brands, and this one is by far the worst. Upon opening the packaging for the tea bags I received the most stale smelling tea aroma of any tea I've ever purchased. After brewing for 10 minutes (which is longer than normal), the color of the tea was a very very pale brown, almost looked mucky. Houji should turn the water a vibrant amber color, this did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to a tea novice or expert. If you want true quality, import straight from Japan, as it is a Japanese tea. However, one of the better tasting houji teas I have tasted is Yamamotoyama Roasted Green Tea Houjicha, and it can be purchased on this website. If you cannot afford, or do not want to spend a lot of money on quality tea, Yamamotoyama is your best bet.<br /><br />Hopefully you found this useful!",-1

"I bought the Soup Bones thinking that they would be a great treat for my dogs, a 70lb german shorthaired pointer and a 14lb shitzu. Several hours after eating them, my pointer had a rumbly stomach that was so loud I could hear it and she was rolling around, obviously uncomfortable. My shitzu started vomiting and had terrible diahrrea. He did not eat for a full day and threw up everything, even the water he drank. He was a very sick little dog! It was sad to see my dogs so miserable because of something I had given them. I do not reccommend giving these to your dog!",-1

"This is my first review on Amazon.  My daughter has been enjoying these pouches since she was 6 months old and eating solid food.  I used to buy them at a retail store, but switched to Amazon a few months ago when my local store stopped carrying them.  This review in no way has anything to do with the contents of the pouches at all, these are great foods for infants and great snacks for toddlers.<br /><br />My review is to alert consumers to a bug infestation I got because of the packaging these items come in.  Soon after getting these from Amazon, I started finding miller bugs in my pantry.  I would clean out my whole pantry and remove them only to have the problem recur and worsen.  I finally identified the source as these pouches!  They come in a pack of 6 and the last two shipments I have recieved have definitively without any doubt had eggs of these miller bugs in them, the last batch of which I watched hatch into disgusting maggots as confirmation that I had identified the source correctly.  I would never write this if it was not true, buyer beware!  I now have a huge problem with these bugs and I am having difficulty getting rid of them.  I have cancelled my subscriptions so I will no longer introduce new eggs into my pantry every month!",-1

Others have mentioned that EVO works for them, I guess I will try that. I have also tried ACANA and ORIJEN with no success.

"I had read the previous review about the person getting sick because of the product being past it's expiration date, but ordered anyway, thinking surely Amazon wouldn't ship out of date products again.  Well they did.  The product is two years past the expiration date and the bottle looks nothing like the description.  I called and Amazon is sending a replacement.  I asked that they make sure the date is okay and they said they would.  We'll see.<br /><br />I just received the replacement order and it is exactly the same as the previous, still past the expiration date by two years.  Called Amazon and they said they would pull the remaining items off the shelf.  Do not order this product.",-1
"A wonderful set, but let me get straight to the point.<br /><br />TWICE, not once, but TWICE my family ordered this product, presuming that it would arrive intact. Unfortunately, TWICE we discovered that the body lotion in the first shipment had been punctured andan 1/4 of the product ALREADY USED.<br /><br />In the second shipment, the body lotion AND the shower gel had been punctured and 1/4 used.<br /><br />This not only is a huge disappointment in quality control, but a hygienic issue. Frankly, it is disgusting to think that someone had dipped their fingers into body lotion and shower gel previously, and then nicely wrapped up the package as if nothing was wrong.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed at 'Art of Appreciation's complete lack of Quality Control. I am NEVER buying from them again.",-1

"This was an exciting purchase, until i make the first cup. All it does is push out the powder into the cup and then in runs clear the rest of the brew cycle. For $9.99 they should put this in a canister and quadruple the quantity.  The flavor was kinda bland too. I prefer a different product thats sold on amazon",-1
"I'm not sure how or why this soup mix is getting such good reviews. It has no flavor whatsoever. When they dehydrated the ingredients they pulled all the flavor out. I've tried everything to make a decent dish with this stuff, but always turns out bland and tasteless.<br /><br />The recommend mix is also WAY off (4 cups water / mix)...you'll end up with a lintel sludge that is nothing like soup. I think I could probably calk my bathroom with it or make a nice adobe hut however.<br /><br />If you are into very bland food this will probably be good. If you like flavor stay away.",-1
"This cheese is best described as solidified sour cream with a faint hint of blu.<br /><br />I tried to like it and feel around for the flavor, but the sour cream taste overpowers whatever the unique flavor of the mold might have.  After separating the vein alone and trying that it tastes musty but not in a good way to me.  Those that say this is the best cheese they tried should give gorgonzola a shot for the title.",-1
This juice was very good but they spoiled it by acai berry. It now is brown in color and tastes awful. I would buy it only if they changed it back and removed the acai berry.,-1
"""Blends smooth and creamy for a sweet tasting protein""  is in the item description. I don't know who wrote this but they must not have ever smelled or tasted this stuff! Based on the description, I purchased a few of these bags. They come vacuum sealed. The color of the powder is a light olive green. The taste is a combination of powdered sawdust, wheatgrass and every dark green health food store drink you've ever had. The only reason it gave it a star at all is well, there's no choice for zero, and it probably does have decent nutritional properties. But while forcing myself to drink this stuff, I got flashbacks from 3 years old when I was forced to eat spinach. The good news is Amazon refunded the cost of the purchase even though it's a ""non-refundable"" product. You have to call them to do it. They didn't even want me to send back the unopened bags! But I really want to return them. It seems a shame to have to throw them away.",-1
"I bought a packet of this from my local Thai market today and was very excited to try it. I grilled some beef, cut it into strips, put the seasoning over it and then added shallots and cilantro and a little lime. It just tasted like slightly spicy lime with ground toasted rice.

I hadn't used cacao nibs before, so I figured this was just what they were like. Not the case! I went to Nuts.com to purchase some items for a trail mix and saw they had a sample pack of their own Cacao nibs for $2.50 (not sure on size, but it's lasted me awhile; I want to say the package holds about 4 oz). I ordered them with everything else and they are HEAVEN compared to the Navitas. They smell fresh, they taste fresh, and I've been using them in just about everything (about done with the sample pack, sadly!). They are also CHEAPER!! $12.99/lb. I haven't touched the Navitas since and actually just tossed the entire bag (sad to waste the money) out.",-1
I agree with the previous reviews. I bought this believing Kikkoman to be a reliable brand name and was horrifically wrong. It smelled like a mustard sauce as soon as I opened it and I too thought that cooking it would alter/improve the flavor.

I bought two bottles and, with each, spent about 45 minutes spraying the lawn while getting eaten by mosquitoes before realizing that not a single drop of teh active ingredients were actually getting dispensed out the hose.  Fortunately I had an older bottle with a better dispenser and used that bottle to spray.  Unfortunately, that dispenser eventually fell apart, and when I needed a new bottle, I was back with the latest dispenser.  For this third bottle, the entire dispenser blew up in my face when I turned on the nozzle, so I got the chemical in my eyes, my mouth, my hair, everywhere.  Absolute POS.

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>It took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this.  First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.",-1

I ramped up the dosage, or the snortage.  Hey, I felt something! But it wasn't enery.  It was my sinuses becoming pretty irritated and the dripping down the back of my throat.

"I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.",0
"Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.

Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.",0

"Generally I buy olive oil in large 2 liter containers because we use in for cooking, baking and just about anything that asks for lard or butter.  We feel using olive oil is a far healthier and tastier souce of oil to use than the latter.  However, when I started researching more and hearing stories of outdated olive oil and needing to have it in a dark container I became worried about where I get my olive Oil... Generally at Sams Club or Costco....  So I opted to spend a few extra bucks more to get it in a dark bottle and hopefully current year stock.  I purchased this lovely Bariani EVOO and it looked and smelled great, but honestly it didn't taste any different than the EVOO that I get elsewhere and the date on the bottle was confusing.... harvested in 2010 and bottled in 2011?  Since I just purchased it September 2011 I was trying to figure out why. So, I contacted the company that produces this oil hoping to get some clarification on the details (since olive oil does not improve with age) and never heard back from them.  So now I won't bother spending the extra money on that product.  I did buy their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WK3F9Q"">Bariani Balsamic Vinegar 16.9 oz.</a> and that is superb, but again sine I never heard from the company, why should I buy from them again?  Disappointed!<br /><br />UPDATE----- Since the Bariani company did not respond I contacted a reputable California company ""Calolea"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IUSIFO"">Calolea California Mission Blend Extra Virgin Olive Oil 500 Ml</a>and they offered this informative response:<br /><br />Olives are harvested here in California between late October thru the middle of January.  It takes some time to do all of the blending and bottling so the oil doesn't usually hit the stores until after the new year.  So it is normal that oils made in 2010 come out in 2011.<br />As to what makes oils extra virgin, it is a reference to how much free fatty acid is present in the oil.  The international standard is .08% of free fatty acid.  The California standard is .05%.  Our olive oil is usually between .01 to .02% so well below the definition of extra virgin.  We accomplish this by picking and pressing within 24 hours. Olive oil does not get better with age!  You should try to get oils that are fresh and use it quickly.  Some companies come out with Olio Nuevo, new oil, during and right after harvest, this is when the oil is at its best but beware because sometimes it is very strong.",0
"The product is good, not too sweet.<br />OValley has been able to maintain their quality. They products taste better than Horizon. My kids love vanilla, strawberry, chocolate. Its useful while travelling, an emergency snack in the car.<br /><br />I do find it expensive at 15.99 .... recently i got the chocolate flavor at costco for $6.<br />The other thing i did not like was that Amazon sent me a pack of milk with an expiry date of April 24. THis was at the at end of Feb/the beginning of march. I expected a fresh product .... that is why i cancelled the subscription too.",0
I have been eating these for approximately one year.  The Orange Smoothie is my favorite flavor.  In the past I have been able to purchase at Costco warehouse but have unable to find in the last few months.  I turned to Amazon.  I ordered 10 boxes so I wouldn't run out any time soon.  That was a mistake on my part.  The product came stale and hard to eat.  I should have returned as it turned out all ten boxes were bad.  (I opened each box searching for a fresh one.)  Will try to find another vendor for these.,0
I bought those in Austria and the where awesome But the one i ordert where hard and old,0
"I love the taste of these bars, but the poops always come within 30 minutes of eating just one.  It's not just poops, but crazy poops.  Still... I eat them, but I make sure I am alone at home and near a bathroom.  Those who aren't effected must have intestines of steel.  Co-workers and I were speaking about these bars this afternoon.  I'd asked if any of them had ever eaten them and, if so, what kind of side-effects resulted.  After all the embarrassed smiles and giggles, I didn't have to ask further.  Maybe they could reduce the fiber just a little?  Otherwise, the Chocolate Peanut Butter is the best.",0
"Tastes a little like bananas, so be prepared for that. Not as light as I would want for the gym, but a good 'before the gym' kind of filling drink. Can't say that my skin is firmer or I look any better, but I think it gave me some good energy.",0
"This would be wonderful if it didn't have Splenda in it.  Even my husband, who uses Splenda, says they put too much in it, so it is too sweet.  I contacted the company about it, and they said they only make it with Splenda.  It's too bad, b/c it tastes great, except for the Splenda.",0
so I mix them together and the result is very pleasing.<br />on its own I am not too keen on the flavour..<br />so I always mix and match along the way with teas which are not as appetising as some.. I just don't want to waste them.. and I do drink a lot of organic herbal teas..,0
"As far as taste goes, this is by far my favorite cereal, but despite the whole grain (very little apparently), it has very little fiber (zero,actually, according to the box itself), so I usually don't eat it.  Too bad.",0
"These Emerald Forest Xylitol Wintermints may meet your needs or may not. I tried them out because I was looking for a xylitol mint (for the dental/gum health benefits) that had xylitol as its primary ingredient. These fit the bill. They are moderately sweet but very mild on the mint side. The drawbacks for me are that they are very small and dissolve very quickly. I usually pop at least two at once because they are small, and they dissolve in the matter of a minute. If you are looking for a strong flavored mint that lasts more than a minute, these are not what you are looking for.",0
I enjoyed this coffe quite a bit but I can not say I enjoyed it any more than any other good quality K-cup coffees available at a much lower price. Doesn't seem to taste the same as in-store brewed.,0
"These 12 oz bags are being sold at TJ Max for 5.99, and I bought two. Just tasted my first brew... Like another reviewer said, this is not the typical flavor offered from the dark selection like french roast, sumatra, etc. It's a different sensation, one I'll have to get used to because I have two bags. It still has that strong burnt-like roast taste but with different undertones. Taste is subjective. You may like it. For me, it's not an instant hit!",0
"Halloween 2012. I refuse to be one of the houses that gives off-brand Laffy Taffy or candy corn (seriously, who likes candy corn!), so I ordered 2 bags of these assorted Hershey's chocolates. Arrived in 2 days(paid $12.77 for each bag, shipped free with amazon prime).<br /><br />Arrived at my front door in about 80°F weather, opened the box up, and, worried that they had melted, opened one of the bags up to check it's condition.<br /><br />It was a chocolate holocaust.<br /><br />I'd say 60% of the chocolate was either liquid or partially liquid (some had started to reharden). I felt like Oscar Schindler as I tried to salvage as many of them as I could by throwing them in the freezer. My heart wept at the sight of this choco-carnage, truly this was an existential moment.<br /><br />Breakdown (1 bag):<br />Kit-Kat: 13. Wafer was intact, the exterior chocolate coating was all/partially melted. After freezing: outer chocolate hardened, good enough condition for halloween.<br /><br />Hershey Bars: 21. Most of the hershey bars had gotten squished during delivery, they were all partially melted/deformed. After freezing: the chocolate hardened, but you could tell they had at some point melted... I'll save these for kids who put no effort into their costumes.<br /><br />Reese's Cups: 17. These were by far the worst, all had melted and partially re-hardened, they were disfigured as though they'd been dragged through an Auschwitz concentration camp. I can only imagine the sort of torture they must have gone through. These were not fit for human consumption. Tears streamed down my face as I stuffed my face full of Reese's cups. I gave them a soldier's death.<br /><br />Whoppers- 52. Upon refreezing, they were in decent enough condition that I could probably give them out on Halloween. But there were so many... these will go to the kids who are far too old to be Trick-or-Treating.<br /><br />OVERALL: order if you need bulk Halloween candy or if you enjoy Whoppers... you could honestly get an equivalent amount of unmelted candy from your local Wal-Mart, I probably didn't save much money getting it from Amazon. And if you live in a hot place, chances are it will melt.",0
"I don't like it, maybe others know how to brew it to make it perfect",0
I have no complaints about the quality of this tea it is very good. My only complaint is that I do think it is<br />completely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.<br />I am always on the look out for something tea-like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas/coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine-free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is  made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.,0
"This is not why I gave it 3 stars- that's below- I probably should have done more research before ordering. I was in a bit of a rush though after seeing them use cardamom on Top Chef so I just ordered the best deal I could find. Turns out these Green Cardamom are used in drinks, like teas. If you want to use as a spice get the Black Cardamom which is much more pricey.<br />Still, had I known what I was doing, I would still only give 3 stars. As described it does take over a month to get these, they are shipped from India they say, however even by boat a month seems long. If you think you'll get them sooner than what they say...don't count on it.<br />The main reason for the 3 stars though, is because inside the green pods(hence the name) are supposed to be a clumop of little black seeds. Well over 60% of the pods I got had clumps of little tan seeds. Not sure if they weren't ripe or just weren't cardamom. I do know that there are a lot of fake products out there, and with such a high percentage of the wrong color seeds, it made me doubt the entire delivery.<br />With that doubt I can't justify a better rating. My advice for prople looking for Green Cardamom: Do some research, know what you want, and test different suppliers by ordering small batches until you find one that gives you all green pods that are all filled with black seeds.",0
"I wish I had noticed the other reviewer. The ""handle"" is straight and flat. You can't easily hold onto the handle and open with one hand, then season with the other hand. The handle needs to be looped or curved. Know that before you buy.",0
"This coffee smelled great, but the taste was less impressive.  It wasn't that the coffee was too bitter or strong, it was that the taste was sort of blah.  There was nothing remarkable about the flavor, it really was quite boring, if one can call a coffee boring.  This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.  If it tasted like it smelled it would have been so much better.",0
"This was my first time eating dates, so I've nothing to compare them to, but what I can say about them is that they're mildly sweet, but a little drier than I expected. They work fine as an ingredient, but I don't think they're good to snack on or eat plain.",0
"I have to write a review in order to get this off my 'Vine Voice' list.  I never recieved the free sample.  According to the tracking number, it ended up being delivered to the wrong town.",0
"This coffee is a bit bitter, and the flavoring is sort of... muddled. ""Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie"" seems like an extravagant name for a sort-of spicy flavor, even if it is a nice flavor. There's also a fair amount of fine dust, so if you don't have a very fine filter, you'll find it floating in your coffee. I enjoyed the coffee well enough, but would buy something else next time.",0
"This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food, and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.",0
"I'm a big fan of Weruva cat food, but my cats weren't thrilled with this particular flavor. They ate most of it, but didn't ""dig in"" like they usually do - just kind of picked at it. The dog, on the other hand, was more than happy to finish it off for them. I must admit that I was kind of glad when they didn't wolf it down, because it definitely smells very fishy and I was happy that I wouldn't have to buy it again! :)",0
"We have been using these for our son for over a year now. It seems recently that the quality has gone down hill. These feel a bit too watery now. I've tried a few batches from local store to compare if this was a one time thing. Looks like they all are the same watery kind now. I've compared this to other flavors, and seems like this is the only flavor that has this problem. All other flavors are still the same good quality.<br /><br />Manufacturer : Please don't try and fix something that's not broken.",0
The pass review mentioned that the 5g saffron came in each gram with separated pack and put into one acrylic box. The product I received is all 5g saffron in one plastic bag put inside the acrylic box.,0
"I paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister, and it turns out it arrived more than a day late. That's unacceptable to me.",0
"These beans arrived having been very freshly roasted and with excellent aroma.  I brew in a French press and that first cup was excellent indeed- being a 5-star in flavor and at perhaps 4 on the aroma.  It did posses a rather surprising bitterness in the aftertaste but nothing that took anything significant away from the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I have essentially finished the 5-pound bag now, and the enjoyment of that first cup continues at the same level as the first brew.  Unfortunately, my own style is to drink the coffee over the morning hours, and I normally do so by warming individual refills in the microwave.  After that  first excellent one, subsequent rewarmed  cups of this product, while a problem with many beans, drop off in quality faster than any other beans I have tried (of course, some start bad and stay bad). For that reason only- and admittedly my own habit that may not match yours- I drop this product to about 3 stars- it is a very steep drop in quality after that first cup.<br /><br />I have no idea how this might show itself using other brewing and serving methods.  I suspect that in any environment that does not require rewarming or perhaps held at temperature for longer periods, this is most definitely a 5-star candidate.  Its oiliness might possibly be a bit of a nuisance for some machines.<br /><br />Since I have found a few others that do hold their flavor extremely well after brewing and submit to rewarming quite well, I won't be using this one again.  If you are a re-warmer, I would try something else. However, I think that if you can avoid the heat cycling you should definitely consider giving in giving this one a try.",0
"This looks like a ""good for you"" product, what with the honey and green tea and acai and all, but I was disappointed to find sucralose (artificial sweetener) on the ingredients list. I love the convenience of having a tube of powder to pour into my water bottle and shake... and I did like the taste, but I probably won't be buying more because of the sucralose.",0
"Wow this is pricey, not to worth it considering the lack of recipes you can use this with the video only has 3 recipes that use popping sugar. You're better off buying Pop Rocks the candy, its way cheaper to be honest.",0
"I bought the 6 pack of these mixes and was really excited that they turned out so well in my bread machine.  The bread tastes amazing, but about 2 hours later the problems start.  Myself and everyone who has tried it has developed severe bloating and gas that lasts about 12 hours.  I think it may be from the sorghum flour, as I don't have any intolerances to eggs, milk, etc and neither do my family members.  I also tried making the pizza crust, which also tastes very good, but results in the same effects.",0
Concerned as I have not seen any more blossoms since its arrival. Lots of green leaves.,0
"Deceptive title!  Did not receive an 8 pack, only received one pouch.  Someone needs to revise the title so as not to mislead consumers.  Have yet to feed this very expensive meal to my daughter so I cannot comment on the flavor, but we love happy baby products in general.",0
Very disappointed.  Item had obviously gotten too hot at some point.  All of the capsules were stuck together.  I had to cut the bottle open to pull the apart.,0
"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",0
I picked up a box of Betty Crockers Mac and Cheese:Cheese Pizza at a local supermarket for about 79 cents. The cooking directions threw me off a bit but it was easy enough to prepare. Even after simmering for 12 minutes the pasta was a little firm for my taste. The flavor of the pasta was more or less what you would expect from boxed macaroni and cheese but with some garlic notes an not much else.,0
"The merchant claims that the list price of this item is $85.05.  I guess we should be thankful that they are giving us 58% discount.  I don't know where they get the figure $85.05 but nobody sells this water for $3.54 for a bottle, not even a high-end restaurant.  I think they are just jacking up the price to give you the illusion that you are getting a discount.  Deceptive marketing technique.",0
"I ordered the 50-""dose"" Starbucks VIA coffee from Amazon rather than direct from Starbucks, saving money and getting fast, free  delivery. I like the Italian Roast, and recommend it.",0
"While I'm a big coffee drinker, I'm no fan of Starbucks in-home brews. That being said, I work at a firm where they order Starbucks' French and Breakfast blends, but I order in my own instant NesCafe Clasico. I ordered Puroast's this time, but it tastes the same as the bitter ones, seems a bit acidic for being ""Low Acid,"" and leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />I actually had to mix it in with some creamers (Coffeemate's French and regular). To me, it's as though I were drinking Starbucks' versions, so I see no difference.",0
"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",0
"I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.",0
"These are tasty but not nearly as good as the ""Original Wild"" flavor. They were also quite stale when they got to me.",0
"The green color is a bit weird, and it does have a funny flavor but it works. Taking this product has improved my recovery time and I like that it is vegan. The added fiber is an added bonus. To get the same amount of protein as Soy I have to eat more of it but mixed with almond or hemp milk it is quite drinkable. Some of it is grainy and needs to be mixed well but it does not clump like soy protein and is easy to digest. No added sugar or additives, just protein and fiber. Pretty good mix but you have to be careful what you mix it with. Just mix it according to the directions on the bottle (use almond milk) and you will have no problems. Makes a good after workout snack.",0
"I was a little disappointed in this product.  I bought it for my husband who has diabetes but who loves dark chocolate.  It tasted bland to both of us.  For the price I was expecting a bit of a ""gourmet"" taste, a chocolate with a smooth, creamy melt.  This chocolate tasted a bit gritty and was neither smooth nor creamy.<br /><br />What I did like was that the vendor enclosed a chemical pack with the shipment that kept the chocolate cool enough despite the summer heat.  This chemical pack prevented the chocolate from arriving in a brown, mushy package.",0
"Received 24 packets of cat food - quantity was unclear in advertising.<br />The packaging protected against damage as if the packets were crystal glassware.<br />The shipping cost was too high for the amount of product received.<br />My cat loves it, so I will find some alternative to keep a supply.",0
"I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts.",0
"This shampoo claims that it will, ""give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days.""<br />I completed this try out  and really have not noticed any difference between the results of it and several other shampoos that I use that are on the lower end of the price scale.<br /><br />The shampoo is extremely thick and creamy - so much so that I spent twice as long rinsing it out as any other shampoo I have used.<br />My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and seems to be becoming more delicate the older I get; so I will say that this did not damage or seem to be harmful in any way. In fact I had gotten sunburn on my scalp in the part of my hair and this felt very gentle on that tender spot. So if the price suits you, it would be okay.",0
"These are really stinky.  Not a problem as far as the dog is concerned; most dogs would be hard pressed to decide if they wanted to eat or roll in four day old road kill, after all. I, however, am thanking my lucky stars I have an airproof tin tub to store these treats in.  The strips are also irregularly sized and shaped.  Again, the dog doesn't seem to mind, but, given the smell, I would prefer not to have to poke thru the bag looking for a large piece when I want to keep the dog occupied for a while.  I assume the dog would give these a five star rating; I give them only a three.",0
"I buy this brand at the supermarket so I thought this would be a good alternative to retail prices, but.... every single can was dented! Badly!<br />I don't buy dented cans when I do my regular shopping. I was very disappointed that  they would pack and ship dented cans because the outer packaging was intact so it's not the carrier's fault.",0

"Timothy's Rainforest Decaf Espresso is full bodied, strong without being bitter or biting as espresso can be and decaffinated!!

"This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable.",0
"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",0
"It has a light scent, it washes out well, and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I didn't notice if it made a difference on my scalp, but it didn't dry it out either.  The consistency is creamy, not oily, and it doesn't seem to weigh my hair down.  This stuff seems to hurt more if it gets near my eyes, then other conditioners do.  I like it, but I won't order it again.  It lived up to its promises, but I just wasn't thrilled over it.  I will stick to my regular shampoo and conditioner.",0
"We have been buying this product for several years but at pet store or vets.This was first time ordered on line and had shipped. Each bag the pockets were wet/slimy upon opening and not sure if that was their original shipment condition or from sitting in my hot Florida mailbox till I get home. Of course the dogs could care less but they broke apart easliy as if all the mushy flexibility had leaked out and made them wet. So in trying to close the end over this giant capsule..., even in the large size, made pieces break off and made this mom a mess. were not expired or anything o/w good shipping and communication.",0
There is really no grilled taste to the chicken which is disappointing.  Good texture not alot of chicken flavor to the meat so it needs spices.  The peices are nice size for wraps and stir frys.,0
"There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.",0
"The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.",0
Every thing came thru OK.  Except that the lid on one bottle was a little lose and the bottle leaked in shipping.,0

I too am disappointed by the changes made recently to Orgain. This was a great product. Now I struggle to get through it. I actually sent an email to the company. I hope they change it back.,0
I have this in applesauce or rice pudding or something like that almost every night.  I bought it because they said it could help your cholesterol levels.  That remains to be seen.  When I get my next check-up we will see.  It tastes very sweet even when mixed.,0
"Good enough for pre-popped I guess. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I miss that ""fresh popped"" taste. The ""lite"" moniker should not scare away those that like buttery flavor, though-- this popcorn is actually rather buttered/salted by my standards. Nice that it's organic (must for us), but as mentioned, nothing beats popping your own, though it's nice to not have to deal with the unpopped kernels (I have yet to find any kernels in the 3 bags we've eaten thus far).",0
"Great product, my dogs (Collies) both LOVE these snacks.  With that said, I had been buying the Wrapped Biscuits from BJs for $9.99, BJs ran out so I bought them on line for over $25.00 almost 3 times as much so like I said great product but way over priced at Amazon.com",0
"While it seems strange to consider candy ""in season,"" that is how holiday candy generally is.  I purchased this Autumn Mix well after Halloween, and the result was stale.  That worked, because I was melting them down for a recipe.  However, they were not very good on their own.  As is, I would rate them 3 stars.<br /><br />However, when I buy this mix locally in Fall, it is creamy and has a nice taste of honey.  It is a great product and I would rate it 4 stars, because as great as it is, it is not quite what it used to be and tastes more artificial.<br /><br />Given that I can fairly only rate what I was sent, I will rate these 3 stars, but if purchased in season, they make both a nice Fall treat and a nostalgic decoration.  If they are sold where you live, which is likely in the Fall, I suggest shopping around.  They tend to be much more expensive online.",0
"This pancake mix is ok. It makes very fluffy pancakes, the problem it they aren't really yummy.  It's not a bad mix if you dress them up by adding fruit or something else, but I found by themselves the pancakes are a little bland.",0
"These were very tender, but too salty for my taste. They weren't as salty as the Teriyaki ones though.. :d<br />I really LOVED Buffalo Bills Dead Meat jerkies so I thought I give these a try.. but I think I'll stick to the ones I love :)",0
The coffee renders smooth flavor and mild aroma which is justifiably fair for its price. Use it for daily fix is fine but not for a real special occasion.,0
"Since I, like most people, suffer from dry skin in the winter, I decided to try an olive soap.  It does leave your skin squeeky clean with no soap scum residue.  The bar last a long time too. However, I still feel like I need to apply a moisturizer after.  I was hoping to eliminate that need. I may try Olivella's moisturizer.<br /><br />I would recommend this soap but you may want to consider adding the moisturizer to your cart too!",0
"We have been buying this product for several years but at pet store or vets.This was first time ordered on line and had shipped. Each bag the pockets were wet/slimy upon opening and not sure if that was their original shipment condition or from sitting in my hot Florida mailbox till I get home. Of course the dogs could care less but they broke apart easliy as if all the mushy flexibility had leaked out and made them wet. So in trying to close the end over this giant capsule..., even in the large size, made pieces break off and made this mom a mess. were not expired or anything o/w good shipping and communication.",0
"The ingredients and ease of preparation are great, but it's just too bland. To me, it's inedible without adding salt and hot peppers of some sort.  I didn't have a problem with the texture, and the ingredients are great.  But I can't recommend it because of the underwhelming taste.",0
"Generally I buy frozen and not canned artichokes, so this may explain why I did not care for this product. It sort of squeaks in your mouth. In addition, there are quite a few tough parts included. Edible, not great.",0
"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.",0
"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first.",0
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:43 Mins<br /><br /></span>After experimenting with grocery store-type dog foods I settled on one sold by my vet. However, I thought that this brand might be worth trying.  You will see from my video review that not all dogs are fond of it.  I thought that it was just okay and the ingredient list is not very impressive.  I hope that you enjoy my video.",0
"I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.<br /><br />Zico, however, is form concentrate.  Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One.",0
"I bought this variety pack to go with the coffee maker I purchased as a gift.  The variety I received was decent, but I was totally unimpressed when I opened the shipping box and found that the coffee assortment was packaged in an unlabeled plain, brown paper bag.  I thought the assortment would at least come in a labeled box of some sort, but the samples were literally stuffed in a bag with the top bunched up like a brown bag lunch.  It literally looked like someone just tossed 24 random coffees in a bag and threw it in a shipping box.  Not the best for gift-giving.  I thought that was pretty tacky, especially for the price.",0
"IMHO... One of the biggest let-downs in the Gloria Jean's flavored coffee category is Butter Toffee. While this brew hints at toffee flavor, it is significantly weaker than other manufacturer's flavors.<br /><br />LUCKILY.....<br /><br />you can sell, give, or trade your unwanted k-cups at the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo Groups (Amazon prevents me from listing the site's address here, but you'll find it if you go on Yahoo Groups and search for K-Cup Exchange) This site is a great idea for K-Cup users. You can find excellent brewing info and hear about REAL specials on K-Cups.",0
This is a very mild coffee.  I like the Green Mountain Coffee brand but if you are a coffee connosieur this is not for you.,0
"Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.  I don't have a pod coffee machine and so I initially thought that I could use these pods much like you would a tea bag.  I steeped it in my boiling water and then smelled the rich aroma and gulped down murky flavored fiery hot water.  It was bland and unappealing.  I've read that you can empty the contents into a conventional coffee machine and use it that way, but it would take a lot of pods to equal out a pot of coffee, and I don't have a conventional coffee maker so that wouldn't help me much.  I actually snatched this up because I thought I could make this like tea, and I wouldn't need a coffee maker.  It smells amazing, but like some other reviewers here, the pod process is a bit of a stumbling block.  I know that they make coffee makers specifically for these pods, but I can't see myself rushing out to buy one.  Just be aware before you buy that this may not be what you are bargaining for.  I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.  Coffee is a great flavoring tool, and so I actually like these pods for that.  I recently cut one of these pods open and crusted pork with the contents.  It was wonderful.",0
Nice packing but only 3 months before the boxes expire.  I bought 2 of these cause i loved it but now we have to eat 24 boxes in 3 months time.!!!!  Not too happy with that and Amazon should maybe post some expiration dates for their food items they sell.,0
"I don't know what I expected.  Coffee pod systems all seem to be geared to someone who prefers weaker coffee than me.  I can reduce the water, but then I get a smaller cup of coffee and it starts being less cost effective.  Plus, the Senseo coffees (both medium and dark roast) are bitter.  These aren't horrible, just mediocre, and they do have caffeine in them and are quick and convenient, so 3 stars.",0
"Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...",0
"I've tried about 5 flavors and this is my least favorite.  I like the organic ingredients so feel good about giving them to my kids but even they nor my husband liked this flavor.  Weird spice combination.  I like the texture, however, and these were much less sticky than the cherry ones we received.<br /><br />The redeeming quality is the nutritional, natural ingredients and health value.  We'll finish them off but then replace them with apricot ones! =)",0
"If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! ""You can't eat just one!""<br />It contains MSG and other ""stuff."" - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though...",0
They arrived in a large baggie (very thin like a produce bag from grocery store). The seeds were heavily salted with each seed encrusted in a thick chunky layer of powdered salt. Will NEVER buy this product from this supplier again!SEVERLY DISAPPOINTED!,0
My wife and kids liked them more than I.  I would have preferred a bit crisper/drier for being roasted.  Flavor is good and they were fresh.,0
"I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!!",0
"These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.",0
I love them and my kids love them. We make them at home occasionally for a special treat and there is just no replacement for a chocolate bar. They are also great in the freezer. Just all around a good item to keep in your pantry!,0
This cornbread is not as sweet as I would like.  I used paper muffin cups when I made it and half the muffin stuck to the paper so that was a bummer.  I think I like my mom's homemade GF cornbread better.,0
"I'm actually doing what I am critical of others for doing. . . I am rating downward a star because of Amazon's price, not the product. The Lifesavers are wonderful.  Period.  Especially the pineapple! However, the price at Amazon is .12 an ounce higher than Wal-Mart (as of this date). A 41 oz. package of these at Wal-Mart was $6.98, or .17 an ounce and from Amazon they are .29 an ounce. I wish I'd gone to Wal-Mart before ordering these. . . Though I am still the most devoted of Amazon customers, the prices are definitely trending upward and no longer is Amazon automatically the least expensive option. I will have to do due diligence in the future.",0
For some reason these seeds did not agree with me.  I wish for something with some flavor but these won't work for me.,0
"These granola bars with peanut butter mini-chips, a drizzle of chocolate over the grain, and a bottom layer of chocolate taste good.  It is a touch sweet and the chocolate isn't very strong compared to the peanut butter flavor but it has a good amount of whole grains and those are decently crunchy but not hard.  Nutritionally they are good, too, with an acceptable amount of fiber, protein, sugar, and calories for this type of product.<br /><br />But this is not better than several other cereal, fiber, or granola bars I've tried in the past.<br /><br />It could easily have more fiber in it or even less sugar so why it does not, I'm sure especially when this is part of the Special K family that promotes itself as a good way to lose weight.  These could do this and still have more chocolate, too.  Look at the Fiber Plus bars or the Fiber One bars for an example of a better product.<br /><br />This is certainly better than grabbing a plain granola bar or a candy bar but it does not meet the nutritional vales or the taste values of other similar bars.",0
"I expected a lot from these beans after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I expected a rich, flavorful espresso bean. These beans appear to be under roasted. They are very light in appearance and don't have any of the customary oil that I find thinly coating other quality coffee beans. I still gave them a try, and the resulting brew did taste better than expected, but was nothing to write home about. They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.<br /><br />I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable.",0
"Udis is by far the best gluten free bread on the market, in my opinion. At over $5 per loaf in the stores, the cost of this case isn't bad, but be prepared to wait a while for shipment. I've ordered this twice, and each time it has taken almost 2 weeks to get to me. The bread stays fresh, but sometimes, it's easier just to go to the store.",0
"I am in agreement with several of the users.  I can buy any of these flavors for 4.99 online, at the manufactures website.  Why would I pay 8.99 to 13.99 for the same.  This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.",0
"I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.",0
"I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar ""Aspartame"" flavored products. However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water. If you still want an all-natural drink mix that is less expensive, take a look at the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade. The product link is below.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XG2H94"">True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade Drink Mix, 10-count (Pack of 6)</a>",0
"I bought a couple of packs of the decaf and the expiration date was further out to March 2013.  When Starbucks has them (all flavors) on sale for around $25 shipped, I bought a pack of the Italian Roast.  I was disappointed that this package received will expired November 27, 2012.  I was hope to have a further date because I don't drink them everyday.  Emailed Starbucks and they said products still good 75 days past expiration date and if I don't want it, return for full refund.  Amazon do not have a return policy on food items and Starbucks didn't offer to refund my shipping this item back to them.  I just have to take their words for it and keep the package.  Sending it back at my expense isn't worth the hassle.<br /><br />I think I shouldn't worry about expiration dates so close but if Starbucks drop the prices, you know they're getting rid of expire soon coffees.  I probably buy at local Costco next time.",0
"What a bummer that is item is no longer available with the Subscribe and Save program, that's really going to hurt my pocket book!  Please bring it back Amazon!!!",0
"I'm not sure exactly what this drink is supposed to be so I probably wouldn't tell my friends about it. It is made by Maxwell House and says that it is a cafe style beverage mix. What kind of drink, i'm not sure.<br /><br />When made like the instructions say...4 teaspoons per cup of water, the drink is little more than colored water with a whiff of peppermint. I did a bit of experimenting and added twice that much into a cup of water. Still not enough flavor for me but it was hot and got me a little warmer.<br /><br />Another thing that is interesting about this drink mix is that it does have coffee in it. About 16 down on the ingredients list so I'm thinking they just passed a bean over this container. I went a bit further and added some already made coffee and a little more powder to my concoction and it was quite good.<br /><br />This drink smacks of chocolate drink mix.  Looks almost exactly like nestle quik only a little finer.  Being 7.1 ounces, it doesn't take long for this powder to be gone.<br /><br />The nutrition facts are a little strange in that the serving size is 1 1/3 tablespoons per 8 ounce cup which is what they consider a serving. With that, there are 17 serving in this little box and 50 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 40 mg. of sodium , 7 sugars and 9 carbs. The first three ingredients are some sort of sugars.<br /><br />Would I get this again?  No! It is good but only the way I make it.",0
"Was getting VitaCoco, decided to try this brand. First impression was that it tasted weird, maybe a little spoiled. Subsequent tastings elicit an ""OK"" but not much more. I still prefer VitaCoco at this point.<br /><br />I have a couple more of these, so I'll update this review if I change my mind.",0
"We have a 4-year old Jack Russell mix who has tried Purina Beneful.  When feeding him the food, he seems to like it okay and does not appear to reject it.  The food doesn't appear to be as smelly as some other foods are.  Since we have never purchased the product, I am not sure as to how competitively priced Beneful may be compared to other products.<br /><br />So far, Beneful seems to be okay.  I am not an expert on dog food, but some reviewers have expressed reservations about some of the supposedly less healthy ingredients. Based on that and if the price appears to be higher than similar products, we may not regularly purchase the product.",0
"I decided to give this a try because of the benefits stated in the product description.  I used 2 of these everyday so went through the entire box fairly quickly.  I found that I needed to add green tea to it to get a little more flavor, on its own it is quite bland.  I don't know if I reaped any benefits from drinking this tea, but I do like that it is caffeine free.",0
"These fries are okay...just not real exciting.<br />The flavors are a little off and kind of weak.<br />I don't do spice...but my boyfriend said the jalepeno were pretty good.<br />These are really light and airy, not super satisfying.<br />The best part is that you get the whole bag for only 110 calories.<br />It really feels like you're getting a lot (number wise)--and that's my favorite part of them.<br />Will eat them all but won't order them again.",0
"When I purchased this I thought it was baking coco, my fault.  It's really great hot cocoa though.  Next time I will read the info better, lol.",0
"While I like the taste of the blend I received this time, I would be happier if Senseo offered a generic bean, such as Columbian Supremo instead of an unidentifiable blend. By offering a blend, Senseo can change the mix to reflect their current costs for the various Columbian beans. The next time I purchase this, if I do, it could have an entirely differant taste.",0
"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea.",0
These are alright.  Def. have to rinse them the odor is not pleasant.  The texture is strange a little chewy. They are filling and need to be spiced up with something.  Not sure if I will buy again.,0
I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang),0
I ordered these because it said it was .11 per ounce. You get 12- 8.2 packages for 21.13. That's 98.4 oz for 21.13 which is actually .21 per ounce.,0
"Just got this honey today and tasted it.  It has a slightly medicinal taste I don't care for.  On doing a little research, I found that the bees feed on flowers of the tree that's also called teatree, and if you have ever smelled teetree oil that's what the honey tastes like..almost a menthol taste. But since it is supposed to have such benefits health-wise, and since it was so expensive, I guess I'll go ahead and try using it..maybe to sweeten drinks or something..but for breakfast toast I'll stick to our good local honey.",0
"My husband suffers from heart burn and takes antacids daily, so I had him give Puroast a try. His thoughts are:<br /><br />- the Puroast is tolerable if there is no other alternative, but it does not compare well in his mind to regular coffee. The taste was somewhat bitter<br /><br />- given the price - almost $18 for 10 packs - it's almost better just not to drink coffee at all<br /><br />- if you must absolutely have some sort of coffee and cannot at all have regular coffee, this might be an acceptable alternative.",0
"I really like the ""on the go"" mixes that are single or double servings in a tube. I drink the Ocean Spray and Crystal Light ones all the time. I like iced tea so I figured that I might like this too. That wasn't the case. I found this didn't mix in as well and while it smelled awesome, the favor just wasn't there for me. It smelled like strawberries but didn't really taste like them. There was maybe a hint of strawberries when you first take a drink but the after taste from the green tea didn't really work for me. I think I'd skip these next time.",0
"It's hard for me to write a review for dog food because I'm never really sure what to say other than whether or not my dog liked it. She seems to like it okay, though I don't think she loves it. She'll eat it when she's hungry but otherwise ignores it. I'm not sure, though, that it is the healthiest dog food out there, though I'm not as ""up"" on what ingredients are best for dogs, and what should be avoided. It does seem like there are a lot of filler/cheap ingredients instead of the truly nutritious ingredients one would want. I did love how it was packaged, with a easy to use plastic zipper across the top of the bag. That has been really handy... but not a reason to buy dog food, of course.",0
"This is a tasty product, but not quite sweet enough for me as it comes. A spoonful of sugar makes it right, but the prices for this stuff are ridiculous.<br />The tea supply was not (to my knowledge) affected by the recent coffee shortage which raised prices across the board. This price comes out to almost 60 cents a cup and I pay less than that for Kona blend k-cups, even with the shortage. I will not be buying this product just because of that. Profit is ok, obscene profit is not. Shame on you Green Mountain!",0
"Not quite what I expected. Is not nearly as robust or flavorful as the dark roast. I was not expecting such a large gap between dark and medium roast. I will stick to the dark roast blends from now on as the medium is just an okay cup of coffee, not much flavor.",0
"My Wheaten puppy likes these treats and I like that they're made from good ingredients. But I gave this product three stars, because there was a problem with its packaging. The interlocking seal doesn't line up, so the bag is impossible to close. I guess I'll just repackage the treats myself. It's not a huge problem, but I'm just a little disappointed.",0
"My cat is in the early stages of renal failure and I bought this as part of my efforts to find an appropriate food he would eat.  Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored.  Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked.  I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.<br /><br />There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews.  There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.<br /><br />So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!<br /><br />Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.<br /><br />More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well.",0
"I don't know that there is anything about Essentia's taste that will wow you.  It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn't have that ""clean"" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a ""silky"" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That's baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I'll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three ""individual size"" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.  If you are buying water purely for superior taste, this isn't anything special.<br /><br />Overall, it is what it is advertised to be.  I am a little put off by the baking soda content, but other than that, it's OK.",0
"The world changed for the me the first time I tried a bottle of Starbucks Mocha Frappucino about 10 years ago. The product tasted better than the one you get in store, and the convenience of being able to grab a bottle of a Frappucino and take it to the office was great. Illy's Issimo Caff&egrave; ""Coffee Drink"" comes in a sharp-looking six-ounce can, so there's no disputing the convenience of the product. However, the taste was another matter - flat, bland, and underwhelming. In fact, if I had to rate the flavor of all the packaged coffee drinks I've tried over the years, this would be close to the bottom of the list. Perhaps their other drinks pack more of a flavor punch, but Issimo Caff&egrave; Coffee Drink was a disappointment.",0
These chips are not as good as the other Terra products I have tried.  They are too spicy to taste anything but spice and they also have a shape and texture that are not very good.,0
"I can remember when SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE first came out.  It was cold, in those far-off cave-days, and we had to be wary of the occasional roaming saber-tooth tiger.....<br /><br />OK, OK -- so I'm NOT THAT old, and neither, (despite being around for 50 years or so), is SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE.  In actual fact, though I saw (what was probably the first) ADS for Sanka Coffee, I never got to drink it, because 1)I wasn't old enough to drink coffee then, and 2) In our house, we used up one jar of instant coffee before buying another, and then, only usually when it was on sale, and we had a coupon for it.<br /><br />From what I remember, SANKA was one of the first, (if not THE first), decaffeinated coffee around.  But now -- so many years later -- I notice that there are TWO VARIETIES of SANKA instant coffee to be had:  DECAFFEINATED, and NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED.  I don't<br />THINK there were two types of INSTANT SANKA around then....but, when finally buying some for myself, I decided to opt for the NATURALLY decaffeinated instant -- both because I strongly suspect that this was the original, and because I, along with so many others, believe that ""naturally"" is the best way to prepare anything....<br /><br />The jar, of course, has changed.  It always featured an orangy-coloured label --but to begin with, it had<br />a picture of what looked like a middle-eastern carafe on it.  This, I suppose, put the image of good and rich Turkish coffee in the would-be buyers' minds -- though I'm not sure it ever contained any Turkish coffee....<br /><br />Well, the jar still has an orangy-label. The middle-eastern caraf, however, has long been gone from this label.  This doesn't bother me that much.  But -- IT NOW COMES IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED JAR FROM THAT PICTURED HERE ON AMAZON, EVEN AS I WRITE MY REVIEW! Not only this.....but the jars of this coffee that I received are made of ---- P_L_A_S_T_I_C____!!!!!!<br /><br />Everyone today -- or most people, anyway, have, I think, some ideas in their mind of the things they think MIGHT herald the end of civilzation as we know it, for, after all, this IS 2011.  And next year....!....well, who knows?<br /><br />Someone wrote that the end of civilization just MIGHT be indicated by the multi-nominated Susan Lucci actually winning a Daytime Emmy Award.  (This happened --but NO-ONE, to my knowledge, ever predicted the CANCELLTION of the wonderful soap-opera, ""All My Children"", on which Ms. Lucci appears. (!)  For myself, I've always had this idea that as long as the instant coffees produced by Maxwell House came in GLASS jars, we were somehow safe.  But now, I find that SANKA INSTANT, NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED, in the 8 oz jars, (pack of 4), are presently actually being packed in ...(gasp!)....PLASTIC!  And not only plastic -- but in No. 1 plastic!  (Only No. 5 and No. 6 platics are reputedly safe -- to reuse that is.  Still....I feel queasy about this.  And now to my mind comes the even more horrible thought that perhaps ALL Maxswell House Instant Coffees will soon be packed in PLASTIC jars!  PLASTIC NEVER KEEPS IN FLAVOUR A WELL AS GLASS DOES!<br /><br />....................As far as the flavour of THIS coffee goes, (and I'm sorry I took so long in getting to this main point) -- it's good....but not great.  A mild flavour with just a hint of underlying deep richness is how I'd describe it.  I made it the way instant coffee should be made -- with water that has been boiled as MUCH as possible, (when making tea, let the water boil as LITTLE as possible.)  So -- this coffee is good -- but nothing really spectacular.  As always, like other instant, (and regular), coffees, it's also best kept in the refrigerator after opening, to preserve whatever flavour is there....especially now, when it is in a (gulp!) PLASTIC jar!<br /><br />The new jar is easy to hold, with a cylindrical base, then half-way up, it slopes slightly inward.  Around the upper portion are indentations, which look like drops of water, and, I suppose, are supposed to represent perked-coffee flavour.<br /><br />To me, however, they somehow look like tears...  :_(",0
"I made the unfortunate assumption that organic corn puffs would be wheat-free.  The online product info doesn't say either way, but the package, once you receive it, does warn that they're made in a facility that also processes wheat.  As someone who does fine with corn but is allergic to wheat, I had a violent reaction to them.  They taste good, but they're definitely not for anyone who needs to avoid wheat; that should be prominently stated in their description.",0
I checked this item at vita cost. The package states certified organic by QA. It is not usda certified organic as shown in the ad. Please correct the error in your advertisement.,0
"I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.  Beaba now makes a larger machine also.  I guess the cost is a little less for the Brezza but because of the disadvantage I am about to mention it absolutely does not work for me!  I chose the Beaba because you cannot put your jar or small glass container right into the Brezza to defrost or reheat like you can with the Beaba because of that middle rod that is part of the blades.  It is completely in the way in my opinion and they force you to use their plastic containers to store and reheat food!  I freeze my baby food in these tiny glass lock containers because I try to use glass when I can for storage.  I also buy the glass organic pre made baby food when I don't have time to cook as a backup and I need to be able to warm those since the baby doesn't eat the whole jar yet so I store left overs in the refrigerator.  You can put the jars and the glass containers directly in the Beaba basket to defrost and heat and I could not use the Brezza to do it.  I would have to defrost at room temp or in fridge then transfer to heat which takes way too long and I would have to transfer to the brezza containers which are plastic and then heat.  Not only this is completely time consuming (I do not use the microwave it irradiates your food, destroys nutrients and it is horrible!) it is also plastic and even though BPA free I am trying to avoid plastic like I mentioned so just steaming and blending in plastic is already too much for me so for storage I use glass only.  So this is a good machine but if you are looking for defrost/reheat function where you can put your own containers and jars into this machine will not work.",0
"Thought these would look cool on our son's birthday cake.  I am an experienced decorator but I just wasn't impressed by the strips.  In the end, I really don't care for any edible images.",0
"Yes, my dog loves this.  Is it good for him?  Probably not.  A little research confirmed my suspicions.  I guess it's a little better than the cheapest dog foods out there, but the ingredients are still low-end and rather disgusting.  Still, if you want nutritious and healthy dog food, you are going to have to pay for it, about two to three times what this costs.",0
"It was very dry, and a lot of Grissel, Looks like they left the string on the roast when they served it.",0
"I'm not sure how they (Mareblu Naturals) managed to list cashews as the first ingredient on this almond crunch...perhaps that's how it ended up being sold by Amazon.  At any rate, it IS actually almonds, not cashews in the package.  However, having consumed a LOT of Mareblu Naturals Almond Crunch in the last couple of years, I will say that they have changed it for the worse.  The pieces of almond are much smaller than they were, meaning there is more of the ""candy"" part (the sugar/rice malt which hold the almonds together, much like peanut brittle) than there used to be.  Previously it was large pieces and even some whole almonds.  Now it is more like chopped almonds and even crumbs.  Obviously, I preferred the former.  It is still OK but not nearly as great as it was.  I considered ordering the Mrs. Mays version instead, but noticed that it says something about ingredients coming from China for that brand, so I will stick with Mareblu if I am going to have almond crunch at all, I just wish they would change it back to the original version, and perhaps they could correct the ingredient list on the package...",0
"The taste was okay. I ordered these as a snack for my triplet two-year-olds. They eat pretty much anything but wouldn't touch these. Oh-well, I tried.",0
"I have found the quality control of my recent purchases of K-Cups to be marginal, at best.  I look for cups whose foil covers bulge at the top.  Unfortunately, many of the cups seem to have their seals breached, and the cover is flat and sometimes concave.  The performance of these cups is often terrible, with grounds escaping both within the coffee maker and into the cup of coffee and coffee even spilling out of the maker beyond the bounds of the rim of the cup.  Worse yet, the taste of the coffee is lifeless and insipid.  In a word, it is stale.  When the packaging seems intact the coffee tastes fine, and there is no mess or clean up necessary.  I'll keep searching for a more reliable provider.",0
I drink Coconut water every day. When I saw a deal on a case I bought it. Well I have to say that the one I have been getting at the store are much better than the case I was sent. It tastes as though there is 1/4 cup of sugar in these ones. The expiration date is 3 months out so it should be fine but it is not. I will be calling for a refund. Bummer I thought I found an easy way to have my coco water delivered.,0
"First off, let me say that when you see the bottle and realize that per serving is 1/2 ounce, you think this will last a long time.  However, for any real flavor (at least in my opinion) it took 2 significant squeezes to handle a standard water bottle.  With Mio I was able to get by with 2 squeezes, but the amount used was less.  When you squeeze on this bottle, it seems like a lot comes out.<br /><br />As far as the energy goes, I wasn't buzzed and flying around, but it did seem to help me through the afternoons where I tend to drag the most.<br /><br />The taste left something to be desired.  Even after 2 full squeezes, the flavor seemed very faint to me and not very fruity at all.<br /><br />All in all, just an average product, I like Mio more, but really wonder if this stuff is necessary in any fashion and that it may be better to just stick with my vitamins.",0
"The flavor is more of a minty / menthol cinnamon. Personally, I prefer straight cinnamon, though it's okay when you get used to it.<br /><br />Like the texture (not the kind that gets hard with chewing).<br /><br />Don't love that it doesn't last too long, but then again, I have the same complaint about pretty much every gum I've ever had.",0
"I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product.  So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!!  This oil has a BITTER finish.  Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable!  Has the production changed?  Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation?  First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself.",0
"Purchased these on sale around superbowl time when we go through lots of dips.  Normally buy locally, but the town was sold out and we try to be as organic as possible.  Family has mixed reviews about taste & texture.",0
"These appear to be pretty healthy online but after the taste test I am probably going to stop the auto-ship function as they are too sweet, especially for a ""healthy"" snack. Sugar and Glucose in the cranberry bars and honey and Glucose in the almond & coconut. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and somewhat healthy but just a little too sweet for me. knock some of the sugar out and it would be an excellent health snack.",0

"This tea arrived on time and is the second time I have bought it.  It is ok but not exactly what I had hoped for, a sweeter tea.  When I use it with sugar crystals, the tea is better.",0
"I've bought this at my local grocer for some time and love it so I was happy to see it here. However, what I got here was stale and required 2 bags instead of 1 for the same cup of hot water. The teabags seem really stale. I would not recommend buying this tea here, especially since it ends up costing alot more (if you have to use twice as much tea). Plus you can't return it.",0
"Not as good as the reviews led me to expect. Despite great color and good viscosity, the syrup's flavor lacked intensity.  I'll continue my quest elsewhere.",0
"I bought the 5-pack a while ago and have been cooking each pack on and off for about a year and a half.  I just finished making the last packet and finally tweaked it to my liking.  I LOVE butter chicken at Indian restaurants, but I found that if you followed the instructions exactly on this packet, it doesn't taste anything like what I get in the restaurants (please no arguments about ""authenticity"").  What I did this last time was add MORE butter (around 5 tablespoons...closer to 6), add about 1/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 1 cup of water, about 3 tablespoons of honey, salt to taste (I usually hate adding additional salt when using spice mixes) and coconut milk instead of heavy cream at the end.  I have not tried any other butter chicken spice mixes, but I do like the Kitchens of India one for its nice spice kick.  Not too spicy hot, but enough for you to notice and enjoy while tasting all the other flavors.  It's definitely cheaper than going out, and it's nice to know that I can get close to what I get in the restaurants whenever I get a butter chicken craving.",0
"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first.",0
"These didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.  They are organic and made with whole wheat flour, so that was the positive!  We eat them with hummus and other dips.",0
"Just received my Kona-Pod ""variety Pack"" and was surprised to find two types, Silver & Gold. When it says variety, I thought they meant variety. In my book, two is not a variety.<br />Color me disappointed. Just hope the taste is as good as advertised.",0
"This looks/smells/tastes like it could be the stuffing or filling for something else. To make this a complete meal, add some refried beans, salsa, and roll up in a tortilla for a very tasty burrito.",0
This product is not my favorite.It is pretty much tasteless and i do not eat it on its own.i do put it in my soups and stews.I have not tried it mixed into rice but it does need some additions to give it taste.,0
"Olives are GOOD for you and I was very intrigued by the packaging.  I would like to find some that NOT herbed or flavored... just nice, plain green olives... I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring.. but the olives themselves were good.  A few were extra soft, but I don't mind that.  Super convenient!",0

"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",0
"I love Muir Glen tomatoes and have used them for years.  Since I use so much of them, I thought I'd order them in a 12-pack and get a good price, but I may have to go back to buying them at my local co-op.  Most of the cans were dented.  The packaging seemed fine and undamaged, so I'm not sure it happened when they were shipped to me - perhaps Amazon got them that way, but the end result was I got dented cans.  At least at my local store I can check the cans before bringing them home.",0
"The product ain't bad, not bad at all; crispy cookie, peanut butter layer (that same highly-processed and not-really-peanut-buttery stuff one finds in Reese's and peanut-butter-esque cookies), covered in fudge. With a hint of mint, mostly in aftertaste, which you wouldn't for a second think would go with peanut butter, but it actually works. What I question is the brand association. And I admit, this is probably a personal thing and you can switch me off right now, but come on. If it's an Oreo, it's got two cookies with stuff sandwiched in the middle, not one cookie with stuff piled on top. Yes, I admit that's a petty reason to dock it a star, but come on, is it an Oreo if you can't do the Oreo Twist(TM)?<br /><br />I think these guys are good enough to break from the brand association and go it on their own. Would be a good idea, IMO.",0
"This bone is MASSIVE!!!  Probably the biggest bone that I have ever seen.  My 135 lb. bullmastiff puppy loved this!  When I opened the packaging, 1/4 of the bone was broken and fell off, which was fine because I didn't want to overwhelm my puppy.  I was able to store the larger part in the fridge for another time.  He gnawed on it all day and night, but later in the evening, threw up a big pile on the carpet.  I think all of the fatty bits made him get an upset stomach, so I put the bone away until the following day.  He is a serious chewer and pretty much got that small portion down to a piece that could fit in the palm of your hand, with bits of bone laying everywhere.  Obviously, he ate most of the pieces and 2 days later was throwing up.  Needless to say, even though this bone is awesome and your dog will most likely love it, you probably need to limit their access to very short periods of time and definitely supervise.  It also smells horrible and the smell will get all over your dog and anything it touches.  I will not be bringing the other larger piece out for a long while.",0
I tried to like these but the consistency is too much like cornbread.  I understand this is not a chemical loaded DH mix but it could use a better cake unbleached flour to make the texture a bit more airy and moist.,0
"Currently, the rabbit for this (and the RAW frozen) are sourced from China. Only the Instinct Dry kibble uses rabbit sourced from France. It's an oddity amongst NV's products (everything else seems to be sourced from the US.) Buyer beware as, despite reassurances, Chinese sourced food has had lots of problems (chemical contamination.) Supposedly, at the moment, NV is looking to change the source for the wet canned and frozen to France as well; but it hasn't happened yet.",0
"Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only ""taste tested"" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like).",0
"There's no doubt that water will taste quite different from source to source, but for the most part, unless you live in a town with a high sulfur or arsenic concentration, you don't NEED bottled water. A good PUR, Brita or Zero Water filter should be enough. So no one actually needs to PURCHASE Essentia. That said, if you're on a long car ride or visiting another country, bottled water makes sense. Essentia is a high pH water (on the base side. Low would be acidic and you wouldn't want to drink it). It tastes...okay. I've have better and I've had worse. It's a little pricer than most bottled water, but I'm happy that it is Electrolyte infused and that the bottles are BPA and Phthalate free. That makes Essentia a better choice than Aquavita or even Fiji which has a massively high carbon footprint.<br /><br />All in all, it's water. I can't say I'd go out of my way for this as I'd prefer to get Smartwater for my electrolyte enchanced h20 (better tasting), but I'd pick this up over a lot of the more common mass produced, secretly just tap water brands.",0
"I am a dog trainer and this was a cool vine item to review. I always need new cool dog stuff. The dogs liked the toy /reward once they got a few licks.

Formed plastic one time use. so 1990s sigh. sigh . sigh . very bad for the planet. please do not buy a plastic waste like this. I would pay extra for refillable container. anyone have one?",0
I was very happy to find this item at Amazon. The pet shops around here (north of Boston) don't seem<br />to be able get them lately. This is my dog's favorite chew treat.

"I compared this to Purina Dog Chow which is my dogs' normal diet.  They sniffed and pushed the little pieces of carrots and peas around and then eventually ate it but they weren't particularly enthralled.  The next day the same thing they sniffed, snorted, pushed some pieces around and then just sat there.  After a few hours all the food was eaten.  For the price it was not particularly beneficial or dog friendly.  The next day they ate the Beneful but then kept going back to see if there was something else in their bowl, when I went back to Dog Chow they were much more agreeable and ate their dinner as they'd normally done.  I mixed in the Beneful into the Dog Chow and they'd eat the Dog Chow first and leave all the little dried pieces of carrots and peas.  By the end of the day they'd eaten them but it was obvious they weren't the favored food.",0
"I was given one of these as a gift. Usually, depending on how bamboo have been treated it can last for a few days to a couple of months. My bamboo like this lived two and a half years, so I was well pleased with it. So the bamboo was lucky - I cannot really attest as to whether or not it gave me luck. Enjoy, and prepare to transplant quickly if your bamboo really starts thriving!",0
"Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.",0

As a beginner ,I used this and several other brands but nothing beats a good homemade mix.I suggest that this product tastes OK but not awesome.",0
"For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of ""Beetlejuice"" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, ""Beetlejuice"" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0
"Ok...my husband had me purchase this sauce as he is a big pepper fanatic and could not wait to try the Naga Jolokia pepper. He was sorely disappointed in this sauce. We live in the Caribbean and are accustomed to really hot peppers, although I personally am not a pepper person.<br /><br />After the first tentative taste of this sauce my husband sighed in disappointment and proceeded to literally drench his food in it to get that ""eye burning, choking"" sensation that apparently all pepper fanatics can't wait to experience.<br /><br />I have not tried the sauce, but he says that in addition to the heat being just mild to moderate, there is not much flavour there. Anyway, heat level is a subjective and relative thing, so as far as my review goes...thumbs down on expected heat and flavour.<br /><br />I think his next step is to try the raw naga jolokia peppers. Good luck to him!<br /><br />I would just like to add to the above review and state that it is now 5 months later and I have since tried the naga jholokia sauce, as my spouse did not seem that impressed. I found it hot and spicy, but nothing that made my eyes water. The heat from the ghost peppers has been tempered with carrots, papaya and passion fruit. Still maintain the 3 star rating.",0
"I have loved Nance's mustard for 50 years, but the last case I got had a different taste and it just isn't as good as the original.  I don't know why they changed the recipe  but they need to go back.  Remember ""New Coke"", they went back and I hope Nance's will do the same !!",0

"We have a chow mix who's never occupied for long.  I read the reviews on this one and had hoped to keep her busy for an hour or two.<br /><br />She's too smart!  Within 10 min she figured out how to wedge the treat out of the ball and crunched it away.  Total elapsed time the first time we gave it to her - 15 minutes.  Each subsequent time - 5 min.<br /><br />Our other dog can spend up to 30 min on it (if the chow doesn't steal it for herself).<br /><br />We gave some as christmas gifts, and the other dogs took a bit longer (and a chihuahua now loves playing fetch with the empty plastic holder).<br /><br />It's a good product, just realize that the time it will occupy your dog is based on how determined they are to ""kill"" it and get the treat.",0

We purchased a large table top popcorn machine with an 8oz. kettle. It is a little difficult to squeeze the oil portion into the large kettle.  The flavor of the popcorn is quite good.  The packages are easy to store.  Overall my rating was 3 stars because of the difficulty with the solidified oil. We have a family of 5 and use 2 packages to satisfy all of us.  One package can easily feed 3-4 people.,0

The Tur-Duc-Hen I ordered was advertized having corn bread stuffing and sausage. The one I received was stuffed with only rice. The bird itself was good and delivery was fast. If it was not for the mix up between rice and corn bread stuffing I would have given this Item a 4 out of 5.,0

"I normally buy the generic version of powdered Splenda from Walmart.  Haven't done the math but, I'd bet the farm that I can sweeten DOUBLE the volume of tea or coffee with the Walmart generic sweetener.  This stuff lasted no time!",0
"My 60-lb lab mix loved this bone (the large size)! I like that it doesn't leave a nasty mess all over the floor and didn't give Hobbes any gas or stool problems. But I bought it thinking that it would last awhile, since its large and feels hard, but he finished it in 5 minutes flat. Not very cost effective, since they are pretty expensive and don't last long, but I will reiterate that my dog absolutely loved it.",0
"The description is incomplete - this item is whole bean, not ground.  They also do not let you return the item, so I am out $65 for something I can't use.  Buyer beware.",0
"I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.",0
"I concur with other reviewers regarding the skunky smell this coffee can have while brewing.  It's sort of skunky, but I also described it as burnt chocolate.  It's not overwhelming but if your standing over your Keurig while its brewing, the smell can make you take a step back.  Once it's done brewing though, the actual coffee smells just fine.  You won't walk in to work with your mug and have people think you brought in a pet skunk.<br /><br />The taste really isn't bad at all to be quite honest.  It's not a strong cup of coffee, it even says ""Mild"" on the box, so don't expect that.<br /><br />I think when some people say that it doesn't taste like plain coffee with Kahlua in it probably haven't actually put plain Kahlua in coffee.  They've probably put one of the flavored Kahlua products in their coffee, like hazelnut or french vanilla (which is very yummy).  Plain Kahlua is just a coffee liqueur, that kinda tastes like, well, coffee.<br /><br />I only gave three stars because of the slight inconvenience of the brewing smell and because it's just too mild for me.  My wife seems to like it more than I do, but she's not really a coffee drinker, so the mildness must appeal more to her.",0
"The first box I got of these were great with very fresh tasting nuts; however, the second box was not so fresh and some of the bars had a stale taste.  Nothing worse than a stale nut--can't get that taste out of your mouth.  I guess I'll give it one more try before I cancel my Subscribe & Save for this product.",0
"These bars have a fairly good taste to them, and have a texture that makes them almost like a chewy nut-based candy bar; they are very sticky.  If you're sensitive to salty peanuts, I don't recommend these since that is the dominant taste. In fact, I couldn't taste the raisins in them at all.<br /><br />These come in at 200 calories,  12 grams of fat (18% of your daily value), 230 mg of sodium (10%), 18 grams of carbs (6%), 5 grams of fiber (20%), 9 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />While I do like these, I'm giving them 3 1/2 stars for a few reasons. First of all, this is an awfully tiny bar for 200 calories.  I know that nut bars (Larabars come to mind, too) tend to have more calories than non-nut-based bars, but these are very tiny.  Additionally, while they are billed as using organic peanuts, in the list of ingredients, about half of the ten main ingredients are not organic, including the peanut flour and peanut butter that are added in addition to the actual peanuts.  It seems misleading to use organic peanuts, but not organic PB.<br /><br />For a vegan bar, these are tasty, but I don't see myself purchasing a box after I run out of my first box.",0
I ordered th brittle from Judy's and it came from Low Carb. It was too hard and not enough peanuts for me.,0
The Zwieback toast had a good taste.  I compare it to the Old Nabisco zwieback and it doesn't quite measure up.  I also did not like the size of the product.  It was small in comparison to other zwieback products.  It was o.k. but I would not order again.,0
"These cookies are great right out of the oven but left to sit for more than a day or 2 they tend to get this sandy, crumbly texture.  The Betty Crocker brownies taste great and keep much better.  Might I also suggest that if you don't know how some of the gluten free products taste to begin with and to save money and probably waste, see if you can find it at your local store.  If you like it enough then buy it in the bulk that Amazon sells.  I have read a few reviews of customers who have purchased in bulk, don't like the item(s) and have been left with a product they don't want to use at all.  Buy one package (if possible and if it is available in your area) and then decide to buy more.  I hope that helps!  And donate the rest of the unwanted product to the food pantry etc.  Thanks!",0
"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs.  The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!!  But, there was way too much unpopped corn.  We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought.  The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!",0
"This is a fairly decent, commercial berbere mixture.  It has a fair bit of heat, owing to a large amount of cayenne/red pepper flakes (some of which seemed to have missed the grinder).  The balance in flavors isn't what you would expect from a fresher product or if you ground/toasted your own spices but it gets the job done particularly if you like your wats spicy.  However, for the price this isn't a good value.  The American Spices Berbere sold here has a deeper, balanced flavor profile and is vastly cheaper than this product.",0
"I ordered this and it tasted fine, like normal pasta. It did give my family gas, but it did not raise my blood sugar. I ordered 2 boxes to try it and both boxes were shattered. I had 1 unbroken piece in 2 boxes which was disappointing. I paid over $[...] in shipping for 2 boxes and they took over a week to arrive and then came in bits. For that price I expect whole product.If my local grocery carried this, I would buy it regularly, but with the price of the product and the shipping so expensive, I most likely won't order this again.",0
Good coffee but not what I expected.  Lacked the flavor burst that was missing.,0
"I have purchased marzipan from this company several times before and was always extremely satisfied.  The main complaint that I had up to my last purchase was that they did not always have it in stock, and the wait was sometimes quite long. The price is very high also, but for excellent marzipan, it would be worth the price.  Unfortunately, this was not excellent marzipan.  Although, the previous marzipan I received from them was very good, the last box that I purchased was not at all tasty.  In fact, it had almost no almond taste, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan.  Let's hope they go back to their old recipe!",0
"Although well made,  this is a rather bland jam.  Neither the apricots nor the almonds stand out in flavor.",0
"This tea is much more bitter than other Stash black teas. I brew using the ""moon brew"" method, leaving the bag in the pitcher in the fridge overnight. I use a 4 quart pitcher so it is not an issue of too little water. I recommend brewing for less than 5 hours to ensure less bitterness.",0
"The packaging looked nice but excessive and the actual contents were somewhat disappointing.  The actual amount of tea in the individual small plastic baggies in the small bamboo box in the shredded paper padding within the larger bamboo box within the paper wrapping within the cardboard box within the plastic air packets within the shipping box was miniscule.  The bamboo box that it came in that houses the teapot and box of tea is cute but not the sturdiest thing ever.  I hope I never drop it.  It's also a lot bigger than I realized it would be.  As for the teapot, it's cute but a good glass teapot doesn't have the sort of imperfections you can see in this (unless I'm just unlucky in getting the one with the bubbles).<br /><br />Lowest price I've seen this here: about $18",0
"Great price but I'm not so sure about the freshness.  Some of them tasted a little ""old"".  Nevertheless, a good price and the best price I found on Amazon.",0
"My standard for a good tasting cereal is whether I'd want to eat it straight from the box.  Kashi's Honey Sunshine did not pass that test for me. It tasted too ""healthy.""  You know the commercials where the person in the grocery store doesn't believe the product has any fiber?  Would not happen with this cereal.  I thought it tasted mealy.<br /><br />I knew it wasn't going to be as sweet as Cap'n Crunch (and that's a good thing) but I hoped it would be closer to Honey Nut Cheerios (which has 2 grams fiber and 10 grams sugar compared to the 6 of each in this one).  For me it tasted like Corn Pops with significantly less sugar and more fiber (Corn Pops has 0.2 gr fiber and a whopping 14.8 grams of sugar). Eating Honey Sunshine dry, I thought it had the taste and mouth feel of additional fiber.  As I said above, mealy.<br /><br />For a healthy cereal, it doesn't taste bad but it isn't going to fool a child used to more highly sweetened cereals.  But not many children need high fiber cereals so that might not be a consideration.  I won't buy this particular cereal again; I even bought a different cereal because I didn't want to finish the rest of my Honey Sunshine.",0
Buyers regret:  nice healthier sugar but way to expensive for 4 lbs not even certified as organic.  You can get 25 lbs for roughly twice the price of these 4 at Florida Crystals.,0
"Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include ""essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture"" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the ""Essential Oil Fragrance"" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.",0
"I frequently buy Post Shredded Wheat, and decided to try this new cereal because it's made of whole grain wheat.  My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but it's way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect!",0
"I don't know what to make of this. I bought these a few months back and they were great. I would have given them five stars except that I went to reorder them this morning and they've gone up over $10.for the pack???? That's over a 50% hike in just two months...........needless to say, I'll find them somewhere else.",0
"Generally the dog biscuits are great if not such a high percentage would be broken. The point in buying extra large biscuits is the ""extra large"", small pieces miss the reason for buying theme in the first place. There has to be a better way to pack the biscuits better than this.",0
"A little on the acrid side of bitter, but what else could you expect when you order a coffee named ""Jet Fuel""?<br />Definitely one of the best bang for your buck coffees available for the Keurig machines here on Amazon.com. I also loved the no hassle packaging, no extra stuff that will take up room in my recycling bin.<br />I'd buy it again, but I will have to resupply my vanilla creamer stash waaaay more often. I usually like my coffee black but this one is a bit much! If you love super bold coffee, go for it! If you are a breakfast blend with cream and sugar kinda person, maybe opt for the Donut Shop K-Cups instead.",0
"Okay, read the reviews, I LOVE chocolate mint coffee & thought it's Ghirardelli, should be good.  I was more concerned about not having enough mint taste.  For me, there really isn't enough of either chocolate or peppermint.  I make a fairly strong pot of coffee & used my normal amount of scoops.  Coffee seems weak, not much chocolate - has a bit of a bitter taste & mint is moderate.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to my old favorite, now I just wonder just how long it is going to take me to drink three bags of this stuff.",0
This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.,0
Check around your local chain stores.<br />Prices are about 1/2 of what they are on here and you dont have to wait to get them.,0
"These cookies have a great, lemony taste.  The only bad thing was that they're thin and many of them were broken.",0
This is a nice tea with subtle flavors.  It's not very tanic like some teas can be but the flavors I expect in Earl Grey are just too mild for my tastes.  I allowed it to brew longer in my second cup but it was still pretty weak.  I enjoyed it but would prefer something a little stronger.,0
"I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!",0
"I want to like this product. I really, really do. It's definitely better for cats (one of mine has asthma, and clay litters bother him a lot), and the fresh pine smell is so much better than perfumed litters or kitty waste. However, this stuff tracks everywhere! I stopped using it three weeks ago, and I'm still finding little bits of pine all over the house and in my laundry. One cat is a chronic litter digger, and the other is a Maine coon with furry toes that catch everything, so even with a covered litter box and a bath mat in front, little tiny bits of the broken pellets get everywhere. Maybe if your cats are neater than mine, this is a good choice.",0
"The Chef Michael's dog food by Nestle Purina is an OK dog food, but there's soo much better available for similar bucks with wholesome ingredients such as bison, salmon, blueberries and tomatoes. Examples include <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5U5H6"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 15-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />My German Shepherd Dogs took to Chef Michael's much better than to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> but not nearly as well as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5SLB8"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag</a> which they absolutely love and thrive very well.<br /><br />To my stunned disbelief the bag of Chef Michael's recommends feeding 1 cup per 10 pounds of dog's body weight. 9.5 cups of dog food, per day.. wow... imagine the ""landmine waste"" they would be producing! I have 95 pound dogs... they only eat at most 3 - 4 cups of Taste of the Wild.. usually much less. The reason being is rather evident in the list of ingredients:  beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled salmon steak FLAVOR, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E Supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (red 40, blue 2, yellow 5, yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, l-lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium panthothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyrodoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menodione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.

i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards,0
"These are so delicious. They have a light carmel flavor that really makes them stand out from the original flavor. These are a great healthy snack. The normal price is really not a good deal, but I purchased them when they were on special for around $20. That price, you can't beat.<br /><br />I give this three stars, just based on the price. It is 5 stars for flavor, but like 2 stars for how expensive they are (at least right now). Wait for them to go on sale!",0
I purchased thhis on the Gold Box Deal for only $7.50 so it was a great price. I was a little disappointed with the streanth. I like strong dark coffee and this was not. But it was good.,0
"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!",0
I have tried a few different flavors of the Kind bars.  I thought that the Nut Delight was just okay.  I think it's because I'm not extremely fond of brazil nuts.,0
"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.",0
I think that Rice krispy treats is better than Rice Krispies cereal. Eventhough Rice Krispy treats has a high level of sugar it's still better than the cereal.,0
Alright success until the receptionist at the vet said to use Hot dogs. Hmmm.  What dog does not like Hot Dogs?,0
"Product was shipped a little slow, also ordered the coffee maker @ the same time--which arrived 5 days  before the coffee did.<br />Product did not taste as good as our previous brand (Maxwell house/Hazelnut) or I would nave given a higher rating.<br />I will try another flavor, since this is a good value @ 21.00 for 50 K-cups.",0
"I like the DisposaKups.  If I'm fixing more than one cup, it's quicker to use the DisposaKups than it is to clean out the refillable holder, which came with my machine.",0
Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.,0
"Back when my son was first diagnosed with Celiac disease, he was supposed spend 6 months abstaining from all milk products while his gut healed.  I like making my meals from scratch when I can - although I do have plenty of evenings where I need something that is quick and easy.  I was so happy when I found this product.<br /><br />The food itself is very easy to prepare and the serving sizes are adequate.  The consistency of the noodles is great.  They're not too mushy, chalky, grainy, etc.  The cheese alternative however is really odd tasting.  I know that there's really no such thing as a decent cheese alternative, so I wasn't expecting this to taste anything like cheese.  It tastes okay at first, but the aftertaste is REALLY bitter.  It doesn't taste like anything I've ever tried before.  (I don't mean that in a good way.)<br /><br />That being said, my son kind of liked it.  It wasn't a replacement for regular macaroni and cheese - but he always ate it without complaint.  Strangely enough, my daughter absolutely loved it and she's the pickiest eater I know.  I pretended to enjoy it so my kids wouldn't decide to stop eating it - but my husband couldn't stomach it.<br /><br />All in all - I don't think that this is going to help if you're craving Kraft mac & cheese.  (That's true of nearly all dairy free cheese alternatives though.)  However, if you happen to like the flavor of this - it's a wonderfully fast gf/cf meal that can be eaten alone or dressed up.",0
"Great shipping, timely.  However, beware of the label (not listed on the Amazon.com ad) that these are very small pill pockets (barely big enough for one little tablet).  They are not the product we thought we were getting ""for capsules"".  It's hard to see that with the information they give you on the web.",0
I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.,0
It's great to have agave in a portable format.  But is is difficult to open.  The directions say to pinch to open.  They are not so easy to pinch.  I have found if you bend the tube about 1 inch above the end then pinch the end it helps.  But the agave often gets on your fingers.,0
I'm old enought to appreciate the flavor of old fashioned coffee.  Don't care for all the different flavors even though I like vanilla flavoring,0

"I usually buy real brownies, but these intrigued me so I wanted to try them. I could tell they would be too sweet for me after licking the batter spoon and I was put off by all the cocoa dust that flew out when I dumped the package. They were easy to make though and cooked just fine in cupcake liners. They made about 12 cupcakes. I ate maybe 3 with LOTS of milk and then dumped the rest in the trash. It's not that they taste horrible, it's that they taste absolutely nothing like real brownies. They taste like dark chocolate and sugar goo, in my opinion. I can't stomach diet drinks or anything made with beet sugar or fake sugar either, so I'm not surprised that I hated them.<br />I just realized that, to me, they taste very much like Snackwell's devil food cookies. I never liked those, but I know plenty of people that did.",0
"I have Not tried this coconut water yet, but I plan to try it. Therefore many of you will think I should not be posting here. I'm putting 3 * bec. apparently I can't post this unless I rate it, but that's not an actual rating.  However, in light of all the comments regarding Jon's post, I thought I'd share some things I read on the Internet re coconut water & coconuts. I suspect there might be some people who are interested. Pasteurization kills a lot of the beneficial ingredients in coconut water, but it's an FDA requirement that All coconut water be pasteurized (possibly the brand that's sold in a crystalized form doesn't need to be pasteurized (I don't know).  I read on several sites that coconuts shipped to this country are preserved in formaldehyde, so maybe it's actually better to drink the coconut water that's packaged from coconuts in their native country, than to drink it from the coconut itself which has been shipped here. Of course drinking it from the coconut itself when you're lucky enough to be in a tropical country would be best. I read that many of the plantations add sugar to the soil to make the coconut water sweet.  No idea if that's actually bad.",0
"the packs are definitely not that easy to use, big and bulky, they could have cut it down A LOT and been just fine.<br /><br />the popcorn is GOOD, good quality. most of the kernels pop and are very tasty.  the oil is ok, not quite theater quality, but not bad, the salt, however, is a different story all together.  i does not taste good, NOT good at all.  if you use the whole portion it is FAR too salty, and definitely does not taste like theater popcorn, in fact the first batch i made i was so disappointed i thought i should have just kept buying microwaveable.<br /><br />however I've been playing and experimenting, as i don't ant to waste a whole $25.  i definitely like using all of the kernals and oil, and about 3/4th of the salt, it seems pretty good this way.<br /><br />i will buy a different brand next time, or just buy a whole box of salt directly from the theater and substitute that salt for this, however it is convenient and not too bad after you figure out the perfect recipe for you and your family.",0
"Despite the Lipton brand, Lipton's Green Tea tastes more like a product that a seasoned green tea drinker might enjoy, rather than a casual drinker of mass produced tea. The flavor of this green tea might turn-off a lot of casual tea drinkers who expect green tea to taste like something you might find in most bottled ice tea (and no it does not taste like Lipton's bottled Green Tea). As a hot tea green tea Lipton Green Tea has a smoky and bitter taste that might not appeal to a mass consumer green tea market, however as an iced tea the taste redeems itself as it mellows out.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand of green tea to folks who like smoky and bitter green tea. When hot the tea has a smoky aspect that is very apparent. As an iced tea you have a softer smoky taste.<br /><br />The price is actually pretty good as green tea is pretty expensive. Before investing in an Amazon 6-pack you might want to buy a single box or find someone who drinks this brand of tea to sample it.",0
"I discovered Yorkshire Gold tea in the north of England in the 1990s when one still couldn't purchase it in the USA. Amazon has been a great resource. However, my last few purchases have been a bit disappointing. The tea tastes a bit ""off."" I have no idea if the quality has diminished or the tea is not fresh. I still like it well-enough, just not enough to give it a top grade.",0
"My favorite dressing is the Dole White Basalmic Vinaigrette that comes in the Cherry Almond Bleu salad mix. I found a copycat recipe I wanted to try but could never find a white basalmic vinegar in the local stores, hence my purchase on Amazon (they have everything!!!). I made the dressing and though it wasn't an exact match it was close, the main difference being my version wasn't as sweet and mild. I did add more sugar which helped but as I have made other dressings with the darker balsamic vinegar I know that the sugar I added was substantial. So my theory is this vinegar is a bit stronger and more bitter than I was led to believe and I would have to say that this product is just okay.",0
"My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating.",0
"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.",0

"If you like diet Arizona Green Tea, and want to try to mix it a home instead of lugging the gallon containers home from the store, you are like me.

These ESE pods sure are convenient but they were not very flavorful.  I like the Illy pods much better...better yet fresh ground is the way to go.,0

They were ok.  They had a strange plasticy smell about them.  Several small brown peices like they were overcooked or went bad.  A few peices with those little bugs in them.  Next time I'm just going to buy them from my local Indian grocery.,0
"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",0
"Good coffee and a nice selection, but it was more expensive than you can find at Walmart or on sale at the grocery store, etc.",0
This is a great idea..easy to make..and nutritious...but it is way too salty. I had to cut it with a bag of white rice to be paletable. I wish they would provide the spices on the side so you could add as much as you need.,0
"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.",0
"My kids don't get a lot of sweets. So we were all excited to try out this popcorn. It's a little too chewy for my taste. The sweetener was more honey-like, rather than ""sugar-y"" if that makes a difference to you. It didn't to my children. They all scarfed it down. Except the two year old. She actually spit hers out, as if I had poisoned her.<br /><br />So, it's pretty good, but I have pretty laid back kids when it comes to eating. I won't be purchasing this again, since it wasn't a ""slam dunk"" with the whole family. Not terrible, but not great.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Suzanne Gose<br />Mother of Five, Teacher, Author<br />Flip Flop Spanish Series<br />The Key to Learning Anything",0
"I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.",0
This product has a good taste but was melted and stuck to the wrapper.  It made a mess getting it out of the wrapper.<br /><br />I could no longer find it in grocery stores and maybe this is the reason.,0
"These are good if a little dry in the chocolate flavor - best with coffee in the morning.  However, they are under $4/box in a store depending on the store.  Try the product but dont pay this price!",0
I wish every brand would offer a 1 can sample for sale or even free so I can find out if my cat will eat it before<br />buying 12 cans.,0
"This peach tea was disappointing. The flavor is more spiced like a chai tea and really doesn't taste like peach at all. Bigelow's Rasberry tea is fantastic, but this is just odd.",0
"The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere.",0
"This is a gret product,due to the quality and value. I apply this oil to my hair as a leave in, also use it on my face and body. It makes my hair stronger and extremly smooth,it's lightweight and not greasy at all.I am african american and I can use this oil on my face with no problem of break outs. My skin  is smooth  and silky.<br />For nutrition I make salad dressings,smoothies,or take a 1TB of the oil. You can get recipes on YouTube or health blogs ...<br /><br />The only problem with this product is the packaging.They ship the oil in a small box so It's laying sideways and only 1inflated bubble wrap . Not enough protection ! That is why I didn't give it a higher rating.",0
"The assortment and taste is very good, but they were order and delivered in the Summer and they smell like they were in a fire.  It doesn't affect the taste, but the smoke smell is very noticeable.  Maybe they shouldn't be sent in hot weather or should be packed differently.",0
"I like it, but.... there's a little bit too much of a sharp after taste. Even adding a ton of sugar didn't make up for it entirely. The product still has good flavor, but I'd gladly take Lipton Spiced Chai over this, if only the Lipton came in a K-Cup.",0
"Not a bad taste, but dry as..?.. some kind of food that is equally dry. Not bad with a glass of milk though.",0
"These boxes are tiny.  The size Jelly Belly Beans sells for $1.29.  They are fun for Harry Potter fans, but way overpriced.",0
"I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.",0
"I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.",0
"I liked these and the ingredients and vitamins seemed good (even though a tad too sweet) but..everytime I'd eat one I'd become ill.  I couldn't figure out why until I researched the ingredients.  I'm moderately to severely allergic to MSG and it gets worse as I get older.  I kept reading the ingredients wondering if there was something in these affecting me and after a little internet research found that the ""Maltodextrin, Brown Rice Syrup, Natural Flavorings, Whey Protein Isolate and possibly a few other ingredients contain varying amounts of MSG.  The combination of all these was enough to make me sick.  I'll have to stick to snacks without such a high combination as other snacks haven't had such an effect on me. They did taste good, however... :(",0
"These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten-free breads and crackers use egg as the lacking ""glue""...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken/tuna salad...sigh.",0
"This is truly a mid-range iced coffee.<br /><br />I've lived overseas and drank coffee out of vending machines that dispensed quality iced coffee. Illy's offering is pretty good if one like coffee that isn't drenched in cream and sugar. I can't say the flavor is my favorite, but it is good enough for occasional drinking. I wouldn't consider this an energy drink. If you like strong coffee flavor and don't mind the price tag, then you should enjoy this beverage.",0
"These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.",0
"The middle jar was shattered. Glass against glass is a bad idea. No returns on this product, and no leave feedback button. I love this stuff, but the packing is lacking.",0
"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.",0
"These Cup Noodles are super easy to prepare and easy to eat out of the cup. I was drawn to this variety because of the shrimp, since I don't like chicken or beef noodles.  However, they taste like chicken or beef or pork or a mixture of the above. I didn't taste shrimp at all.  A dash of soy sauce helped the flavor.<br /><br />The noodles stay firm long enough to eat them all, without getting mushy like some pasta products.  There are a few dried peas and carrots in the mixture, but it really wouldn't hurt to toss in some leftover vegetables if you have them handy.<br /><br />Overall, they are quick to prepare and very inexpensive, so you really can't go wrong with them.<br /><br />As it turned out, they reason they tasted meatier to me is because they do contain chicken and pork.  Hopefully this ingredient list will be useful to other shoppers.<br /><br />Ingredients: Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Vegetable Oil (Contains One or More of the Following: Canola Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Palm Oil, Rice Oil), Preserved by Tocopherols and/or TBHQ and/or Ascorbyl Palmitate, Salt, Dehydrated Vegetables (Carrot, Green Pea), Freeze-Dried Shrimp, Soy Sauce Powder (Wheat, Soybeans, Maltodextrin, Salt), Monosodium Glutamate, Hydrolyzed Soy, Corn and Wheat Protein, Spices, Caramel Color, Potassium Carbonate, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Pork Powder, Garlic Powder, Natural Flavors, Chicken Powder, Sodium Alginate, Disodium Succinate, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Shrimp Powder, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Cod Liver Oil.",0
"This is a tasty drink that is all natural.  However, a small 8.3 ounce can contains a relatively high 140 calories which is roughly the same number of calories in a 12 ounce Coke.  Only, a Coke is about 50% larger in volume.<br /><br />I like sweet, but to me this is a bit too sweet.  It might be nice as a mixer in an adult beverage though.  I haven't tried to mix it, but you could probably make a nice fruity alcoholic drink out of it.<br /><br />The price isn't a bargain.  At nearly $1 per can, as of this writing, it wouldn't seem to be a compelling value.  I do like it, but I doubt I'd purchase it again.  It also left a bit of a lingering metallic aftertaste that I wasn't thrilled about.  Still, if you don't mind the calories, enjoy a beverage that is sweet and are looking for a natural drink, then this could be worth considering.",0
"I've had raisin bran from various brands, from growing up on various cereal that popped up on sale, but I don't remember any of them having as many raisins as Kellogg's Raisin Bran! It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not. Maybe it might be a new program and Amazon still has old stock.",0
"Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)",0
"I love Betty Crocker GF mixes, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found it to have kind of an odd aftertaste, and the cookies just didn't hold together for me at all. I tried it using crisco grease, then again tried it using butter, then even tried it using cooking oil, but the cookies just spread out too thin no matter what I did. I tried removing them from the parchment paper warm and removing them completely cooled -- no difference. They just fall apart.  Makes a good ice cream topping, or great for using as a creative decoration on top of a birthday cake, though.",0
we bought the jelly belly flops and most were popcorn flavored which i absolutely abhor..would recommend just buying flavors you know instead of the hodgepodge mix.,0
"I started breastfeeding our son right away and realized that if I had several more bottles that would fit the breastpump, I could store it in the fridge right after or feed it too him if I was too sore. However, even though I bought Lansinoh bottles to use with a Lansinoh pump, when I used the bottles to feed him, for some reason the nipples would pop off thus spilling all over and wasting all the milk and making for a happy baby. I tried every nipple and everyone of them seemed like they didn't quite fit well enough. So now all I use the extra bottles for are pumping (in case the others are dirty and I don't want to clean them). Useful but probably wouldn't buy again.",0
"I love 2 in 1 coffee, it's usually the perfect amount of sugar and milk for a cup, but this product is just not like the others I've tried. The coffee is stronger, and not as smooth in flavor, I sometimes compensate by adding additional sugar.  The product itself made in China, something I try to avoid.",0
"I loved these dried strawberries.  In fact after I started munching on them right out of the container I had a hard time stopping.  It was sort of like eating potato chips, ""Bet you can't eat just one!""  The only problem I have had is that once opened you probably should get rid of them quickly because the container lid just does not keep out the moisture and after a relatively short time you are eating something less than dried berries, more like potato chips which had laid around open for a few days.",0
"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",0
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",0
This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.,0
"As claimed in ads this corn is for added flavoring such as caramel. If purchased for popping and eating 'as-is' you'll discover wonderfully huge corn puffs with NO TASTE. The ads are correct, buy to flavor or not I'm not intentionally criticizing this corn, the mistake I made was assuming it would taste as great as it looks, without caramel.",0

"Holy Schnikes!! The price today is 4 times what I paid for one of these at the Mart a few days ago!! So that means for 2 cans it's twice the price, Unless the price drops to about seven dollars per can with no shipping, it's not worth it. I paid under seven for my 18.5oz can...and they're over half almonds and cashews...I don't mind almonds, but I'm not a big cashew fan (I know, weird) I love all the others the best. :) However, they are getting 3 stars because the quality of the nuts was great - if you don't mind that cashews and almonds are the new ""peanuts"" of no peanut nut mixes - then you'll be fine!",0
"I found the Sumatra to be bitter, I like my coffee black and strong. It's cool though, there are so many other Starbucks Coffee's I do like. I'm glad I tried Sumatra, it received alot of positive reviews, it's just not for me.",0
"Some highlights:<br />* Not too sweet, just right<br />* Not too salty either<br />* Some clusters like would be in granola, but not many<br />* Doesn't smell like vanilla or blueberry at all<br /><br />Overall, it has a bland and unremarkable taste.  I have tried much better granola in the past with a better nutritional profile.<br />Actually, it's hard to assess the nutritional profile since the ""Nutrition Facts"" do not show accurate data.  For example, one of the ingredients is Vitamin E, but it's not listed under the nutrition facts.  Which makes me think that anything could be there (or not be there).<br /><br />Also, the smell when I opened the package was anything but appealing.  No hints of vanilla or blueberries.",0
"I was expected a lot better. i LOVE the beef jerkey nuggets they are so juicy n flavorful and delicious, but when i ordered these just to try them cause i couldnt find them in any store i wasnt too happy. when i tried them they were extremely greasy and not that much flavor.",0
"I read about these for weight loss among other benefits and thought I'd try them.  Make sure you know they are related to the tomato and chili pepper more than a normal ""berry"" because they taste more like a bit of dried tomato than a sweet fruit.  Easy to lose weight with them when they taste like dried tomato- make it your only available food :)",0
For a while this was the only way I could find the amount of Crystal Light that I needed.  Now I can find it cheaper at Sam's club.  Still love the product,0
"I have to admit I am having a hard time deciding on a final score for this product. Like many pet owners I want to give my cat the best, I try to make sure she has a healthy diet and I also feel better knowing I am feeding her a healthy product and not something full of chemicals that nobody without a phd can pronounce.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Blue Buffalo dry food as it touts an impressive list of natural ingredients that are both wholesome and nutritious. Sadly when I tried to incorporate small amounts of it into my Lily's diet, she was having none of it. She would pick around it to get to her usual dry food and leave the Blue Buffalo uneaten. Finally I had to give up and went back to just feeding her fancy feast select dry food.<br /><br />Thinking that perhaps it just was not to her taste I tried giving some to my mother in laws three cats, two of the three turned their noses up at it as well while the third a cranky fat cat named Moe did decide to chow down on it.... then again Moe also will eat bugs if he can run them down fast enough, perhaps he's not a good test subject.<br /><br />In the end, even though I am impressed with the food it comes down to the cats. What good is terrific ingredients if they just will not eat it? I wonder if most older cats have come to be used to the standard mix of cat food ingredients most brands seem to use. If you have a cat coming of age and need to start them on dry food this may be a good option, but for me it just didn't work out.<br /><br />Lily gives this product three paws up, it's a nice effort... just not the cats meow.",0
"I always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when I'm in a hurry and don't have any time to prepare things. One of my long-time favorites is the Maruchan Instant Lunch cups and I presently have the beef flavor. They also come in several other flavors. The cost is minimal. They're real easy to prepare real. Just peel back the top, add hot water and let it set for about three minutes. Have a few things like cheese, fruits, meat along with your noodle soup and, viola, an instant lunch. Works real well and is tasty. My only reservation is the very high salt (sodium) content. It's listed at 1,200mg, which is about 50% of the daily recommendation. In one serving! Wow! It's an easy and quick lunch, but you'd better watch your other salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0

"The flavor was very good, I would have given it a higher rating but this is not something I would usually eat.",0
"First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star.",0
"These are the same cookies you can get at some costcos across the country, but not at mine, so I was very happy to find an alternative source.<br />However, true to so many of amazons items, the picture does not match the product.

"I love good coffee.  So when I picked up this Starbucks Natural Fusion Ground Vanilla I was excited just to open it up and smell it. To make a long story short, I kept making excuses for the coffee several pots later and half way through the bag it sits on the shelf.  I've actually considered tossing it out but it's not terrible. So I'll use it when I run out of other brews or when I have guest who just wants an average cup of non flavored coffee. I've never heard, ""oh this is Vanilla?""<br /><br />I made excuses for this brew because it is ""Natural Fusion"".  The thinking being that it was organic and little or no chemical process used, but even if that's true it just tastes average and hardly like the Vanilla flavored beans I normally use.<br /><br />Sorry Starbucks.",0

"My dog loves these, and when we first adopted him it was all he would eat, but they were just so expensive.  I tried several brands, and found a much cheaper brand at Wal-mart of all places, and he loves them.",0
"They taste great but you're getting a package of ice cream about the size of a roll of quarters. Taste yummy, terrible value.",0
"This is a good-quality smoked paprika and will work well in just about any dish you need it for.  BUT, the container is quite small and contains only 2.6 oz.  For less than a dollar more ($.64, to be exact), you can get McCormick's version, which tastes virtually the same, and you get 8.5 oz. - which is three times as much. In addition, like the Chiquilin, the McCormick paprika is made from Spanish red peppers that are smoked over wood planks.  Finally, it is available with Prime shipping, just as the Chiquilin is.",0
"Simply based on taste, I give this ""Peach Tea"" flavored water-enhancer a pretty good rating. It's certainly a lot better than Crystal Light or some of those other powders. I'm health conscious and drink pretty much nothing but water and the occasional carrot juice. After a while, I do admit, water can start to taste bland. I would occasionally like to drink something sweet without having to worry about all the sugar. Enter this MIO stuff, which seemed like it could fit the bill: in theory.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist, so I don't know how actually healthy this stuff is. My guess is that it's not healthy at all. Generally speaking, anything that tastes this sweet is not good for you. Here are the ingredients: Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium(Sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Polysorbate 60, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />So yeah, a bunch of stuff I've never heard of plus some icky dyes. Personally, I'd just rather drink up a nice cool glass of purified water. It feels clean and tastes good, unlike MIO which is sweet and feels sugary going down. But, if for some reason you simply MUST drink something sweet, these little juice-it-ups might help out. Overall, I'd never spend a dime on them. And I DEFINITELY wouldn't spend $6 for a little bottle. But, because it was tasty, I do give it a solid average rating.",0
"The price was good and delivery was fast on this order, but every bar in the package was broken.",0
"I'm really confused by the reviewers claiming they couldn't wash the smell off.  When first opened the bag smells EXACTLY like old edamame.  The fact that it smells like something that is also food helped me get past it a little. I put the noodles in a colander and ran hot water over them for less than a minute while tossing them around with my hands.  That removed the smell completely.  I think the assertion that they taste ""rubbery"" is a little strong.  There certainly chewy, but in the same way that bean sprouts or limp celery is chewy.  It's basically true that they take on the taste of your sauce, though, having prepared them in beef broth with hot sauce, it didn't really seem like they were absorbing the flavor so much as they were just coated in it.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have is that you really don't get all that much volume for your money.  A whole package makes slightly more than a brick of Top-Ramen soup--at 2.50 a package the calorie savings are really the only thing it has going for it.  For the same price, I could eat a whole ton of carrots or green beans, which I find way more satisfying and would be only a trifle more caloric.  I guess I figured shiritaki noodles would be better than carrots at answering my carb craving, but they're really not.  So ultimately, I liked the product, but I probably wouldn't buy again for price reasons.<br /><br />Also, and I'm not sure how this should influence buying decisions overall, but one of the bags popped and leaked its smelly juice all over the box in shipping.  To make matters worse, the noodles were part of an order that contained some electronics that were (thankfully) shrink wrapped.  Still, unpacking everything from a pool of shiritaki juice was nightmare.",0
"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!",0
"On arrival, I distributed a chew to each of three dogs under 20 pounds who do like chews.  They each went at their chew with a will, and in 15 minutes the chews were gone.  As the chewing was in progress, and lingering, was a distinct odor similar to horse weeds and other strong herbs.  I cannot say how ""dental"" the experience was, for such a quick gulp.  If one of the purposes of the chew is to occupy a pet for any extended time, this choice is a flop--but it must have been tasty.",0
"...this is not their best product.  I have been an ardent devourer of Mestemacher breads ever since my trip to Germany 3 years ago. This was my first time ordering the Rye & Spelt (to shake things up) and while it is enjoyable, it's definitely not my favorite. It's on the drier, more crumbly side (vs. the 3-Grain, Fitness and Sunflower varieties)and the flavor is decent.",0
"I recently purchased DisposaKups from this seller! Not only did I receive great customer service and fast shipping, but my product came packaged perfectly. I absolutely love the idea of the DisposaKups. However, after using a few, they just don't live up to my expectations. The lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing, sometimes the holes don't poke properly, and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it brews. Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill.",0
"After all of the hype about how wonderfully hot and flavorful ghost peppers are; all i can say is - meh, average, mediocre, nothing much to get excited about. I have to say that i was disappointed with this product.<br /><br />I have previously had the Mad Dog 6M scoville - it was much hotter and much better tasting than the pure ghost.<br />In comparison the pure ghost sauce is honestly no hotter than a bottle of habanero Tabasco; although it does have better flavor than the Tabasco.<br /><br />Save your money - buy the Mad Dog 6m Scoville sauce instead if you're looking for something with really good heat and flavor.<br /><br />3 out of 5 for this product as hot sauces go and that's being a little generous cause I like this brand.",0
"No doubt, this is a tasty product.  Nice portion size, no mess, great calorie point and very convenient.  Unfortunately, for me, they are a bit expensive.  Even at Amazon's discounted price, one is paying over $.10 an olive!  I'll save these for travel, or when it's convenient, but not for every day snacking.  For that, I'll stick to packing 15 olives into a small plastic container.",0
"While the wasabi flavor of these peas was strong, and they were hot and sweet both at the same time, the peas were super hard, many were so dry they just disintegrated when they were bitten into. Also, the majority of the peas were not whole--they were broken pieces, half of a pea, chunks of dried peas, but not whole, round, pretty peas. I realize wasabi peas are dried--I love wasabi peas and I eat them all the time--but these were super hard and super dry, like dusty inside when bitten into.<br /><br />Also, no nutritional label or ingredients information was provided with the peas... and the packaging was ordinary, normal plastic bags, with no information, labels, printing, anything on them to say what they were. I would imagine the bags are filled from larger bulk bags, but some sort of ingredients or nutritional labeling should have come with the product.<br /><br />So while the flavor was good, the texture and the size and the consistency of the product was poor. They were okay, and I did eat them, but I honestly probably wouldn't order them again from this seller. I've ordered others from Amazon.com sellers that were much better, and I would likely go back to them before ordering from here again.",0
"While this product is great, I will not be purchasing it here as it is WAY too expensive. 29$ + 12$ shipping? Come on!",0
"I myself do like these but others may wish to take note. These bears are not sweet tasting at all. They are slightly chewy and really very sticky so if you have dentures, loose teeth or just don't like things sticking to your teeth you may want to pick something different. Would not be good for small children either.",0
"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.",0
"Yes I understand that these aren't perfectly cut, and some of the pieces smell a little.<br />That's not the problem I had with them to rate this bag only 3 stars.<br /><br />Bag consisted of a lot of pig ears, a lot of cow tails, something that looks like a honey bun, a 3 inch GI bone, and a huge hoof of some sort. Most of the pig ears/cow tails are the consistency of pork rinds (human food, very fluffy and crunchy).<br /><br />The pieces other than the hoof and GI bone, are NOT ""long lasting"" chews AT ALL. The pig ears you buy from walmart that are thin last at least 3 times as long as the ones in this package. I would rather buy those for my dog to chew on.<br /><br />The only pros I could find about this bag is, because the consistency is more fluffy and crumbly, the chews are probably digested easier than the rawhides you buy from walmart. Also, the fact that I got probably 30 pieces, makes it SOUND like a good deal.<br /><br />But overall, Hungry Dog was not worth the money for what I received, and definitely did not meet NEAR my expectations.",0
"After searching around for affordable imported amarena cherries, these Roland brand cherries came up at Amazon. Because of the great price and the fact that they seemed ""authentic"", i decided to purchase them -- all seven pounds of them. Unfortunately, the cherries don't have that richness of the Fabbri brand, and the syrup is more ""medicine"" like than I was hoping (almost too much like that old cherry tylenol taste I recall as a kid). The cherries were chewy but didn't release a lot of juice; and there is no visible expiration date on the large can, though the copyright date is 2004. Basically I feel that they are a glorified darker version of maraschino cherries with a thicker syrup. if you want a real amarena experience, stick with the more expensive Fabbri brand for sure. Or, find out what brand of amarena cherry is used at Carnevino restaurant in Vegas... that's where i first learned about amarene, and they changed they way i think about cocktails!",0
"Received the ""the best of Ghirardelli Gift Basket,""  was giving it as a gift.  Looked fulled in the picture, also instead of being set(as per picture) all the chocalate was in a pile inside the red basket covered in plastic.  You had to ripe the plastic open to try to set it up to make it look presentable and then nothingheld the way it was shown. It looked like a mess and not a great gift basket",0
"As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say ""Product of USA."" This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.",0
"It is always fun to get a gift box or basket but the Wine.com box needs a better presentation.<br /><br />This gift box includes small quantities of upscale food items. Included in the box are; Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt, a small jar of mustard, 2 squares of Ghirardelli chocolate, cocoa, cheese straws, wafer crackers, a small bag of chocolate chip cookies, a round of cheese wedges and a small knife. One concern I had was on the cheese. I was unable to track down the company that makes it to ask how long it could last without refrigeration. But I did call a rival cheese company who shared that if unopened some of their cheeses could last a year without refrigeration. So hopefully this is the same.<br /><br />It is really hard to judge the value of a gift basket or box. I have sent flowers that were quite pricey that lost their bloom in a week yet delighted the recipient. Just recently I sent a fruit gift, from a popular fruit company, which included 6-8 pears, 6-8 oranges and 6-8 apples. It was on special but still pricey at around $60. The person on the receiving end was thrilled. With gift baskets there is a tendency to pay much more than the actual value of the items included. And a lot of it has to with presentation. Giving a fruit basket for example, is more exciting than say handing a person a bag of apples from the grocery store with best wishes. And getting one can be so exciting.<br /><br />And that is where the Wine.com basket fails. For ease of transportation, the goodies are packaged in a cardboard box with nutmeg colored paper shavings. This is placed in a larger box to prevent any damage which is nice. However, the red wrap and gold bow are not on the box. It is just a plain cardboard box.<br /><br />The packaging is substantial and fine but it is just not exciting. And presentation means a lot when it comes to gift baskets. So I have to ask myself would I be excited if I were on the receiving end of this gift instead of having received it as a Vine review product and my thought is, ""It's ok"". It is just not exciting.",0
These are a great value if you don't care what flavors you get.  I bought 4 bags:  1 was almost entirely licorice; 2 others primarily sours.  Fun to eat the different shapes but be aware that the flavors may not be to your taste.,0
If you can't understand why the product measures same as sugar then pick up a bag of equal size and you will notice this in volume is light as a feather. The bag is larger than a 5 pound bag of sugar. It works very well and there is no deception. Check it out.,0
Bought this for Sunday Easter because eating the alphabet could be more fun than plain gummy bears. But after receiving them I realized that the alphabet letters are huge in size compared to the gummy bears or skittle. A child can't put one in his/her mouth like a gummy bear or skittle. That's the only complaint I have. A letter can fit in (maybe) a circle that is 2 or 2.5 inches in diameter. They are probably as good as the gummy bears.,0
"I have a Lab who is a moderate chewer (toys only). I gave her the treat ball one day for about 45 minutes and then took it away for bedtime.  The second time I gave her the ball with the same treat, she had the treat out in about a half hour and ate the whole treat in minutes. I would not recommend leaving your pooch with this without supervision - once she removed it, the treat was big enough that my dog could have choked on it while eating it.",0
"Hempseed is a great summplement to my diet.  It's much easier to take than flax seed and it taste good too.  Nutiva is Ok for the price, but I would have to say Manitoba is much better but you pay for it.  I've found in the Nutiva some of the shells are still on the on seeds and the taste is not as fresh or nutty as others.  When buying hempseeds I generally buy Manitoba, but when it comes time to restocking I sometimes get lured by the price of Nutiva.  Nutiva isn't bad, it's pretty good and if you haven't tried Manitoba then you wouldn't even know any better!",0
"My little one, a super small Pom, loves these!  We first discovered these at the Pet Feed Store.  They last her a long time and keep her occupied when I absolutely need her to be still and quiet!  However, this batch I ordered from Amazon just didn't have the same quality.  They were so dried out and hollow in places, like they were old stock or something.  I can't tell you exactly what the difference is, but there is one!  So much for getting a bargain!  I'd rather pay more and get ones that aren't so old and already deteriorating.",0

"I feel a little bit guilty giving this 3 stars considering that I've never had a true appletini made by a real bartender, so I've nothing to compare it to taste-wise. However, I can't justify giving it a higher rating because I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.<br /><br />Taste-wise this wasn't bad. It's very much on the tart side, which I usually like in my drinks and there's a decent flavor here. At times the drink just seemed a little too tart and I can see where people who don't like very sour things wouldn't really be as into this drink. People who are comparing it to a Jolly Rancher are pretty much spot on. I kept thinking that it reminded me of something and when I saw that others thought it reminded them of this candy, I couldn't help but think ""that's it exactly!""<br /><br />This just seemed a little too artificial at times for my taste, too much like a packet of grown-up Kool-Aid. This might be what this drink essentially is, but Crystal Light is pretty great at making instant drinks so I did have some pretty high expectations going into this. I'll probably still end up checking out the other flavors and this is still a pretty decent drink overall. I think if I were to add something to it or dilute the drink a little more then maybe it'd be a little better for me.<br /><br />Overall this was a decent enough drink but I'd hesitate to make it a staple of my household beverage drinking.",0
"I've been buying these mints since August 2010.  They were a subscribe and save item that we got twice a month. The mint taste was not always consistent, with some boxes very strong tasting and some with a mild mint taste, but we accepted that.<br /><br />However, the last box we got in July 2012 ended our two year relationship with Newman's Own Cinnamon mints. Here's the story: I opened the box, took a roll and handed a roll to my husband.  We each popped a mint in our mouths.  I few seconds later we looked at each other and both said ""They taste like soap!"" I don't know what happened in the manufacturing process, but that ended it for us.  Amazon was good enough to refund our money when I contacted them.  I cancelled our subscription and we're afraid to order any more.<br /><br />I'm rating this product 3 stars instead of one because we got a lot of boxes that were great. We just can't get past that last box.",0

"I had to soak this for at least 8-10 minutes before it became tender enough to use in the cooking process.  I do love rice noodles and cook them up regularly, they are usually thicker so this is a nice alternative if you wish to make a more delicate dish. These were ok in texture but a bit gummy if over cooked in sauce. I made a black bean and pepper dish which was good as a side. Nice sized bag for 2 people for main dish or you can use twice for side dishes.",0
"This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%.",0
"It has good flavor, but I do not think that it lived uo to all that I read that it was. I could have just bought some pure vanilla exctract and saved $10 and 5 days of waiting.<br />I do love its thickness and texture, but I wouldn't buy it again unless I saw it on a store shelf. It wasn't worth the wait and the shipping cost.",0
This tea smells AMAZING. I love whenever I pull open my drawer at work and catch a whiff of it. The taste is subtle..some may like that but I would enjoy a little more flavor from this tea.,0
It's hard to say if this product has had any kind of calming affect.<br /><br />It's not hard to say if this product affects your bathroom experience.  It does!  Be careful how much you take.,0
"Ive enjoyed this product for some time now and decided to get it a bit cheaper from Amazon than from my grocery here in NY. Apparently they offer the cheaper price since all of the cans are dented, which is not from shipping. Cans in the middle are also dented. Every last one. Would be 4-5 stars if not for this. Ive read articles relating to health risks posed by dented cans, even if not fully punctured.",0

"I guess the idea here is that you can reward your dog with quick and tasty lick of a thin liquid on a roller ball. Seems like a decent idea, especially if you're trying to train your dog.<br /><br />The problem, in our case anyway, is that our dog is sort of lukewarm on this treat. He'll lick it sometimes, but other times, he just isn't interested. I asked him why, but he declined to comment.",0
"I was quite disappointed in the flat taste of this product. There was a lot of meat, however, but the sauce and potatoes seemed to be rather lackluster in appearance and taste. I finally mixed 2 packages with some brown gravy, added a bit of blended seasoning and brought it to life. I would not buy this product again.",0
"I used this for a month, but not sure that it really helps me. When my baby started to burp up milk, I stopped using it to eliminate the cause.

Hence, I am not sure whether this helps or not, but I would not discourage people from using it since many of my friends have used it with successful.",0
"I actually like this tea, but I did give it three stars for a couple of reasons. The tea, in my opinion, is average... nothing really to set it apart... three stars is average... The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.",0
"I am not a big fan of artificially flavored drinks, and this vitamin squeeze energy drink is no exception. I really don't like the aftertaste of such drinks. However, putting that aside, this is a fairly refreshing and nice-tasting drink as far as it goes. The flavor is a bit reminiscent of a cough syrup. The packaging and mixing are very convenient - I was surprised that you really didn't need any stirring or shaking for this solution to completely dissolve in water. This drink is a convenient option if you spend a lot of time in a place that has plenty of water fountains or water coolers, and very limited refrigerator space. Aside from the interesting packaging and the delivery method there is nothing all that special about this drink that would distinguish it form others in the same category.",0
I love good coffee with rich flavor that doesn't hint of burnt beans. This coffee delivered in that it had an OK flavor without tasting burnt but a felt it was a little more acidic then I prefer. It wasn't a super smooth coffee but it wasn't bad for a quick cup. I don't think I'll be getting this again as I do prefer to grind my own beans but it was a nice change.,0
THESE TREATS ARE MORE FOR A LARGER DOG AS THEY ARE VERY HARD AND THICK.  THE GIRLS (my maltese) LIKE THEM EXCEPT WAY TOO BIG AND HARD TO CHEW FOR THEM..,0
"For convenience, this is excellent. Everything comes individually wrapped with expiration dates beyond that printed on the box. It even includes a wrapped fork and a Sudoku puzzle on the box bottom. Some may complain about excessive packaging, but it does keep the contents dry. I stuck mine in with some fruit and the outer box soaked up some moisture and became damp, so I appreciate the individual packaging.<br /><br />For taste, this falls a little short. The salmon spread did have a slight chili flavor but very little lime taste. The texture was strange--somewhat mushy and like a gritty jelly. There was a definite fishiness. The crackers were OK; they were similar to Ritz crackers. I have had the edamame before and they were as expected. To me, the best part was the fruit and nut mix. It has a nice flavor although I did not get many banana bits.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the meal was underwhelming. It was not enough to fill me. I thought it was a little expensive for the amount of food.",0
"This tea is fine, but not a chai favorite for me.  I don't think that I would purchase it again, but I will finish up the box.",0
"The combination sounded wonderful and the picture was enticing but that isn't exactly what I received.  The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)",0
"Love the coffee, however, I can buy this product cheaper at our Kroger grocery store.",0
Not the best nor the worst.  In the middle of the road.  Slightly bitter finish.  Bold brew smell but flavor is somewhat lacking.,0
"I bought this, not for its gluten-free feature, but because I though the protein content would be high.  Quinoa is known for its really high protein content. However, a word of caution (probably my fault that i did not read the finer print properly) but this is a corn-quinoa mix.  My usual whole grain pasta actually has 75% more protein and 50% more fiber than this quinoa pasta. So really I regret buying it. However, taste wise, it's similar enough to wheat pasta but does not keep the tight neat shape of regular rotelle. I think it would be nice for those bound to a gluten-free diet.",0
"The good: the beef is cut thickly and has a steak-y taste.<br />The bad: the jerky is extremely salty to the point that it made me feel ill if I ate more than a few pieces.<br />About me: I am a rabid jerk-o-phile, and I regularly consume mass quantities of the stuff.",0
"Really like this soup,but spoon by spoon-it gets hotter and hotter! Why in God's name did Bear Creek have to ruin this soup by putting way too much pepper in it? It's not necessary for them to add this amount of pepper to their mix-not eveybody likes this much pepper in their soup!If the consumer wants more pepper,they can add it themselves.You know the saying-you can always add it,but you can't take it out.SUCH a dissappointment...........",0
I have been making my way through different sardine brands and finally tried these. I enjoy the regular US brands of mustard sardines. I found these to be a little overboard on the mustard for my tastes. I would estimate there was approximately 3 tablespoons of a thick Dijon mustard in the package. The mustard just dominated everything and I tried to remove as much as of the mustard as possible.,0
"I bought this product last year, and it was great. I anxiously awaited the release of it this season, and when I got it, was very disappointed by how weak it is. It was a rich full coffee last year. This year, although there is a good pumpkin spice flavor,the coffee itself is weak.",0
"This is a pretty sweet soda that's made from fruit juices without additives.  I thought it was ok but nothing to write home about.  It tastes more like sparkling-green-apple (but not tart) than fruit punch, and reminds ME a little of the way I remember SLICE tasting (I don't eat Jolly Ranchers.)  It's not super carbonated, which I like.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that this is a small (but not mini) can - 8.3 fluid ounces as opposed to a typical soda in a 12 fl oz can.  Presumably the point is to get the kiddiewinks off the high-sugar sodas, and as other folks've pointed out, this 8.3 can of The Switch has 140 calories and 36 grams of carbs - and 35g of sugar, though it's 'natural' sugars.  That compares to 150 calories, 42g carbs, and 42g sugars in my 12 oz Cherry Coke.  I think I'll make the switch - back.",0
"This is a high quality tea, but if you really like the original and double spice Stash Chai you might want to avoid this one.  I drink about 3 cups of the original chai a day, and thought this would be a nice change for the holidays.  It is really different.  The flavor is totally different and I didn't like it at all.  I threw out most of the box unused.  I gave it 3 stars since it is a high quality tea with good ingredients, I just didn't like it at all (personal taste).",0
"I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.",0
I had purchased these at Walmart before and loved them. But when I used the first one the rice was quite a bit dryer then the walmart purchase. I don't know whether since they were bought in bulk they sat in a warehouse or what happened. I probably won't purchase them this way again. Sorry.,0
"I bought this cereal thinking I was buying an amazing product for my child...gotta try and be that supermom ya know :). I took it into her pediatrition to make sure that there was nothing too crazy in this cereal and she said basically it is just playing up all of the things that these cereals normally have in them. She said it may have a little bit different of percentages when comparing it to say a Gerber cereal but its practically the same thing. Now I personally love that this is organic and the Happy Bellies brand is one that I really like for my daughter. She doesnt however seem to like the taste of this cereal unless mixed with applesauce and/or added to a large quantity of formula or breastmilk. Overall I think this product is average for an organic cereal, however the price point is reasonable enough. I would say you dont need to go out of your way to purchase this but if your in the market for a higher end brand of cereal for your little one, you could give this a try.",0
"If I had to say anything about PG Tips, compared to its main rival, Tetley, is just a feeling of something is lacking. My tea background is mostly one of drinking the amazing thing called Barry's Tea Gold Blend but I have been looking to branch out a little bit lately. Having ordered a few brands, I taste tested PG Tips using boiled Pur Filtered water; when drinking PG tips after brewed for 4 to 5 mins, the flavor just drops out. British tea is traditionally a little bit lighter than what the Irish prefer to drink so I was expecting a lighter and little less complex taste..<br /><br />There is no real finish to your sip, it just stops about midway through the pallet then then it's just nothing. Rather disappointing.",0
"The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.<br /><br />That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem.",0
"I purchased this as a gift for someone.  The box is a nice sized box, however, the box itself does not look like the one in the advertised photo. The paint, which is supposedly hand painted, is not as deep in color and detail as in the photo and the roses are not as defined as in the photo.  I expected this gourmet ""food"" gift basket to be that!  There is no food, and since it is a gift basket, I expected the items to be displayed coming out of the box as in the photo to make it attractive looking.  The items inside are packed inside with the box lid closed.  I found this gift was nice, but was a little disappointed in it.  I also thought it was a bit pricey at $60.",0
"There's the tradeoff.<br /><br />Yes, it's delicious, and the baby loves it. At over $3 per cup, it's also incredibly expensive, and I haven't seen any options to buy in bulk. As noted, it comes delivered in a huge styrofoam cooler, which ends up in your trash, the landfill and/or the ocean for every 12 cup variety pack you buy.<br /><br />So, the question is what's more important to you - the fact that it's delicious, or the fact that it's expensive.",0
"Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.",0
"As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court",0
"I have been on the search for an erythritol or xylitol sweetened chocolate for a while.  I found this on amazon and was thrilled that it is sweetened with xylitol.  The $14.99 price tag freaked me out a little, but I took the plung anyway.  Well, the bag is really, really small.  You don't get much chocolate for that hefty $14.99 price.  Maybe a dozen little individually wrapped chocolates.  I guess I should have read the description better, or I fooled myself into thinking each piece of chocolate was bigger than it is. The chocolate tastes pretty good, has a bit of a crunch to it.  It doesn't melt in your mouth like other 60% and higher cocoa bars do.  If it were cheaper, I would probably buy more to see if I could cook with it.  However, had I known just how small the bag is, and just how few pieces of chocolate I was getting, I would not have purchased this.  I gave it 3 stars because it does taste good, but it is just way too pricey for what you get.  If you have a diabetic friend and want to splurge on a treat, this would be a nice gift.",0
"I just got these in the mail.  Sorry, but they don't taste the same.  I'm not sure why.  The ones that were<br />made here years ago tasted like regular M&Ms filled with rice crispy-like stuff.  This filling<br />is similar in texture but I don't think it is the same material.  That is disappointing.<br /><br />Yes, the bags are small.  Remember, they are coming from Germany so you are paying a<br />premium for them.  Hopefully, they'll make them again in the U. S.<br /><br />Ok on further reflection, the inside is ok.  I think it is the coating that is odd.  When I opened the bag I could smell<br />somethink like hazelnut and kind of got that flavor from the candy.  Normally I like hazelnut but NOT in these.  I hear we will<br />be getting Crispy M&M's in the U.S. sometime in 2012.  Great!<br /><br />Ok it's Aug 2012 and still no US version.  I emailed M&M but no reply so far.  I did end up eating them and have a tip.  Rub the candy shell with a kleenex before popping it in your mouth.  It helps.  Its like it has an odd-tasting oil coating it.  I think candy makers do put a top coat on for shine and whatever they use in Germany tastes different than what they use here.  Yes, its still very expensive but if you have a craving, go ahead.",0
"This is not bad, but be aware there is relish added to it. It tends to stop up, then come out in massive quantities.",0
"I think that this Chai Tea has a very good flavor.  All of the spices mesh well without the tea coming out with an overtly cinnamon flavor.  That being said, it's a very weak tea.  I've steeped it for 5 minutes and it is still really weak in flavor.  If you like a strong Chai Tea, this won't be for you!",0
I ordered Davinci Pasta-12 packages.  Nine packages were opened and flowing freely in the box.<br />I opted to scoop and rebag.  Very disappointed in packaging. Amazon just reboxed instead of<br />perhaps dealing with the Davinci Company. Although the pasta is what I needed I will not<br />order from Davinci again.<br />Laura Steele Crownover,0
It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner,0
"Great idea and you can taste the difference in wine after poring it through the aerator. But if you put it on the tower and even a tall wine glass under it, wine sprays all over the place but not into the glass. You must tilt the aerator to prevent it.  Design could have been a lot better if they have tried to pour wine as it is. Buy just the aerator; the tower is just a piece of decoration.",0
"***<br />This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.<br />***",0
"Although I'm a big fan of International Delight's flavorful creamers,I must admit that I was unhappy with the condition the package arrived in. I received the box with at least 3 of the singles containers spilled in the box. Needless to say, the creamer carton was damaged and soaked(damp upon receipt). I also noticed that when opening the creamers for use, each single serving had a large number of tiny solidified cream pieces, which made me wonder whether they were still fresh.. Since they're still drinkable, I would give this item a little below average score...",0
"These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.",0
"Such tiny portions!  Individually wrapped portions<br />are so small!  They are convenient to drop into<br />someone's lunch, but you'd be better off buying<br />small bags of chips instead - you'd get more for<br />the money.",0
"I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.",0
"This drink has the rich taste of Illy coffee slightly sweetened with sugar. When I saw that it was pre-sweetened I expected that it might be overly sweet, but that isn't the case; the taste of the coffee comes through strongly. I would prefer to make a cup of Illy and pour it over ice, but the canned version is a convenient alternative. I would have rated it higher, but I found that it left a distinct aftertaste, not the pleasant aftertaste from a strong coffee, but more of a metallic taste from the can. I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.",0

"My cat is a picky eater, and loves his chicken. So Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken has been a huge hit with Hercules for the past year or so. That is, until the last two cases. I've been noticing that it looks a little grey, and not so much like freshly cooked chicken. Then I realized that I was throwing out about 1/3 to 1/4 of each serving, something that never happened before. Then I happened to compare an older can with one of the newer ones: Bingo! While the ingredients are the same, it looks like the amount of potato starch has been vastly increased. And the cat doesn't really like it as much.",0
"With my first bite into this candy, I noticed a touch of bitterness.  The bitter flavor diminished after that.  Unfortunately, this chocolate also has a waxy taste to it.  Very unappetizing!",0
The title says it all. It's a basic cup of coffee that you won't pass up at the water cooler. Good but not great.,0
"I haven't had a chance to call the company to ask about overseas product in this, but I will.<br />I like these because it's easy to cut them into small training size treats. If I can find out if it's all USA source ingredients I'll give these treats a 4.5.",0
"I obtained a sample and when I opened the package the aroma was not inviting at all.  Well, I brewed it up anyway on a regular Cuisinart coffee maker and used the sample bag with enough water for 2-3 cups to make a stronger cup of coffee. Nevertheless, it tasted weak to me and didn't smell any better after brewing it. It was drinkable and ok, just not very satisfying to me as it didn't have a richness or depth or good aroma to it. Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid. If you need a low acid coffee, then this is okay, but if not you may not find this satisfying, especially if you like dark, full flavored strong coffee.",0
2 of the 3 boxes had less than 12 Kcups! 1 box only had 7!! how does this happen??!?!?!?! Coffee tastes Good.,0
"I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.",0
"My dog is a finicky eater and in the stores when I bought the packets that come 4 flavors to a box, my dog loved the chicken and the turkey but none of the other flavors so buying just one box full of the flavor he liked seemed perfect. However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already. So after having a package or two of his favs, he got sicker and has gastritis terrible..  had to go to vet and is still recovering so won't be using the rest of the packages.<br /><br />Read full ingredients before giving anything to your little guy and be sure he's able to digest these products.<br /><br />Now I just buy ground turkey and ground chicken, or whole, cook it up myself and give it to my little guy making certain there is nothing in the food that can cause him severe illness.",0
"this package is actually much smaller than it looks. the stuff is okay but i gave it to few people for the holidays and when i paid them a visit and saw a little basket sitting on the table i thought what smuck gave this tinky thing to an entire office of 4 people. well..... i was that smuck hehe. anyways if you're planning to give it to 1 person maybe two go ahead, but don't try to please an office with it because there won't be enough to go around!",0
"I brought this to compare with 5-Hour energy. When comparing the labels i've realized this has only half of every ingredient then 5-hour energy, Such as Vitamin b6, 5-hour has 40mg so red rain has 20mg. I only drink half a bottle of 5-hr at a time so drinking 1 full bottle of red rain will be equal to 1/2 of 5hr. and obviously i'd have to drink 2 of the red rain to equal 1 5hr BUT it is still cheaper. FYI these are sold at K-Mart for $1 or if you buy the 2pk its $1.79 which comes out to $.90 a bottle! Just dont think i'd really want to drink 2 bottles to get the effect of 1 but i'll see how it goes, i've only drank 1 bottle thus far",0
"I'm one of those people who won't eat foods if they look suspicious or unappealing.  Guacamole -with the exception of a wonderful authentic Mexican restaurant in southern Delaware that my family takes me to on special occasions- is mostly really awful.  The sewer-looking and barely adequate taste and appearance of guacamole just doesn't get the job done as far as leaving me satisfied.  I'd rather not eat it and I certainly don't want more.  Unfortunately this type of guacamole dip mix falls under the category I mention above.  It's really bland and just makes your food taste worse.  It's a matter of personal preferece of course so you and your family might actually enjoy it.  Me?  Not so much.  If I *have* to eat guacamole I will, but otherwise I'd rather avoid it.",0
"One thing I found was that the coffee was ground way too fine. I use one of those filters that you can wash out. Ended up with a sludge in the bottom of the pot from grounds making their way through the filter. So, best to use a paper filter on this stuff.<br /><br />It does taste chocolate truffley. But, I am not a fan of the taste. Maybe someone else will like it, but I really do not care for it.",0
"I am new to being a cat-mom but not so new that I haven't figured out a cat will often/likely behave exactly the *opposite* of how you might expect. I guess my kitty is trying to tick-off the folks at Sojos by feigning complete indifference to their hand-harvested catnip product.<br /><br />I *swear* I heard this cat laughing at me from his litter box when he found out that I bought one organic brand here on Amazon for about $13 a pound, another package at just under $10 for three ounces, and then this tiny little can at what comes to well *over* a HUNDRED dollars a pound! And comes with special instructions to ration it out once or twice a week??? Yup, I'm pretty sure I was hearing mlol, mlol, mlol instead of meow, meow, meow.....<br /><br />Let him laugh - I'm okay with the trial and error thing - with a cat involved I'm actually getting VERY used to it, and being out eight bucks is not exactly going to ruin my day. Just I thought I would mention this lackluster experience with Sojos since this is the *only* brand that I purchased to state unequivocally in their product description that it induces a ""euphoric state"" and no such state was forthcoming. Unless this cat is REALLY good at faking sober.<br /><br />Maybe Sojos should go with a description more like ""your mileage may vary""?",0

"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Each can has 140 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 35g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C.

"I was disappointed by this pod. The coffee is weak.  No real zing to it.  If you like rich, full bodied coffee flavour in your coffee this is not for you.  The vanilla flavour in it is okay but just not enough coffee for me.  I'm sticking to my dark roast pods.",0
"A bold, but not a super bold blend.

"I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving.",0
I like the coffee but cannot see paying the price for it but the coffee is good and doesn't have any bitter after taste to it. I drink Emerils which taste good to me and I get the 50 pack for 30 dollars here. Sorry but cannot recommend buying Starbucks till they drop the price,0
"3-stars for the packaging. The crackers are, of course, excellent. Someone was on to something by putting these in snack size packages. However, usually when you eat something on the go you will eat a little now and a little later. What you need is resealable packaging. These ""fresh stack"" packs come in the regular old brown glued plastic wrap. You still have to provide the zip-lock bag yourself. At least these fit in a zip-lock bag easier than the full size stacks.",0
"I tried these cookies and my first impression was rather positive: it's soft, super-chocolate tasting and a nice indulgent snack. Then after just eating two I felt it was a bit much. The cookie really tasted almost too sweet to the point of making me feel rather sick after eating just a few. There was also an odd aftertaste that gave me the feeling that (obviously) there are probably more chemicals packed into this cookie than there are natural, good ingredients. In all, these cookies are just okay but could be improved upon.",0
"I love Fig Newtons and I love crisp cookies.  I really wanted to love these new cookies.<br />Kudos to Nabisco for trying to make a healthier type cookie that uses real fruit, flax, natural flavoring and sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.<br />We are slowly eating these as they aren't bad, but they also aren't the cookie or snack we want or crave.<br />As many others have noted they are a bit on the dry side.  They are visually appealing cookies and I actually like how thin they are.<br />Overall, they are just a bit to bland and dry for me.  Hopefully Nabisco will look at all the feedback on this and make some tweaks to the ""recipe"" and re-release these.",0
The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.<br />The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.,0
"That's not a compliment. Maxwell House isn't exactly top shelf. Personally, it's not as good as Donut Shop but it is 13 cents per cup less when you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I love the packaging where the bottom is a coffee filter and not a k cup. Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste. And while it tastes OK, there are tastier options out there.",0
"I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small. I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging.  But with the cut of the spices, you really only get about 1.5 T of spices.  Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I didn't notice before ordering. Had I seen that, I would have ordered a different mix from another company.",0
"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.",0
"The flavor of the chips are good, but the texture is a bit off.  They really douse the chips with Parmesan and herbs, but once you start chewing they start to taste really weird.

"the Bergamot used here smells and tastes like rancid Lychee nuts, so if you are just looking for a pleasant black tea, pick something else.  A tea at this price point should not be using ""flavoring"" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested.",0
"I bought a 4 pack of the Senseo Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro pods. They were pretty weak, and so could not make more than a 4 oz cup of coffee, which I actually stopped filling after 3 oz or so. It was ok, just very weak. Probably will not buy again.",0
"Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.",0

"These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger ""kick"" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it.",0
"This is a quality product, the soup base and veggies come in a freeze dried brick that you place on top of the noodles before adding about a cup of boiling water.  Its delightful to see this dry little brick burst into green onions, mushrooms and soup base.  It fills the top of the cup with lots of great stuff.  The flavor was delicate and nice.  Now the part that is a deal breaker for me is the noodles..  They are flavorless, colorless strings that clump together and are not so easy to swallow.  I found myself trying to really chew these because I didnt like the feeling of the long strands of noodles half in my mouth and hanging down my throat.  It was odd..  If you like Mai-fun (cellophane) noodles or you are wanting to try them this is for you..  I prefer wheat/flour based noodles..  But you may love this, and like I said its a quality item.",0
"I probably need to try other brands/types of white tea to compare,<br />but overall I've had green teas I consider to be much better relatively speaking<br />I've had green teas that I rate to be about as mediocre as this seems to be compared to better green teas<br /><br />I like the smell of this freshly brewed, and the taste at first but after a bit the taste seems to go sort of ""flat"" or something.<br />I also make batches of this and put it in the refrigerator as iced tea<br />it's the same, at first the smell and taste are pretty good, but it quickly loses the appealing aroma and the taste goes from better than decent to a little less than decent<br />I usually end up having to add sugar or lots of ice or watering it down or just drinking it fairly to drink more than a small cup of it at a time<br /><br />I still drink it because I haven't felt like trying other white teas yet<br /><br />overall it's drinkable, it's not horrible, but it's also not any special<br /><br />If I find other white teas that are better I'll drop the rating to a 2 but for now it seems like it's worth a star 3 rating",0
"I though that everything was fine as the first one I took out of the box matched the illustration exactly.  None of the others matched the illustration.  They do not say ""EXTRA BOLD"" on the cups at all, but the sticker on the box does actually say extra bold.<br />It's been a while since I tried one of these, so I wasn't sure if they just mislabeled them, decided they weren't ""extra bold"" to begin with, or they are jsut pranksters.  At any rate, I took off two stars because I suspect that they pulled a fast one at the factory.",0

"Our two terriers enjoy this food.  Their coat is shiny so the proper nourishment exists.  However, it causes terrible gas in our younger dog and will ""cause"" me to look for something else. Otherwise this is a good value for the price.",0
"I must have somehow ""missed"" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.",0
My 8-year-old Yorkie doesn't like it... he only eats when he is hungry.<br />I rate it as 3-star since my dog still eats it.,0
"I do love regular Illy coffees and their espresso, but this canned Cappuccino drink is a little blah. It doesn't have a very strong coffee flavor and its a little too sweet for my taste. Although its a refreshing alternative to hot coffee in warm weather, I doubt I'd buy this brand again.",0
"Overall a smooth taste. I have even used in making dessert. However, was hoping for a stronger flavor for my morning espresso.",0
"The product description for this bottled water makes various health claims: in addition to hydrating better than regular water, Essentia is supposed to boost the immune system, help maintain restful sleep and heart health, and so on. There are two justifications for these benefits: the increases electrolytes and the pH of 9.5.<br /><br />These health claims are the sort of thing that really need to be evaluated by scientific trials, not by individual experiences. But a bit of quick googling about ""alkaline water health benefits"" shows that the scientific literature is pretty thin. There seems to have been one study saying that alkaline water increases bone density, which is a good thing for people worrying about osteoporosis, and another study saying that it improved hydration. Meanwhile, various anecdotal sources say that it can reduce acid reflux, which seems particularly plausible just from a priori reasoning: if you're having problems with acid, you might be able to neutralize it by adding a base.<br /><br />I don't personally suffer from acid reflux, so I can't assess its effectiveness there, but if it's a problem that you do have, then it might be worth giving this water a try since you'll be able to see very quickly whether it works for you. The potential benefits against osteoporosis, on the other hand, are longer-term, so without seeing further scientific studies I wouldn't personally want to embark on a program of drinking expensive bottled water indefinitely, since it would be harder to judge whether it was actually working. The interest for me, then, was mainly in the improved hydration.<br /><br />I'm a casual runner, and I hate to carry water with me, so it's not uncommon for me to end up with a slight dehydration headache even after consuming water when I get home. That happened once this week already, when I went for a 5-mile run just after noon.<br /><br />I drank my 1.5 L sample of Essentia over two days (along with other fluids, of course). On the first day, I didn't run at all, but walked about four miles. On the second day, I went for two short runs, 1.8 miles each way to the bookstore and back in the middle of the afternoon. It was sunny out, so I felt pretty sweaty by the end of it. I drank Essentia before and after the run, though there wasn't much left by the end, and so I also drank about 750 mL of regular water as well.<br /><br />I didn't end up with a dehydration headache, and I also slept well that night, but there are too many other variables at play for me to attribute these good things purely to the Essentia. Maybe the difference from my previous run was the much shorter length, or the time of day, or just the overall quantity of water that I consumed afterwards, regardless of whether it was Essentia. While I'm intrigued with Essentia's claims, I'm not entirely convinced. I'd be willing to try drinking Essentia over a longer period of time if it were provided to me for free, but for the moment, the benefits aren't clear enough to me that I'm willing to purchase it in quantity for myself at more than $2/bottle. I'll await further studies.<br /><br />The one thing I can comment on with confidence is the taste, which seemed pretty average to me. There is something slightly different about it, but I find it hard to describe: it almost seemed reminiscent of carbonated water, except it's not carbonated at all. Anyway, the taste was fine, but I didn't find it unusually good; it was pretty clearly purified tap water (like Dasani), rather than spring water. The taste was better than Dasani, but not something that I'd pay extra for; I'm generally happy enough with the taste of tap water.<br /><br />So with an average taste and health benefits that could use some more research, this isn't something that I'm going to buy any time soon. Still, people with different health needs (particularly acid reflux) may find it helpful to them, and it will be interesting to see whether further research turns up any more relevant evidence.",0
"I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners. If it hits the floor, they eat it. I normally treat them to Stop & Shop brand treats in the assorted flavors (and colors) because they love them. The medium sized Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits have been spit out repeatedly by my two 55 pound dogs. I even broke them in two to make them smaller for my dogs' mouths and they still reject them. It seems to be not only the size, but the fact that these biscuits are extremely hard. I'm sure that is what helps remove tartar, but my dogs only like a tough chewing job when they are enjoying a rawhide bone.<br /><br />On the other hand, the LARGE variety go over better, but not so much as quick treats but as if my dogs think I've just given them a rawhide to gnaw on. They're just in for a surprise when, after enough chewing of these hard bones, they actually break apart and become edible.<br /><br />Some of the main ingredients include wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, poultry fat, poultry digest, sugar, dried whey, malted barley flour, dried cane molasses, citric acid, corn starch, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Aside from also having vitamins in the ingredients, these treats are loaded with ingredients that are hard to pronounce and sound like things you learned bout back in chemistry class!",0

"The taste very similar to the original vanilla, which I ordered just a little while ago. The do have that nice crunchy texture to start, but then end up gummy and sticks to your teeth. Not bad if you have a craving for them, but you will want to brush your teeth and floss after eating them and for some people they will hate the clingy fee. It's not really a problem for those who eat them by putting them in their mouth and letting them dissolve, more for those who munch on them.",0
"The makers of the water claim that Essentia is purified through reverse osmosis, is electrolyte infused, hydrates better and has a pH of 9.5.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I didn't think it was particularly smooth - I much prefer the taste of Fiji. I drank 1 glass a day for about a week and can't say I feel any miraculous results. I can get just as well hydrated with water from my Brita filter and not spend almost $30 bucks for 12 bottles of water...",0
"I usually drink spring water. This one taste like a tap water and I could only drink it when very chilled. The warmer it got the worse it tasted. It is basically tap water purified with added minerals.<br />Due to high ph number it taste very smooth, heavy and thick. It didin't feel refreshing to me at all. It's not the worse I've tried, it beats for instance Las Vegas tap water;)<br /><br />It will be good for someone who prefers this type of water. I don't so this is why only 2 stars.",0
"I prefer beef jerky and if this weren't on sale than I probably wouldnt have bought it (horray for amazon lightning deals) Anyways, the taste is fine, but you have to enjoy turkey.

I can eat an entire pack as a quick snack because there is not much in there..",0
"Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.  You can taste the blueberry, wine and chocolate characteristics, but this light roast coffee does not offer a ""first cup in the morning"" big caffeine boost.  Maybe if you are looking for a simple midday break you could brew a cup, but do not look for any pick me up qualities, this brew is designed for a pairing with a fruit based snack.

"Well, I have very mixed emotions (some practical; some pure speculation and some possibly unreasonable) about this particular product.  Please note that I have given these treats only three stars...this is over the objection of my dogs who absolutely love these things.<br /><br />I have four dogs and our family spends much time with them.  A lot of time is spent in training and we have found that ""treat food"" is a wonderful motivator; the more the dogs like the treat, the better they perform.<br /><br />Now there is no doubt that these are a desirable little jar of goodies as far as the taste of our particular dogs is concerned...there is not problem in this area.  I must admit though that I was negligent in doing my research on these things and simply did not read the labeling as I should have done.  Thanks to a couple of wonderful reviews here which brought to my attention that these little things are made in CHINA, I no longer use them.  Perhaps this is being overly cautious and perhaps being overly zealous is my private little hang-up about only buying American made products when ever possible, but so be it.<br /><br />While we have had no health problems with our dogs since using this product, it must be noted that there have been several instances (as noted by other reviewers) of tainted animal food coming out of China.  If you will note, there have also been quite a number of instances where tainted human baby products have been shipped and sold in this country which were also manufactured in china.  Now it would only seem logical to me that if a manufacturing firm or firms made, released and sold products that are harmful to humans, then even less thought would be given to products for ""animals.""  Perhaps I am wrong here, but it is never-the-less how I see it.<br /><br />Now are dogs are fed these things in very small amounts so  the possibility that they would be injured by a product that was actually tainted is slim, but still and all I am not willing to take this chance with the lives of our dogs who are, in all reality, members of our family.<br /><br />I am also absolutely sick and tired of spending my hard earned money on products that could be and should be manufactured here at home...good grief...this cannot be good for us as a country!<br /><br />To use these things is of course ultimately the decision of each individual.  This is my take on the situation as to the product, and as I said, we will not longer be using it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks",0
"These are quite tasty and filling to boot. I much prefer them over granola or cereal bars for a snack.  I don't think they should be called Newtons though, as that brings to mind a moist chewy treat and these are not.  Still, I would have given them a higher rating if they were even remotely good for you.  For the amount of calories and fat in these, I will usually choose to eat regular fruit Newtons.  In summary; these are tasty and a nice treat on occassion but not a healthy alternative to regular Newtons.",0
I ordered this coffee thinking it would be as tasty as other Baronet coffees but I was disappointed with the strength and taste.,0
"There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with...",0

"My puppy really likes these treats and they've been great with training, there are just two things I would mention that I didn't think about before purchasing: 1. These treats are big for a puppy so we cut each one in half 2. Since they are hard, our puppy has to stop our training to eat which can cause him to loose focus. If you're looking for training treats, I'd get a smaller and softer kind, but if your just looking for some yummy treats they seem work well.",0
"I recently purchased this product (not here but at walmart where it is $6 a box not $10) for a cake I was making for a friend.  I usually do cakes in butter cream and fondant but she wanted whipped icing.  Anyway,  I did a test batch a week before and it was really good.  The icing came out fluffy and stiff enough for icing and piping. It held up really well in the fridge for several days.  However the day of the cake it was a very hot day and not having air conditioning, my kitchen was very warm.  The icing completely collapsed despite several tries with several batches, freezing the bowl and mixer whisk, ice applied to the bowl, and extended whipping,  I could not get it to stiffen.  It was a soft, runny mess and did not make for nice icing.  I was unable to pipe with it at all. So if you purchase this just keep that in mind.  I still prefer buttercream but the taste is creamy and less sweet that buttercream if that is what you prefer.",0
"I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product.",0
"I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.",0
"I've tried several kinds of fruit and nut bars, and these are my least favorite.

Very tasty!<br /><br />However, this product contains inulin, a poly-fructose that is not digestible, at least not by humans.  Turns out, bacteria in the colon love inulin.  They metabolize it like crazy, creating lots of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane in the process.  Needless to say, after eating a few of these cookies, you may have to tie the blankets down on your bed to keep them from being blown off.  But if you're the sort who is amused by digestive music, these cookies might become a favored treat.",0

"First, let me say that I'm new to drinking tea.  I decided to purchase this tea in order to sample the different types of tea that Ahmad offered.

I thought this was common until my sampler pack from Two Leaves and a Bud came in - Two Leaves and a Bud has no bitter after taste and is very smooth.  Now, I drink the Ahmad teas if I don't have any Two Leaves tea remaining.  This is decent tea but not compared with the higher quality teas out there.",0

"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",0

"I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.",0
"Annie Chun's Soba Japanese Noodles, 12oz. These noodles were just ok for me. I much prefer the texture of Hakubaku organic soba noodles. I think its their size as they cook up differently.

"I bought this at Whole Foods (which is why my purchase isn't verified).  I got on Amazon to check the reviews to see if I was the only one that thought this tastes a little strange.  Not necessarily bad, just different.  (Let me add that I eat mostly organic and I am used to the difference between organic food and artificially flavored crud).  I get a hint of lavender or rosemary at the beginning, and then the pudding ends off on a sweet note.  I put a little vanilla and cinnamon in mine and that helped improve the flavor.  I think fresh bananas would also be nice.  I'll gladly put up with the strange taste knowing this isn't full of genetically modified soy and garbage preservatives. It does contain soy lecithin, but the box indicates that there are no GMO's so I am okay with the soy lecithin.  I have the coconut up in my cupboard, can't wait to try it next!  Also, if I could give this 3.5 stars instead of 3, I would.",0
"To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.",0
"My cat George never quite finishes a 6-ounce can of cat food, so I thought I would try these 3-ounce servings. However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far - the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!",0

"In an effort to reverse augmenting high blood pressure, a physician recommended I drink hibiscus herbal tea. Kudos to Celebration Herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed. I followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was  steeped for approximately ten minutes. Although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal, I also wanted a flavorable tea. Sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional. Accordingly, the next box of hibiscus tea that I purchase will not be from Celebration Herbals.",0
"It terms of being a healthy snack these cranberry flax oatmeal squares are great. Each bar has 6g of fiber, 13g of whole grain, no trans fat, 6g of protein, low sodium, all natural and packed with a bunch of vitamins. Plus it says on the package it's proven to help lower cholesterol. But there's one problem - it doesn't taste too good. It tastes like health food. It's like eating chewy and nutritious cardboard. I didn't really like it and probably won't be buying them again.",0
"i had never used Melitta coffee before, so when this arrived, we were anxious to taste it and see. We generally enjoyed the flavor, but it was definitely not as good as other coffees we enjoy.",0
I have to be very careful to use just a little of this tea when brewing because it's quite spicy.  I prefer a milder chai but appreciate the fact that it's rooibus and caffeine free.  Also wish it had star anise which I think gives chai a great taste.,0

"I had twin girls born at 33 weeks.  They got a combo of NeoSure and pumped breastmilk during their 19 day NICU stay.  When they came home, I attempted exclusively breastfeeding and while my girls gained weight, it was less than stellar and the pediatrician told me to start supplementing.  Their weight gain has been fantastic and seem to be on par developmentally and size wise with their cousin that was born 4 weeks later at full term.  But it's very hard on their little tummies.  They both spit up pretty much after every bottle and one girl is on Prevacid for her reflux.  They're still gaining weight well though, even with all of the spit ups.  My pediatrician wants them on this until they're 4 months old and I'm counting the days till I can switch formula to cut back on all the spit ups!",0
This popcorn is easy to burn if you don't get the timing exact.  If too little time by a couple of seconds you end up with a much smaller amount popped.  There is also not enough flavor for me.  I won't buy this again.,0
Order arrived much sooner than expected. Cans along the outside edge were pretty banged up but still usable. Overall a good product.,0
These candies were not as small as I have previously bought...but not from this vendor.  I will use as gifts but will not order again.  Vendor service was excellent.,0
"I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast.",0
"To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.",0
The last 3 months of Crispy n White have the same exp dates and are not poping as well. Evidensed by leaving more unpopped kernals in the bag.,0
Taste wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Item was a bit over priced. Definitely won't re-purchase.,0
"I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.",0
"I'm a great 'jet fuel' coffee person. So I figured I'd give ""Jet Fuel"" a try in my Keurig. My favorites are still Emeril's Big Bold and Timothy's Rain Forest Espresso. Unfortunately ""Jet Fuel"" is not as bold and full bodied and leaves a thin aftertaste that is not pleasant to my taste. Definitely will not be on my re-order list.",0
"To be honest, I was not expecting much. What can 1.62 ounces of tea really do? I expected to get about 4 or 5 teas, and not much else, despite the claim to many servings. However, this is a nice product and might be better for others.<br /><br />1. The taste reminds me too much of a hospital, maybe its just the peach flavor, but it reminded me of it (and I wasn't alone with this opinion)<br />2. You really can get a lot of servings out of it. The measure is very unscientific (they define a servings as a ""squirt"", which as you might guess varies quite a bit. A strong squirt? A quick squirt? A you-hold-for-a-second squirt? Who knows, but it falls somewhere in between. In general a strong squirt can give a bit of flavor to a 12 ounce glass of water.<br />3. Its convenient as it mixes very easy with water. If you are not picky, you don't even have to stir it. For a consistent taste, you can just stif for 2 seconds. If you want it sweeter, just keep adding squirts, (3 squirts on a 12 ounce glass makes for a very sweet tea, I wouldn't recommend more than that)<br /><br />Another positive in my book is the use of alcohol based/type sugars, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />However, at around $5 dollars per 1.6 ounce jar, it's quite expensive. I would say you get 20 decent size servings out of it, that comes out to 25 cents per strong squirt. Maybe the convenience is worth it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the hospital taste, I'd give it 4 stars.",0
"I am not an energy drink drinker nor am I addicted to caffeine.  The reason why I chose the Celsius drinks to review is that I feel as though I am all out of energy by around 3PM that I begin to doze off.  The added benefit of boosting my metabolism rate was also appealing.  I drinks I chose to review were the Celsius Peach Mango and the Raspberry Acai.<br /><br />Taste-wise it is so-so.  I have been drinking v8 vFusion Raspberry Acai flavor and have enjoyed the taste a lot.  I was hoping that this would taste somewhat similar, but was a bit disappointed.  I wasn't able to differentiate between the tastes of raspberry, acai, but was able to identify the green tea.  The taste which were decent.  However, I wasn't all that fond of the after-taste, which I was able to taste after each sip.  I don't like the taste of ginger, but could not taste it in this drink.<br /><br />Energy-wise, I did find that I felt a bit more energized, and was able to make it through the rest of the day without feeling sleepy.  I didn't experience any crashes.<br /><br />As this drink supposedly increases the metabolism rate, I weighed myself before drinking it and after.  I switched off between this Peach Mango flavor and the Raspberry Acai every day.  Without significantly changing my diet or exercise pattern, I did not notice any changes in weight.<br /><br />For the energy-boost alone, I would consider this drink a decent performer.  I would not purchase this for the taste or the claims of increase in metabolism rate.",0
"Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.",0
"The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!",0
"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.  It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it.  Get with it, Terra!",0
"So after reading all the reviews here we were excited to try another Nylabone for our Rottie who, putting it mildly, is a super aggressive chewer. He either has had or currently owns all of the largest Nylabones the company has to offer and we were happy to see the size of this one compared to his other large bones. Unfortunately the honeymoon didn't last long because within the first few hours of ownership he chewed off 1/4 of the green middle part. He starts with the nubs and gradually works his way onto larger chunks. He is always supervised with new toys and lucky for us he isn't a swallower of large chunks, although I'm sure we will find our fair share of green nubs in the yard tomorrow morning after his usual morning business - a nice little St. Paddy's day treat for us all! Oh yeah, it does smell pretty good overall as the mint hides some of the usual slobber stench so that's a plus as well.",0
It does not look like the picture and in my case it died very quickly. I gave up on bonsai after that.,0
"I was very disappointed by the flavor of these Kit Kats which completely lacked any chocolateyness in the way I'm use to from Kit Kats.<br /><br />After some searching around on the web I found that Kit Kats in the States are made by Hershey rather than Nestl&eacute; and although Hershey license the exact same recipe from Nestl&eacute; to make their Kit Kats the vital 'Chocolate' itself comes from a different recipe; the so called 'Hershey Chocolate' flavor.<br /><br />Sadly this 'Hershey Chocolate' flavor is just that. Compare it to a Nestl&eacute; made Kit Kats and the difference is staggering. Nestl&eacute; Kit Kats actually taste like chocolate and not a mere sweet, slightly grainy paste.<br /><br />When a say 'tastes' like Chocolate. You may argue that the taste of Chocolate is what you grew up on. If you grew up on Hershey Chocolate you'd say that was the taste of Chocolate and the Nestl&eacute; chocolate was something else. I would disagree though... having tasted 60% to 80% real chocolate I can say the Nestl&eacute; Kit Kat's taste is much closer to this real chocolate bar.<br /><br />Indeed in Canada you can actually buy Kit Kat Dark which have a higher Cocoa content. Quite delicious; and I find myself more restrained in eating them because of the stronger flavour which is a good thing!<br /><br />So if you're a Canadian (or from anywhere else where you are use to the original Nestl&eacute; Kit Kat) looking to save a few bob by buying your Kit Kats in bulk from the States... be warned!",0
"The product gets 5 stars.... Great taste, less fat, easy to throw into smoothies, turn into peanut dressing, for thai food or satay like dishes.<br /><br />Amazon pricing gets 1 star.

"This dog food has quality ingredients, but it gives my dog serious gas, for along time. Also, you're supposed to add the water and let it hydrate overnight, which I didn't expect to have to mess with. I'll be looking for something abit different from this in the future.",0
"It's the standard Horizon milk, in small packages that you don't have to refrigerate.<br /><br />The only reason I buy this is I bake, and I hate being halfway through a recipe and discovering I'm out of milk. With these packages, I throw it in the back of the cupboard, and it's there when I need it. Obviously, I use fresh when I have it!<br /><br />I suppose the main market for this is kid's lunches, where you don't want to worry about spoilage. It would be fine for that, although it's about the most expensive way to buy milk (and the price of for this today is twice what I paid, and is currently twice that from other sellers on Amazon, so check around!)<br /><br />They also show reduced fat milk, but shipped me the low-fat.",0
"I enjoy the nut/coconut content of this KIND bar, but do not like the calorie content.  It is very crunchy and I worry about it harming my dental work.",0
"When presented with this food, my dog picked out the meat pieces leaving behind the rest. She sometimes leaves the vegetable pieces laying around the house and I have to pick them up. I throw them away because she refuses to eat them. She only continues to make a mess with them. This is not a dog food I would purchase on a regular basis for my dog. However, I gave it 3 stars because she is a picky eater to begin with, and the fact that she ate some of it was good. She will not even touch Science Diet. I even tried mixing Science Diet with other dog foods and she would spit the Science Diet pieces out. Also, a former dog of mine ate Chef Michael's on a regular basis but not this flavor. She liked chicken and filet minion. I would suggest those flavors over this one.",0
Our cat doesnt care for this one as much as he did the last type of catnip spray we bought. Its really watery and alot of spray comes out using the botttle up quickly.,0
"Here's the short review: It has a decent scent, more manly than the creamy, sweeter smell of regular Dove body wash. If you're looking for body wash to maybe give you a bit more moisturizing effect, then this is a decent choice.<br /><br />But I think I still prefer a good old bar of deodorant soap. It's simpler and, well, cleaner. It doesn't leave a slippery feel on the tub floor like most body washes do. And most deodorant soaps give a fresher smell and wash off more thoroughly.<br /><br />I'll keep using it for a while and see if it gets better than this, otherwise I'll just stick with a mediocre 3 star rating.",0
"This is a dense and hearty cereal packing enough in it for those who prefer a hearty breakfast cereal over lighter fare.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the texture of this cereal, however. It is nothing like shredded wheat, which is what I imagined looking at the cereal. It's a somewhat indescribable combination of biscuit and dried oatmeal that's neither really crunchy nor soggy. It isn't too bad for a few days, but it isn't what I would buy regularly. I would recommend trying a box before splurging and getting a 4 pack.",0
I found the coffee to be a little to strong for my taste. Many times I had to let the pod<br />go a second time to get the coffee I like,0
"This is an OK drink to have in the fridge, high cute value but I was not overly impressed with the taste. I've never been to this restaurant chain, and perhaps it is better off the tap at these ""Dog n Suds"" restaurants or something. I doubt I'll buy this brand again unless I happen to have some other business in Indiana and occasion thereby to imbibe at such a franchise.<br /><br />Note this root beer is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, and contains sodium benzoate as a preservative. There is no  statements as to the herbs and spices in it, and none particularly standing out to me on the palate. It's mainly a strong vanilla taste, it's almost as much like a cream soda to me as a root beer, really. The mouth feel seems somewhat better and smoother than run of the mill brands like Mug or Hires, but I seriously question if it justifies this Amazon price which is over $2 per 12 oz. bottle presently.",0
"The cereal squares were tasty, and stayed crunchy in milk. They had good texture. I took 2 stars off because the name gave me the impression that it was a healthy breakfast choice. I'm in the market for heathier choices, with less sugar due to the fact I'm a Type 2 diabetic. One bowl drove my blood sugar to almost 200!  Please read the ingredient label before you buy!",0

"This flavor is my second favorite flavor Orgain shake (chocolate is the best!).  But beware if buying from sellers other than Amazon - make sure to check the expiration date when you receive the shakes.  I received a carton that expired within a month of my order date (maybe not a big deal for some, but it takes me at least a couple months to finish a carton of these).",0
"This is a rather expensive dog food for those of us who have XXL dogs. It doesn't come in 20-40 pound bags, so buying 4.5 pounds for that will last maybe four days isn't cost effective. I decided to try this via the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />First I will say my dog loved it. She snarfed it right down and then looked at me like ""Mom, MORE MORE MORE."" However, the dog food itself is heavy on soy, animal fat and corn products. Will I buy it again? Yes! However, that said, I do generally feed my dogs a high quality expensive kibble with some raw food thrown in. I will use Chef Michael's in a mixture of the high quality/expensive kibble and the raw. Due to the smaller sized bags and the high soy and corn content, I would not feed this as the only kibble.<br /><br />My dog, however, would love for this to be her only food!",0

"I am a diabetic but without a customery ''sweet tooth'', but need my black decaf SWEET and other non sugar things sweetened.  This is so overpoweringly VANILLA that I can't even use in my coffee and it doesn't even sweeten it enough which is the real purpose for which I bought it.  Just beware.  I couldn't FIND any PLAIN unflavored version of this so picked my favorite flavor, vanilla but too overwhelming.  Was looking for Truvia but saw some negative reviews so tried this meanwhile.  Tasted Stevia over a decade ago and hated it, but wanted to try Truvia to see if it's improved yet and haven't.  I use Sweet & Low tablets and liquid. Dr. Richard Bernstein the diabetic guru, says NEVER use the little envelopes of ANY brand sweetner EXCEPT Stevia, nor powdered 'envelopes' of ANY product which are filled with additives for shelflife that liquids nor tablets have. Just a tip. And I believe EVERYTHING Bernstein says, as I always have about Atkins since a kid, but now the company changed and became more commercial.  Using sweetners all my life with a Diabetic mother... and this is many decades later so sweetners have always been a staple in my life since a child thanks to her.  Those are my credentials lol",0
"this was ok but I didn't really care for it personnally. It dissolved easily and had a good mild lemon flavor. I didn't really taste the ginger. It isn't something I would pay money for to have again, maybe if the lemon flavor was stronger but it's more of a hint of lemon taste and I do love lemon flavor. Others may like it more, everyone has their own tastes, this is just how it seemed for me and I am a daily hot tea drinker, all flavors. I thought this would taste more like that but in a tea bag you can steep it for more flavor. This has quite a bit in each little package for one serving so it would be very expensive to use more and like all crystals, they aren't evenly blended in the package so you won't get the same flavor everytime if you need to add extra.",0
"These chews are not the same as the ones I get from the vet. Virbac adheres to strict quality control where all the chews are supposed to be the same thickness. I don't know if Amazon gets all the leftovers but the chews in these bags are all different thicknesses. Some are regular size and some are extremely thick. This is a concern for me as my dog had over $2,000 worth of dental work done and I don't want him chewing on anything too thick. These bags are cheaper than the ones I get from the vet and it shows.",0
"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.",0
This product itself is 5 star. I ordered the 6 pack. I have less than 3 months before all six bottles expire! IF I had found this in a grocery store I would have had 6 months to a year before they expired. My Conclusion is Amazon is selling old stock. Old books or electronics is fine; but old food is not!,0
I've been using Lean Body Shakes for a while now.  They've always tasted great but this last shipment tasted chalky and was quite difficult to drink.  I'm not sure if they changed the formula or if I got a bad batch but its enough to make me cancel my subscription to my monthly purchase and go another route.  I'm very disappointed.,0
"I wanted to try this juice as I'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a ""splash of pineapple"", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.<br /><br />On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste.",0
"I've dabbled with supplements for a while; this one tastes similar to the fruit punch flavor usually found in them, which for me isn't that great a taste. The caffeine boost with the vitamin content was appreciated though, and I like the concept: a quick squeeze in a cup of water in the morning to get you going. All in all, another flavor would be better for me, perhaps the grape pomegranate.",0
"Higgins and Burke is a new-to-me brand of tea. The packaging is very attractive, and there are twenty individually wrapped teabags inside the box I received. English Breakfast is usually my first tea of choice, but I do prefer it stronger than what I got here. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad at all, but neither was it overwhelmingly good. Just not enough flavor for my preferences.",0
I was really excited about this tea but I think I fell for the attractive box. It just doesn't do much for me. It's not the worst thing I've had but it's not that great either. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe try Tulsi or Yogi tea instead.,0
"I prefer roasted almonds with salt, but this product comes with a coat of dark chocolate.

"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.",0

"I bought this thinking it was a strawberry/banana version of the small Crystal Light on the go packets with 10 calories per packet.  I was a bit disappointed when I got them and they have 30 calories and 3x as much powder as the normal CL on the go packets.  If you are using a new bottle of water, you have to pour some water out to make room for the mix.  It also took about an hour for the powder to dissolve in the water.  It settled at the bottom of my bottle and would not mix no matter how hard I shook it.  I found that if you pour it in and place the bottle in the fridge for about an hour then go back to it, the water will have penetrated these clumps enough to mix in with some heavy shaking.  It is nearly impossible to mix in initially.  This is not a big deal for me, I will just place it mixed in my fridge overnight, but for anyone thinking they can just take a packet to work with them and mix it in at lunch will be disappointed, you will need a separate glass and spoon to mix immediately as you poor it into the water.  Now for the taste...It has a decent flavor when you first take a drink, but the after taste is not good.  I'll stick with my orange or raspberry lemonade CL on the go packs.",0

Yorkie #2 didn't pause once she got her broccoli with the powder.<br /><br />Next, I offered two identically sized broccoli pieces one dusted with the powder and one without powder.  Yorkie #1 ate the coated one first.  Yorkie #2 went for the uncoated piece first.  Considering that they are a bit picky but absolutely love fruits and vegetables, if they didn't want to eat this food, I believe both would leave the coated piece behind.<br /><br />I do believe that this is not ""candy"" but has some appeal.<br /><br />However, that said, it doesn't coat even wet vegetables well.<br /><br />I would consider buying the drops for regular use but I would definitely need to observe a noticeable improvement in their well being to justify the cost.",0
"I didn't care for them, I had never had them before so I can't really comment on quality or anything. The price was high. I was hoping I would like them but didn't too sugary for me.",0
"I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box.  If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.",0
"I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM"">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.",0
"I bought this because I am a vegan and I was feeling like I could use some extra protein in my diet. I already eat a lot of soy-based products, so I wanted something different to get my protein.<br /><br />The hemp smells and tastes a bit grassy, which isn't a problem for me, but some people might not like it. It is really easy to add to any drinks or food, but it doesn't dissolve like other protein powders do. In drinks, the granules tend to fall back down to the bottom after stirring. Also, they recommend keeping it in the fridge, which is a bit less convenient than something you keep in the cupboard.<br /><br />I like it, but because it doesn't dissolve, I probably won't rebuy once I've finished.",0
"The throat coat tea worked wonders for my seasonal congestion! The taste was a little off-putting, but it wasn't horrible.<br /><br />I was hoping to add this to my morning breakfast menu, but I noticed that I developed a rash of fine raised bumps on my neck after drinking this tea for three days. After reading the ingredients of the tea, the only ingredient that I've never used before is the slippery elm bark. Web MD states that slippery elm bark can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation, so this ingredient is the cause. I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't take a genius to make the connection here. I've stopped using the tea, and my rash has magically disappeared.<br /><br />Judging by all the five star reviews on this product, it's obvious that it works for a lot of people, but first time users of this product should be cautious when buying it for the first time.",0
"The cranberries kind of ruin it.<br /><br />Don't buy this cereal if you're not ready to give your teeth a real workout.<br /><br />Honestly, I could have done without the cranberries as the cereal itself tastes great with a mild sweetness and just the _slightest_ hint of a sweet ginger flavor.  Delicious. Stays crunchy in milk, like other Nature's Path cereals -- don't know how they do it -- and otherwise has a good mix of textures.<br /><br />It's just that you always have to be on guard for those cranberries lest you bite down onto a spoonful of them without paying attention.  As others have commented, the milk does not re-hydrate it (though I did consider microwaving it to see if that would help).<br /><br />Fix the cranberry issue -- or just take them out completely -- and it's a 5 star cereal!",0
"This is a LOT of soup for one and who wants to/can ""save"" some? It's blander than the other instant pea soup I've had, but not bad. I won't<br />order it again, but that's just me.....I like this brand of instant oatmeal, but it is also TOO big for one serving! Enough already!! Not<br />everything has to be ""supersized""!",0
"This tea should be more accurately called ""Tahitian Ginger Ginger"" tea.<br /><br />It tastes like ginger and cinnamon and....that's it. No hazelnut or vanilla that I could detect. If (like me) you are really not a fan of ginger you will be disappointed. In my case, after choking down the first cup, I had resolved that I must throw the rest of the box away because it was just way too spicy and gingery for me. Very unpleasant.<br /><br />However, I decided to give it another try. I steeped the tea only briefly, less than 30 seconds, as opposed to 3-4 minutes, and I added two splashes of milk (instead of my usual one) and also, I added a little more stevia than usual. Anyway, the result was... a nice cup of tea that I enjoyed. I've had the tea a few more times in this same way and I actually do like it now and might even consider buying it again. Still the advertising for this tea is so strange (the main flavors are not in the title), and the tea is so strong and harsh that I feel the need to warn others. If you do try it, and dislike it like I do, steeping it for less time will go a long way....",0
"I love this product normally, but it tasted just a little bit rancid - the expiration date was OK but maybe it was stored improperly. Still edible but a little concerning.",0
"The peanut butter is easy to mix together and spread on bread.  However, the taste is only ok.  I'll use what I have but would not order more.",0
"I was disappointed when I drank my first k cup ice tea.  I love iced tea, however I do not like lemon in my tea at all - I just want the taste of the tea leaves.  The Celestial English Breakfast Black Tea has a lemon flavoring added.  Ugh ... I was really hopeful I could brew a glass of ice tea with my Keurig.  It is not bad tasting at all - it is just not what I prefer.",0
"I've tried this product on it's own in a bread machine and it didn't rise.  Then I've tried it with a mix of other flours and the bread rises alittle but not like what I get with king arthur bread flour. All my ingredients are fresh and work with the store brand ""bread flour"" so if someone knows a secret to this, please let me know. I rated this 3 stars because ""It's Ok"" and probably good for someone making bread by hand. I'm using a Westbend Hi-Rise. I have 3 bags left and would like to use it so feel free to email me or leave a comment. Maybe there is a simple adjustment but I don't want to waste anymore ingredients on bad loaves.",0
"I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it. I want my base coffee to be an experience in itself and something that I look forward too.<br /><br />Martinson Dark Roast K-cup does not give me that coffee experience. Although the coffee is smooth, I will give it that, it is bland and kinda tastes like instant.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't spend the money I did on a Keurig machine to get a cup of instant coffee. I can do that with a pot of boiling water and a cheap jar of whatever.<br /><br />While I do not expect the same experience as I get when I grind my beans fresh and brew it in my french press, I do expect a reasonably fresh ground taste.<br /><br />On a positive note the presentation of the K-cups and the box are top notch. The black/gray combination makes the coffee look like it is presented in a tuxedo. 5 stars for the marketing department on this one as the look on the shelf is bound to grab lots of attention so that people will buy it at least once.",0
"The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol",0
"***Original Review***<br />I bought these to try out.  When I got them, the smoke flavor was a little intense, so I only ate 1 stick a day or so.<br /><br />After a while, they grew on me and I found myself eating 2 or 3 a day.<br /><br />I'm ordering more, which shows how much I've grown to like them.<br /><br />**** Revised review ****<br />My last order was dry and very salty.  When I originally ordered these links, they were shipped from a third party or the manufacturer, but the last one I ordered came from Amazon.<br /><br />Is it possible that the stocks have sat around and dried out a bit?  I don't know, but I do know these were not as good as they used to be, hence dropping the number of stars down to 3.",0
"I love seaweed and have tried many brands, but was new to this one.  This product is ok, but it has it's issues.  First, the flavor is ok, but the texture is so brittle it just crumbles as you try to take it out of the package.  Second the size is inconvenient.  Each sheet is about 7x8"", not a good size for eating.  Not really good for holding as it's too large and just keeps crumbling making quite a mess.  I think a child could only get a few bites before the rest was on the floor.  The pkg comes w/5 sheets, so if you use only one or 2, the others will go stale really quickly.  The serving size is 1/2 a package and that's a good sized serving, with only 24 calories.  However, 22 of those calories are fat.  Interesting how different seaweeds have such different calorie, fat and carb counts.  Go figure.  I think the price is also a little high, but I don't know if that's the retail price or the Amazon price.  Overall the product is ok, but you can do better.",0
"I like the other jerky products I have tried from Golden Valley very much, but the Sweet N' Spicy Buffalo Jerky is a bit too hot for my taste.  I thought ""sweet and spicy"" meant medium hot since it wasn't called ""Sweet and hot"".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!",0
"Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter - more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website.",0
"This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.",0
"Ordered this product because I wanted a cup of instant with real coffee taste and it does make a full bodied cup of coffee, the rub comes over two issues.<br /><br />First is the cost, about a dollar a cup, sorry a little to rich for this retired person. Second each packet contains 60 calories worth of sugar. That means only one packet per day on my diet.<br /><br />Starbucks please make an unsweetened version and the price lets just say, I guess I'll have to find another brand.",0
"I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.",0
"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.",0
"The probiotics helps my baby's gassiness. However, my 8 month old likes her food thick. No matter how much rice cereal I added, the food practically digests itself (very quickly at that too) before my baby even has a couple spoons of it. Don't understand why it has to contain amylase enzyme. I have let it stand and literally watch it thins itself out, without my baby ever touching the food. I typically added a couple ounces of homemade organic vege with an ounce of breastmilk plus the Earth Best oat and rice together with Happy Bellies, hoping to keep it thick a little longer, but to no avail. I am writing this review because I just threw out another bowl of food because my baby refuses to eat it after a couple spoons since it literally just became soup despite I made it *thick*.",0
I don't know if it does what it claims; the taste is not bad but it does take getting used to it.,0
"I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.",0
"Little bit of a burnt taste after nuking, every one of them.  Decent taste, fairly healthy.  Not the cheapest.",0

"Well, it's as advertised, tabasco flavored double sized slim jim.<br /><br />It's just not as great as some of the other flavors like sweet/hot, nacho, and so on. It's not even really that hot. They captured 80% of the flavor of tabasco, and none of the heat.",0
my kids love these but I paid $22.24 for 24 bags on Amazon.  I just came back from Costco where I only paid $12.99 for 20 bags! A whole lot cheaper at costco!!!,0
I have been sampling a few k-cups and this is nothing special. I purchased this cheap in amazon warehouse deals.  Its decaf but has nothing special to it.  Id much rather have the Timothy's Colombian decaf but that can get pricy fast.<br />This is ok but more of a last resort. I do add some hot coco mix to it to fix it up.,0
HATE HATE HATE the gooey mess I was just sent from Amazon.  It looked like it melted then firmed up a bit. It was a brown sticky block. Tasted great but it still looked disgusting.,0
"I've been using this for some time, and no, I'm not enjoying the benefits or suffering the side effects as I write this review.<br /><br />What you need to know is that this product doesn't really give you any extra energy. All it does is tell your body to put the pedal to the metal and use up all the energy that it has budgeted for the day. This is why you end up feeling dead about 4-5 hours after consumption; NEVER drink this to wake up in the morning as the commercials suggest.<br /><br />With that said, if you're about to take a midterm or it's late in the afternoon and you need a boost, this will definitely give you an edge.<br /><br />Also works well as a sleep aid.",0
"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",0

"Being that I am a diabetic, I love Crystal Light, usually. This mocktail of Margarita was the lone exception. The first thing that hit me upon tearing open the packet and pouring it into my pitcher was the raunchy aroma. Usually the Crystal Light smell is either pleasant or non existing. This Margarita mix smelled horrible. I went ahead and added water and shook vigorously to blend the mix well. I then tasted the concoction: not bad. It does have a nice sweetened lemonade flavor. It does not taste like a cocktail at all though. It does not taste, to me, like a virgin Margarita even, just a blandish, sweet lemonade type of flavor. Then came the gastric distress. Oh no! I drink Crystal Light every day with no ill effects; this concoction, once again, was the sole exception. I'll spare the details, but suffice to say that I am not willing to even test this mocktail again. I am back to my trusty Raspberry, Peach, or Lemon Ice Tea blend. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, but with this stuff there was a small loss to the venture.<br /><br />That's my experience, maybe yours might be better,<br />MLC",0
"Too sweet, too grainy and too soft. It's like another reviewer said, they taste like the caramel squares only with licorice instead. Definitely NOT Callard and Bowser quality, although the licorice flavor ain't bad.",0
"I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.",0
"I buy this in the large tin to cook with. If you are looking for oil to dip bread, use as a special flavor, etc.- you can find an oil to suit your taste. Yet, this is good oil. Frankly, I like Il Fornaio from the restuarant in the  NYNY casino/hotel in Vegas better. But, this oil is priced right for every day use. It is also great for salads and adding your own spices to. Get the 3L tin, and; you should be set for a bit.",0
"My dog sometimes eats this and sometimes walks away. What can I say...looks good to me, but hes the dog.",0
"I really wanted to like these. I bought the double pack so I would have one for home and one for school. The school used traditional food dyes and my daughter broke out in hives. Not good. But we just tried to make playdough with these colors and were unable to make blue or green or yellow. Shades of reddish-pink to purply colors were ok. Perhaps it would help if I used bleached flour . As is, I can only endorse this half-heartedly for those who aren't trying to achieve a very specific color. It's a lot of money to spend for a product that only works moderately. I wish I had just experimented with juices instead (spinach, beet, and carrot) as someone else had recommended. I still would pick these over standard food dyes since those are linked to causing cancer and no amount of fun with food dye is worth that!",0
"My cats do not like it. But I know other cats that are eager for a piece. It is all a matter of taste. However, the vet told me they are the best for teeth tartar removal and I would recommend them to a cat that has teeth problems. Nevertheless, I heard it caused cat choaks in the past (probably because the cats did not chew the pieces), so be cautious when offering them to your animal.",0
"...but I guess a little more like a tortilla chip.  I found these tasty and satisying, not quite as salty as the grocery store type tortilla and corn chips (a plus for me).  I didn't taste anything that hinted of olives, though.  Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!",0
"I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but my doctor suggested this product to help in treating my recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.  I tried it in coffee, but 1 packet is too much as it left an aftertaste on the tongue. (I don't ordinarily sweeten my coffee}  Tried it in a powdered drink mix that makes artificially flavored red water.  I used the number of packets suggested by the Truvia web site (...) as a substitute for 1 cup of sugar.  To my taste, it was properly sweetened and did not leave the aftertaste that I detected with the coffee.<br />Will try some of the suggestions from the Truvia web site and report later.",0
"I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it.",0
"I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.",0
"I got this flavored coffee to supplement our regular favorite, Donut Shop Coffee. It's a light roast, so it lacks the boldness that we look for in a morning cup of coffee. But the aroma truly lives up to its name. It smells great while brewing and has a more than subtle chocolate flavor to it. Would I order it again, probably, but only as a novelty coffee, never as a mainstay.",0

"I had high hopes for these cookies because I adore Oreos and I love other Late July products (my favorite is the mini-peanut butter crackers).  I was disappointed, however.  These cookies taste stale and greasy to me.  They are way less sweet and less flavorfull than Oreos.<br /><br />So I took them to work to get rid of them, and coworkers went wild.  They were gone quickly, and I know some of them plan to buy these regularly now.<br /><br />Each cookie has 55 calories, by the way.<br /><br />I recommend trying to find them at your local grocery store before buying them in bulk on Amazon.  Here in Minneosta, Cub Foods sells them in a 9 oz box for a few dollars.",0
These would be good to use in something that you were baking but to eat them alone they are not good.  A little too overwhelming on the spice flavor.,0

Serves two very generously and definitely three, maybe four, with smaller appetites or extra sides.<br /><br />Did I mention tasty?  Just do not expect collard soup with lots of collards.",0

"Normally, I use 5hr energy (extra strength), when I need a boost of energy, but since 5hr has a higher price tag, I thought I'd try Red Rain.  I read reviews that said it's just as good, and the fact that it's 1/2 the price was why I decided to give it a try.  The price is good...but the potency is just so-so.  Red Rain also has a much milder taste, (I happen to like the taste of 5hr, so Red Rain tasted a little flat to me).<br /><br />It's been my experience that these energy shots affect people differently, so I would recommend giving it a try, because it may work better for you than it did for me.<br /><br />But, overall, I wasn't impressed enough to make the switch to Red Rain.  Personally, Red Rain just wasn't potent enough for my needs.  (I am a SAHM with 3 kids...so I often need BIG energy boosts to keep up with them!)",0
"I suppose if you have been gluten free for a long time this bread is great, but it has a slightly sweet taste (some may like that) and its much like other gluten free breads, its very dense. It is better than most I've had though and the price is right.. I use it for bread crumbs to make meatballs.. something I haven't been able to do until recently.<br /><br />Its a good product for the money, considering how much a gluten free diet costs - I just couldn't use it for bread.. it does however make a decent pizza crust.. haven't tried it for much else.",0
"The Buffalo Bleu flavor isn't that great, at least to me.  It is a sort of barbeque flavor with a hint of tang.  I prefer the salt and ground pepper flavor, much more tasty.",0
"These taste good, but the quality of the nuts used is inconsistent. Sometimes the nuts are painfully hard and brownish, looking like an almond you found in the couch cushion years after someone dropped it in there. They are nice and crispy, but sometimes they are too hard to bite.",0
I hadn't tried Vitamin Squeezw or Mio  when I decided to give this a shot. I really liked it and used most of the bottle until I decided to pick up a few Mios  at Target for comparison.

"Emerald's Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews come in a sturdy, ergonomically designed, green-colored plastic container with an ample twist on lid that both facilitates serving and preserves the freshness of the product. The well designed and clearly written label, however, came askew and wrinkled as it is printed in a plastic paper-like material that seems to easily slip around the two large indentations on both sides of the container.<br /><br />The cashews themselves were of an excellent quality, with superb size, texture and freshness. The flavor experience, on the other hand, is open to interpretation. I have never used much salt in my diet so I found them salty and the pepper aftertaste marred the cashew flavor to the point of masking it. In other words, I could pretty much only taste salt and pepper with a hint of cashew. Other nuts, such as peanuts and almonds, bear seasoning better than cashews therefore the flavor concept might work better if understated. Because of my particular lack of exposure to salt I double checked my opinion with several family members and friends and without any input on my part they all pretty much agreed with me: the seasoning combo was too much for the cashews, albeit they seemed great to eat while drinking beer.<br /><br />They have 270 mg of sodium and 2.5g of saturated fat. The ingredients, however, are all natural and they provide a high iron, potassium and fiber content, as well as being cholesterol free.",0
Didn't care for this flavor at all.  The delievery and service were excellent. I will continue to buy miy K cups from Amazon. They have the best prices but I'll stick with the flavors I know and enjoy.....like Kona coffee and India Spice Chai Tea.,0
"Post's Shredded Wheat isn't really what's pictured on the box.  Instead of a block of wheat with one side frosted and one side not, it's a block of wheat that's very lightly frosted all over.  This isn't necessarily bad, but because the layer of frosting completely surrounds the block, it makes it more tough/crunchy than what I'm used to.  The shreds of wheat are also a little more compacted than Frosted Mini Wheats -  it's a little harder to chew if you're eating it plain without milk, but will stay crunchy a little longer if you eat it with milk.  Despite the full coating of frosting, it isn't overly sweet.  All in all, it definitely wasn't bad, but I probably won't buy it again in the future.  Try a box before ordering the pack of 4 like I did!",0
I have no idea what was growing on them but it was black.,0
"I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by ""everlasting"" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.",0
"My husband loves a good, full bodied cup of coffee.  His usual K-cup variety is the Coffee People's ""Wake UP"", but I thought we would try something a little stronger.  If  you want a STRONG cup of joe, the ""Jet Fuel"" is the way to go.  However, for our tastebuds, we'll stick witht the ""Wale UP"" for our every morning cup.",0
"I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.",0
Shipping weight is listed as 6 pounds. Actual weight of product: 1 pound 4 ounces.<br /><br />It's probably obvious to someone who knows what size a #10 can (e.g. not someone not me) is that the weight of the product would not be six pounds.,0
"I have become an enormous fan of the Blue Diamond line of flavored almonds (so much so that I buy them in bulk on amazon!).  This particular flavor is lacking, however.  ""Habanero BBQ"" should be spicy -- habanero is the hottest pepper available, after all.  Yet these are more sweet and tangy than actually spicy.  They weren't awful, but they certainly didn't live up to the excellence of some of the other flavors, like wasabi or jalapeno smokehouse. If you like the idea of a tangy bbq snack, than this might be what you're looking for.  Just don't expect it to be spicy!",0
"There's no accounting for personal taste, but I'm struggling to finish my can of Trung Nguyen Premium Blend.  The Trung Nguyen web site makes it clear that Trung Nguyen Premium Blend is NOT the same as Trung Nguyen Gourmet Blend, but I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm disappointed.  I find it to offer little of the wonderful flavor of Trung Nguyen Gourmet Blend.  You may think otherwise, of course.  Ultimately, you'll never know for sure without trying it, but I suspect most people would agree that Premium Blend and Gourmet Blend are quite different.",0
"I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product.",0
"I must say I am not very impressed with product. But it could be the recipes I tried and/or my expectations were too high.  So the product may be just fine. More like ""operator problems"". Delivery and travel time was very good.",0
"The taste of honey is just too overpowering. Everywhere you crunched all you could taste was, well HONEY! There wasn't a hint of nut, toasted flakes, nothing just pure honey. Although, I liked the texture I didn't enjoy the taste.",0
"I found that the pod made a very weak and not very flavorful cup of coffee. I didn't think it had much of an aroma either. Sadly, I would only consider this adequate coffee in a total coffee emergency. I prefer medium to dark roasts, and this just didn't have a good flavor. If you like very mild coffee, you might like this.",0
"I've tried to write this review three times now, and every time I get a power blip or something happens to the browser and I lose it.  One more time.<br /><br />I made this carefully, and it is not tasty.  It has a big packet of spices that has a lot of whey, onion, and cheese and spices like black pepper are lower than an ingredient that is listed as ""not more than 2%.<br /><br />I've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and I've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ59EQ"">Hamburger Helper, Cheesy Nacho, 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  That stuff is cheaper and tastes better.<br /><br />This stuff is easy to make.  You brown one pound of beef (I weighed it to be sure I was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, I won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water.<br /><br />Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes.<br /><br />Then remove from the heat and mix in the velveeta packet.<br /><br />They suggest that you add lettuce?  Or chopped tomatoes, so I added Ro-Tel to part of it - the other part I kept pristine so that I could taste it as made.  I used hot Ro-Tel, and, other than the flavor of the Ro-Tel it was bland.  I have to think that the pasta is sort of bland and the spicing in the packet is lacking.  It could have some more onion flavor, or more than 0.5% garlic or something.<br /><br />The value in this is what I believe to be parboiled pasta that can be cooked in this fashion.<br /><br />The net weight of this stuff is 12.8 ounces - with a pound of beef, it makes 5 one cup servings.  My wife guesses that it serves three adults, or six-eight toddlers (if you were making lunch for a day care, say).<br /><br />Now, this is my suggestion:<br /><br />Suppose you buy a piece of velveeta in the store, some cream, some beef, and a little garlic powder, some onion powder, and some pasta.<br /><br />Cook a quarter pound of pasta in one pan, boiling and draining normally, and then brown a pound or two of beef with a bunch of onion and garlic powder, to taste.  In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.<br /><br />Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.<br /><br />Dust the top with paprika before serving it.<br /><br />This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.<br /><br />Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.  Heck, Sargento six cheese is great.<br /><br />If you don't want to do it yourself, save money and buy Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I can't rate this less than 3 stars, far as I can tell, it is wholesome and it doesn't actively taste bad. It doesn't actively taste of much at all.  So it gets three stars, and a suggestion that you can do so much better by doing it yourself that you should try.<br /><br />If I had some of this stuff I had to use, I'd:<br /><br />Add a half tsp of white pepper, a half tsp of paprika, garlic powder to taste and onion powder to taste.  I might consider a knorr garlic cube.  Or Chipotle.  I would always add the Ro-Tel, this is the biggest fix you can make to this stuff. Paprika to dust the top before serving.  And, well, beef broth instead of water - that ""seasoning"" is really, really bland. A dollop of sour cream when you put the cheese sauce in, and a tablespoon of butter.<br /><br />Because as shipped, it is horribly bland.",0
"I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!",0
These taste good but I found them more oily than the Justins Nut Butter in the honey peanut butter flavor. Even after kneading them before opening.,0
"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!",0
"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It has a good flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a product that I can recommend.",0
"I got this just to try it out. I think it is ok, but head & shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better. I use (h&s) it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair & scalp clean. The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have & use h&s from now on.",0
I did not think these had such good flavor. Also kind of dry. Not very impressed by them. I guess I'd rather have club crackers with freshly sliced cheese on them. Will not buy again.,0
"I shared this with a group of my coworkers. We all tried it and though we all thought it was okay taste and ease of use wise, none of us were really that sold on the taste. Either it became way too watery, or when it was strong it just did not taste very good.",0
I wouldn't recommend this to a celiac buyer. A few of the products had gluten in it. The sneaky 'this product may contain traces of wheat.' warning was on a number of them and I had a reaction after eating them. Mild but a celiac values staying completely off gluten as long as possible.<br /><br />Celiacs beware!,0
These are basically a rebranded Nutty Bar. They don't really have a caramel nougat taste. Just crispy peanut butter and chocolate. They taste pretty good.,0
I've used MIO products before.  I was so excited to see a sweet tea option but I cannot get the correct amount squeezed in to make my water taste anything but nasty.<br /><br />I've tried the suggested serving amount and I've used trial and error.  I'm more apt to drink the more watered down experiments as there is a horrible after taste when using too much of the sweet tea.<br /><br />I would purchase this if I could actually get the correct mixture to taste anywhere near sweet tea.,0
"Its OK taste. I thought for the price will be something better, but I got a very similiar product at Target for less.",0
Neuro sleep is amazing. I ordered a 4 different kind pack and only received 3 different I'm very disappointed. None of the trim was included in my pack. I will not order this again.,0
I really like some of the Arctic Zero flavors - the chocolate was a little icy and not as creamy as I have had before.,0
"These are OK for mints- but I won't buy them again if I want a 'butter mint'.  These have a much stronger peppermint flavor, than the softer mint flavor of a traditional butter mint.  I'll go back to the dollar store for butter mints next time- but as far as a plain after dinner mint, like Fralingers, these are fine. :)",0
"Bought these three times. Initially they were sweet and plump (like someone else noted). The second time, they seemed a bit more sour, but still quite delish. I just got my third box, and they are small, sour and tasteless. You can see that a lot of them are lighter red color, meaning they have been harvested before they matured. Now I have twenty-five bux worth of sour things sitting in a box. Still edible, but I am going to see if I can use them when brewing beer or cooking something. Meh.",0
"Take a normal sized waffle, soak it in honey, smush it till it's 1/8th its original size and you wind up with this.  Honey tastes good which explains all the rave reviews.  Sure it gives an energy boost, so does raw sugar, no surprise there.  As others have said, it's a bit crumbly and falls apart easily.  All in all, organic carbs are still just carbs and this didn't live up to the hype.",0
"Love the packaging!! As for this flavor - my 2 yr old loved it but I thought it was not great, very thick.",0
"I love the idea of this food and I thoroughly believe in the EVO concept. I wish I could support them by continuing to buy their food. The problem is that my dog will not touch it with a 10 foot pole. Admittedly, she can be a little fussy, but honestly I've never seen her dislike any food this much - seems she'd rather starve. Usually if she doesn't like a food, she'll just ignore it until she becomes too hungry and then she'll eat it. With this food, she won't touch it no matter how hungry she gets. The only thing she likes less than this food is the EVO biscuits. Normally if she doesn't care for a treat she does this funny thing where she carries it around in her mouth for quite awhile and eventually hides it somewhere. With the EVO biscuits, she won't even carry it in her mouth - she just drops it immediately. Sigh. I had such high hopes for this great-sounding food. I'm sure it's fabulous, health-wise, if your dog likes it, but based on my experience I can't really recommend it, unfortunately.",0
The Gevalia coffee was good but did not have strong flavor that I was expecting.  It is a medium roast with subtle flavors.,0
"None of the Kernel Season' s Popcorn seasonings stick to popcorn. ALL the flavors taste great, I think we have tried all of them. BUT you end up using tooooooooo much and it stays at the bottom of the popcorn bowl. For some reason even trying various brands of popcorn these seasonings do NOT stay on the actual popcorn.  The selection of flavors are great, and I haven't found another popcorn seasoning brand with as many flavors, yet. ANYONE out there no of something better? I would try it.",0
I've bought these cookies before and they were just wonderful.  But these were not as good as I remember and the packing makes it difficult to retrieve a cookie without breaking it.,0
"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.",0
"This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.<br /><br />Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more.",0
"This item falls into the category of nice, but not totally necessary.  While it steams and purees in one cup resulting in fewer dirty dishes, if you already have a stove top steamer and a blender you can get the same results.",0
"I keep reading ""No Aspartame"" but there is artificial sweetner in even some of the non-diet drinks.  Gives them a funny taste in my opinion.  I love the idea of the Soda Stream...and we like some of the flavors.  Just hope they improve",0
"This coffee is pretty decent, just not what I anticipated. I was expecting a more pronounced cinnamon flavor. I think next time I will just add ground cinnamon to the coffee for the same result.",0

Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.,0
"I like spicy food and this dish is spicy.  Okra doesn't seem to be an ingredient that lends itself to long-term storage.  The Bhendi Masala has the consistency of mush.  You can't tell one ingredient from another.  As with most of the India foods, there is a high saturated fat content.  I won't buy this again.  I like the Tasty Bite entrees much better.",0
I love little debbie products and generally I consider them a great value. But $200 seems  a wee bit steep.,0
I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me.  I think Campbell's might even be better....,0
"Well, it's definitely chewy with a good texture. One bar is very filling. The taste is good but not great. I expected to taste more chocolate. Doesn't compare to the chocolate PureBar when it comes to taste.",0
"This product is great for the price. My MAJOR complaint is that the packaging is really not up to par. The container is made of a flimsy cardboard with a paper like bottom. The container sides are actually ""tucked"" up under the bottom and not glued or secured in anyway, so what do you think happens? All of the bottoms collasp. I ordered this product without reading the reviews and I have just noticed that someone else reported having the same issue. I really do not like products that can be easily tampered with. And aside from that, the warehouse that they keep the items in more than likely has rodents and the last thing I want to think about is some rodent slithering its way into the bottom of the box or nibbling on the spillage outside of the container.<br /><br />If this is how Quaker Oats packages them, than you would be better off finding them in your local market where you can at least inspect the bottom before purchasing. Imagine getting a shipment with four 42 oz boxes of oats spilling out of the containers; not great.",0

"I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?",0

"I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.<br />~T.S. Eliot<br /><br />He was my cream, and I was his coffee -<br />And when you poured us together, it was something.<br />~Josephine Baker<br /><br />I'm more of a tea girl than a coffee girl, but I definitely like some java on occasion and tend to associate it with good things: warmth on a hot day, sitting around the table with friends and loved ones, that extra jolt that helps the world make sense. And I really tend to like flavored coffees. I tried this product twice and it really left me feeling right down the middle. I didn't love it or hate it, but it was okay. The first pot was made after Sunday dinner and drank black and the second one was made yesterday morning where I drank it on the front porch while I read and bird watched while the rain fell gently and I had it with cream and sugar. These are two nearly ideal set-ups to evoke good coffee feelings, and I just wasn't impressed. There was mild gratitude for the caffeine during the morning session.<br /><br />Yes, it tasted like hazel nut, and I guess Creme Brulee, and I like both of these flavors and the coffee was smooth, but the end result wasn't as pleasing as it should be, as I anticipated it being, as the random cup of coffee at one of the local restaurants is on any given Sunday.<br /><br />Later on in the day, my husband asked me about it since he was the won I conned into brewing the second pot. I told him pretty much what I said here and that I'd probably assign 3 stars. I asked him what he thought, ""It's all right, I guess. Nothing I would rush out to buy. 3 stars sounds about right.""<br /><br />I'll drink it, but like the man said, I won't rush out to buy it.",0
"This is the second time I have ordered Skyline Chili from Amazon and this is the second time I recieved the product with dents in multiple cans.  The packaging is not at fault it is what happens before it is boxed.  This is ridiculous, if I am paying for dented items it should be in the description.  I asked last time why all the dented cans and got no response. Maybe I should look elsewhere for my chili because no one seems to care here.",0
"The first brand of GF pancake mix I attempted was Bob's Red Mill and I loved it. I went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so I tried it. It's... okay. I'm egg-free too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but I made a batch of egg ones for my in-laws and they said it was a bit mushy too.<br /><br />It's not horrible, but I prefer BRM brand personally.",0
"This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you.  Just cut the top and pour it in.  The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt.  And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt.  You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this.  If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.  But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it.",0
Decent tea.  I think the ginger overpowers a little.  Average to slightly above average herbal tea.,0
"Funny, someone just this month wrote a review saying they were sick of getting half the variety in decaf. Mine was exact opposite, we only have 2 decaf cups from the entire lot of 40! I was hoping for more than 2 decafs which is why I'm giving the seller a 3 star review. Also, the brown paper bag was a little tacky and some of the cups came with dents in them. I'm being forced to buy a 30 pack variety of decaf for the same price as the 40! I do wish they would specify at least that in the description.",0

"The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink additive has a fairly good flavor. It doesn't have a bitter aftertaste like some of the other energy additives. However, it gets 3 stars because I really didn't notice an increase in energy at all. It does have a fairly high caffeine content so I assume that is where the energy is supposed to come from. For those that are sensitive to caffeine this will probably give you an energy boost but not the equivalent of an actual energy drink.  I think if you are looking for a low calorie vitamin additive this is a good choice for you. If you are looking for an energy boost you might want to try something else.",0
"I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.",0

"Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.",0
"The label contains an allergen statement that this product was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs and wheat.<br /><br />It would be very nice if the product description here would include this sort of very important information.<br /><br />This is the second Taste Specialty spice/herbal product that I've purchased has this same warning. The first was crystalized ginger, which would have been processed in a whole different manner, and presumably on different equipment. The warning is for ""equipment"" and not ""facilities.""<br /><br />I'm starting to think that it's a catch-all liability disclaimer put on all products, given that it names every allergen that has to be labeled -- which is not very helpful to those of us who rely on allergen statements.",0
I've purchased Nutiva in the past and have no complaints but now there is evidence that storing food in plastic can cause cancer because of the dioxin so I'm opting for the glass container.  Also a couple of months ago I purchased two of them for $13.00 now it's 26.00 so glad to see there are other brands in a glass container with the option to purchase only one at a reasonable price.,0
"Had tried the regular Newman's Own and found it left an aftertast- I do use cream and sweetener but that didn't seem to affect the problem- thought the decaf would be different- sad to say, it wasn't-",0
"Just tried this this morning. Its not horrible. Texture was somewhat oatmealish with hints of bran-ness. The inherent flavor is very minimal, again akin to plain oatmeal. I suspect with some butter, salt, spices, something, you could get a passable breakfast. Or if you just want something inside you, you could eat it as is.",0
"My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24"" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.",0
"We definately got a nice assortment of K-Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured.",0
"I used it in home-made pods for Senseo. Even after I filled the pods more than the usual amount, I still got pretty weak coffee. Since this is my evening coffee, I am not too picky about the strength. But if you prefer a cup of bold, strong decaf, this is probably going to disappoint you.",0
"I love pita chips, and I love Stacy's. Unfortunately, they're way too expensive at my local supermarket for me to get whenever I want, so when I saw the great price on Amazon, I knew I had to buy it!<br /><br />Shipment was super quick--I ordered Sunday, and when I got back from work on Tuesday, they were already waiting for me on my doorstep.<br /><br />But the problem is I ordered pita chips, NOT bagel chips. The bagel chips are pretty delicious too, and I'm actually pretty happy with them, but I don't understand why they mixed up the order. Even the packaging slip on the box clearly says ""Pita chips"" and not bagel chips!",0
"I bought these because they are a quick and easy way to get my coffee fix.<br />The price on Amazon was 50% cheaper than what I saw at StarBucks stores.<br /><br />They are not as good as fresh brewed coffee, but the result is still impressive.<br />This is not the rancid instant coffee that has been around for decades.<br /><br />I gave this three stars because the flavor is adequate only.<br /><br />These will not replace brewed coffee, but will definitely be useful when I'm short on time or options!",0
"I really wanted what the picture showed. I have not opened the box of chocolate as it is an xmas gift, but the picture on my chocolate candy box is different from the one pictured here. I bought this specifically for the Jack Daniels. My father enjoys JD. I'm a bit dissapointed Jack Daniels is not included (as it is not pictured on my box). However, very QUICK shipping.",0
I was searching for muesli like I had eaten for breakfast almost everyday in London.  This wasn't quite the mix.  I think that flax seed tends to add a flavor that I don't like.  The cookie recipe on the package was pretty good.,0
my cavalier king charles has loved these since he was 3 months old and he is 1 yr and 2 months now. But they are so expensive!!! They are cheaper on wal mart 6.81 for 6.,0
"This sauce is just not hot enough for my tastes.  FYI, I eat quite a lot of jalapenos, both pickled and raw.  I was looking forward to this sauce, but it was simply not spicy enough for me.  The flavor is similar to the sauce Taco Bell used for their flatbread sandwiches they offered a while back.  There is a slight hint more jalapeno flavor than the flatbread sauce, but texturally and flavor-wise it is almost the same.  I believe this sauce is in the perfect wheelhouse for someone that does not like overly spicy food.  For people that like their faces to turn beet red and steam to come out of their ears while eating, look elsewhere.",0
"these cookies are great.  however, when i bought them here last month they were $6.25 - which was a fair price.  now they are $16.99 - seems a little ridiculous.  not sure what happened",0
"I feel like there was so much hype surrounding Baconnaise that I'd love it, but it was just OK.  Maybe I need to try it on a greater variety of food, but the reason I bought it was b/c I'm a vegetarian and thought it would make some of the things I already eat taste better.  Worth a try, but buy ONE bottle (not the three pack) in case you don't like it!",0
"I am a huge vanilla flavor fan. I love anything vanilla flavored. So naturally, I figured that I would love this coffee. The aroma is great when I open the package and dumped the ground coffee into my coffeemaker. I had high expectations for this.<br /><br />The coffee itself, once it is made is actually only decent tasting. I could only taste a very small hint of vanilla in it and it might have been because of my creamer and not the actual coffee itself. It was a bit bitter compared to other coffees that I have had and very rich. I usually take my coffee with cream and a small amount of sweetner and never really had problems with it being still too bitter.<br /><br />Next time, I guess I'll just use more cream and sweetner. Don't get me wrong, this is not completely horrible and I still enjoy Starbucks. It just surprised me as how bitter it was.",0
"and she will evetually ""give in"" and eat this food, but she doesn't ""dive right in"" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!",0
"CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce is a very manly product.  Thus, I had my husband use it and he is happy man with controllable thin hair.  There is not that burning, tingling feeling of some dandruff shampoos; instead a smooth lather is produced with a rich conditioner as well.  The scent is a spicy, heady smell and it lingers long after the washing.  Maybe a bit too strong, but in all honesty I am not sure.  I tend to like a softer, perhaps fruited scent to my shampoo's and conditioners.  My husband found it very pleasant.<br /><br />Try CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce and see what you think?",0
"[...]<br /><br />A nice mainstream coffee with no unpleasant flavors. Not too mild, not too bold, and not unduly acidic. But you had better make sure you have a large mug, because these T-discs are programmed to make a very large cup of coffee. if you have to make one drink then start your commute, then that's justifiable, but for at-home drinkers, you may get a better experience from less liquid. It won't get so cold and lose its optimum taste-delivery temperature.<br /><br />Why do you want 12 ounces of coffee in one shot? 8 ounces twice, a half-hour apart will be a much better experience. However, if you have these T-discs if you hit the button when the mug is filled to around 7 ounces, you get a nicer drink. Less over-extracted and a bit more bold. If you are looking to quench thirst, drink water before your coffee.<br /><br />As with all the T-discs, you can improve your experience by starting with a warm cup/mug/glass and by never using the add more-water-to-overextract-the-grounds feature. If you feel you must add extra water to your cleverly designed coffee drink, do it with plain water using the yellow cleaner disc, not through the spent coffee disc.",0
You can by this same size box at Sam's club for less than 1/2 this price?,0
More like a slightly darker-roast version of standard office coffee. Thin body; not a true French roast flavor. It did seem to be less acidic.,0
"Big price, small package, and doesn't taste quite as good as it does at the Embassy Suites, where I first tasted it.",0
I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang),0
"I mixed this bag in with my Kashi cereal and am enjoying the combination.  The clusters aren't too large, the cinnamon isn't overpowering, and it gives a nice flavor to the Kashi.  I would readily use this to make Granola Bread, except I dumped the whole bag into the cereal, so I can't.  I think it would work quite well.  I also think it would be very good as part of home-made trail mix, with raisins and M&Ms and the like.  Depending on price at my local grocery store, I'd buy this.",0
"A matter of taste, I prefer darker, richer roasts. This one is lighter on the coffee aroma and flavor and heavy on the acidity. A true ""medium"" coffee, I would say.",0
The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Company could have done better.<br />Compared to other brands of this variety - It's just OK.<br />JC,0
"I have purchased Coffee Bean Direct 5 lb coffee in the past and I think it is a good value for the price (slightly above average).  Thinking I'd economize, I recently ordered using ""subscribe and save"".  Unfortunately, the USPS in my area (Maine) has changed it's delivery approach.  The mail carrier does not stop or attempt to deliver a package, but instead leaves a slip requiring me to drive to the post office to claim my package.  With gas at $4 per gallon, any savings is wasted.  It's actually cheaper to use the Amazon Prime delivery as Fed Ex and UPS have no problem actually delivering.",0
"I was not overly impressed with this coffee. It was ground finely which is nice if you want to use it for espresso. And it wasn't overly sicky sweet like some flavored coffees. In fact, there was very little taste of flavoring to it. However, no matter how much coffee I added to the pot, it seemed kind of weak and bleh. Perhaps I like a coffee that is roasted more strongly. So I suppose that if you like a lightly flavored, weakly roasted coffee, this would be the coffee for you. It's just not my cuppa joe.",0
I order it because of the great review and it's not at all what it tastes like it's ok! Will not order again!,0
"Senseo, I used to LOVE you, but then your products went dark for nearly 8 months, whats a gal to do without coffee?....now I have a Keurig, and Im happy again. Why do you come back to haunt me Senseo, and where did you go all that time???? Could I trust you again? I think not....",0
"Muir Glen is proof positive that organic doesn't mean better tasting. This is a relatively dark colored tomato past, much like Contadina. The taste is a bit stale. Sodium levels are high for the genre, 35 mg per 2T serving, as opposed to 20.<br /><br />Yes, you can work with it, but there are better choices out there.",0

"I really wanted to like this coffee but just could not get there.  I am a coffee snob so I have very good equipment and even so, I could not find that perfect grind & quantity mix for a good, robust, & yet not intrusive cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you're an ""average"" coffee drinker, you'll probably like this coffee.  I just could not give it a great review as it never met my standards of what a great brew should be.",0
"This seasoned chili meat is really convenient to have on hand, but be warned--it is very spicy.  I cooked a cup and 1/2 of dried pinto beans and added 2 cans of chili no meat and a can of diced tomatoes to it.  The finished chili needed no other seasonings added.  That's how spicy strong this product is.  I can't imagine eating it on a hot dog straight up.",0
"This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Watermelon Strawberry soda. It's got a pleasant taste just nothing that will blow you away. It's a bit expensive for such a small can and not a fresh enough idea to really get anyone to Switch from their current drinking habits.",0
The coffee was ok. Not as strong as we normally like so I had to use a little more grounds but the flavor was ok then. The bag was one of those re-open bag but it would not open and when it finally did it tore a huge gash down the side. -1 star for each. Don't know if I will purchase again.,0
"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.",0
"I really LOVE Warheads. If you're ordering to get a deliciously sour treat and don't care about a specific taste, then this is a good buy. However, the distribution of the flavors is not up to par. There's plenty of apple, lemon and watermelon in the bucket, but there's very few black cherry (maybe 20 in the whole thing?) and ALMOST NO blue raspberry (I have literally only seen 5 in there). That's just completely embarrassing. When I buy an assortment, I expect close to even distribution. Why are there so few blues in there? They're the tastiest ones. I'm rather disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that, great buy. Candy's fresh and everything.",0

"I had some quinoa pasta at a relative's house and loved it. I eat kamut-spelt bread because of allergies. So I thought this combo for pasta would be good, especially since most quinoa seems to come with corn. The pasta is twisted very tight, making it thick, so it takes much longer to boil. I tried it in an alfreda sauce dish and didn't like it. :^( I much prefer spelt noodles or even rice, which are lighter weight. These things are heavy. Maybe if they are used differently? I don't know what to do with them, since Amazon sells them in bulk.",0
"This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.",0
"Bought this from Amazon Warehouse Deals, 4 boxes for $9 and change. Nowhere in the description did it say that the boxes I would receive would expire within 2 months of purchase (purchased Sept 2012, box expiration (or is it sell by?) says Nov 2012). Either way this is utterly disappointing and misleading. The organic Kashi I purchased at the grocery store in Sept 2012 does not expire until May 2013. Normally Amazon does a great job but this felt really underhanded.",0
"I ordered this based on the positive reviews but I can't say it was that great. It tasted like a regular cup of coffee...not robust or very flavorful. I do use cream and stevia so this affects the taste..perhaps those who prefer black coffee would like it. My favorite decaf K-Cup is Emeril's Jazzed Up...great flavor, full-bodied..PERFECT! So, if someone served me the Timothy's, I wouldn't complain but having compared it to Emeril's Jazzed Up...I'll stick with Emeril's.",0
"I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.",0
i have 3 rats. they enjoy many types of dog treats. only one likes these. i should have ordered the banana ones instead since banana is my boys favorite flavor. i will bring this bag to work and test it out on the customers dogs. these treats do smell pretty good and contains quality ingredients.,0
"At first I thought this coffee would be strong because it's French Roast.  However, it's extremely mild.  It has a nutty aroma when the packet is first opened.  The first sip has a mild nutty flavor, which goes away with each additional sip.<br /><br />I like drinking my coffee black, but can only do so with really good coffee that's not too strong.  Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.<br /><br />I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again.",0
"I like the concept of the little cake. If you have a friend who stops by they are the perfect size for 2 people. You throw on a pot of coffee, and you have an instant dessert to go with it. I also used a couple of these for Christmas gifts for the people I gave gift cards to...just a little something extra which was nice.<br /><br />The cake itself was not the best rum cake I ever had. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but not great or the best. When my husband & I went to Bermuda we bought rum cakes there and they were far superior. The Bermuda cakes seemed to have much more rum in them.",0
"My gulp-and-go boys thought it was great, but they think that about anything that's not moving much.  The littlest one will even eat celery, so you can't take their taste as a guide.  (Plus, his stomach is too tiny for big dog food, and I saw it again, in the wrong direction.)<br /><br />I rather wonder about all the color--that's for me, not for my dogs.  Ditto the shapes.  Supposed to make me think each little bit of not-crunchy kibble is nutritionally different?  Zip lock packaging maintains freshness, I suppose, and is, in this dog family, a PITA to use.<br /><br />My life takes me to the feed store often enough that delivery doesn't offer any real benefits.<br /><br />My picky eater will go back to getting a spoon of canned food on the kibble when we don't have table scrap to enhance her dogfood, and the chow hounds won't miss the fancy colors and shapes one bit.",0
"Actual product was fine, but expensive to purchase this way.  Just couldn't find it locally when I needed it.  Company was great to deal with.",0
"This is a good quality set of colors. I wish there was more variety of color, instead of various shades that aren't very different. A dark blue would be nice instead of a third shade of peach. The paste is thick which makes it easy to control the quantity, but harder to blend. My food color uses are pretty mundane - stuff for the kids to play with, making foods look funny, frosting, and the amount of time it takes to get the color distributed and not streaky is pretty frustrating.<br /><br />I probably won't buy them again, to be honest.",0
"I enjoyed most of the snack but not the salmon spread.  I love fish.  But this spread was too rich and not salty enough.  And it left a funny taste in my mouth.  Still, the rest of the snack made up for that.  The crackers were nice and tasty; the dry-roasted soybeans are as addictive as you'd expect and the fruit and nut mix was great.  (The nut and fruit mix does have peanuts so if you're allergic you should know that.) And the chocolate candy was fantastic.  So everything except the salmon was great so maybe the other products in that line are better.<br /><br />The only other thing I'd add is that this is definitely a snack and not a meal.  So, all told, I am not sure it's worth it for the kind of price they're asking.",0
"Product quite pricey. It tastes okay, but not a distinct cashew taste because of the honey flavoring.  Next time I would buy plain cashew butter and forego the honey roasted kind.",0
On its own this hot sauce is great.  A few drops is all you needfor most foods.  But try to mix it with anything and dissapears like it was never there.  Added quite a bit to regular size bottle of Bullseye and barely got a lip tingle.  Not a bad buy but if your planning to mix it dont bother.,0
"This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.",0
"These cookies are crumbly in texture and small enough for one bite.  The taste is pretty spicy, so you should have a glass of milk at hand.  They are certainly different from other store bought ginger snaps, but I'm not sure they are any better.  I liked them, though.",0
"I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.<br /><br />The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.",0
"It's very easy to prepare.  Just pour the powder into a cup and add hot water.  The ginger taste is very strong and spicy.  There is minimal lemon flavor.  For my own taste, I had to add more water to dilute the brew to make it less strong.",0
"we thought we were going to get a sample pack with several different flavors.  Instead, we got one large bottle of one flavor.  It's good stuff, at a decent price, but it's not what we expected.",0
"My family and I tried the Sparkling Blackberry and we all agreed that it was good, but not great.  It's better than drinking a soft drink since the sugar content comes from the fruit juice and isn't artificial.  It's sort of like having a carbonated fruit juice -- they take sparkling water and add fruit juice (70% fruit juice is what the can says).  The cans are small, perfect to pack in a lunch for your kids.  The price of Izze is a little steep, especially since they're good...not great.",0
"I found this variety of compleats to be ok at best and closer to not very good. It has the same stuffing as the turk/stuff variety. It has 1 real chicken breast-no skin. The chicken breast broke apart easily enough with just a fork but it didn't have much taste and it was dry. The worst part is the gravy. In the turk/stuff they have a brown gravy_but in this chick/stuff they have a white gravy- and it doesn't taste very good_ if they used the same gravy as they do in the turk/stuff, i would have liked it better. And since there is so much gravy in here it kinda makes or breaks the taste experience-<br />The stuffing was good. The chick breast was ok> The gravy wasn't good. If you're good with jazzing up premade meals with your own spices or condiments you might be able to give it some better taste. It's much better than the chicken and mashed potato variety if that helps anybody- the sauce/gravy in that one is the absolute worst-kinda like a white paste--yuck.<br />I like the turkey/stuffing if that helps you judge my taste buds in relation to yours.<br />To some people this really will taste good- and to others it will be horrible_ that's the thing about everybody having different taste- some people like chocolate and some vanilla-<br /><br />I ordered mine in June 2012 and the 'use by date' or 'expire' date is June 2013_ so a 1 year shelf life is very good and convenient- especially for long term storage and emergency supplies and desk drawers incase you need a quick meal at work, for the kids when you don't feel like cooking_ only 90 seconds in microwave is a miracle.<br />I only paid $2 per meal and s/h was free",0

I have been a long time fan of the Nong Shim brand of noodles.  I started eating them back when I could only get them in all Korean packaging at different local imported grocers.  Being able to buy them with more frequency online is a very nice thing.  I had waited for this specific noodle to be released here and ordered it as soon as it was available on Amazon.  While the hype was high and I do love most Nong Shim products this is good but not great.  I do like the additional packet of seasoning and the different vegetables in this bag.  It might be good if you find the subtle differences worth the premium but I would rather have about twice the regular Shin Noodle at less price.  I do like the differences but I do not believe the premium is justified on this particular flavor.,0
"I wish I had bought these from another provider, because now, looking back, I see that others posted the same thing I did. These treats were not at all what I expected. Biscotti, to me, brings to mind the kind a human would get in a grocery store. These are the tiniest bits of crumbs I have ever seen! I expected to be able to use these as training treats for my 58-lb English bulldog...he leaves crumbs bigger than this behind when he eats a biscuit! These are too small, also for my 20lb French bulldogs! The dogs seem to love them, but just be aware of the size of the individual pieces. I am posting a picture as well.",0
"I bought this for a road trip with my kids.  The taste is very good but the beef is ""moist"".  It doesn't have the same texture of most jerky.  If you avoid jerky because it is hard to eat, this would be great for you.  If you enjoy the flavor of the dried meat and the chewey texture of jerky, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.",0

"The product is good. Nice and moist.  However, it is ninety percent prunes.  It was supposed to be combination of of pears, peches apples, apricots and prunes.  To my knowledge there are no apples and not much other fruit.  But, for the price beggers, I guess, can't be chosey.  I have learned must lesson I will not be buying from Amason again.",0
"What is surprising to me about this drink is that it says ""Do Not Shake"" on the can. The color is dark brown.  It taste like a good cup of coffee, smooth and not bitter or acidic. However,  to me it is not creamy like Cappuccino.  I would have rated this 4 stars for the taste but because I do not consider this a Cappuccino I lowered this to three stars.  Each 8.45 ounce serving is 100 calories with 15 calories from fat.  The first four ingredients are coffee, low fat milk, sugar, and cocoa powder.<br /><br />Now my boyfriend really liked this drink (he shared it with me) and said it tasted very creamy to him.  He likes caffeine so at 81 mg it's about half the mg in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).  He felt this tastes better than Starbucks drinks.  However, at the current price of about $1.80 per can he thought it was too expensive and would rate this 4 stars only because of the price.  If the price were $1.25 per can,  he would buy this and have rated it 5 stars.",0
"I bought two of these in med/lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!",0
"I usually drink coffee, ice tea or plain water. Once in a while I use  individual tubes of no calorie flavors. I find Crystal Light is usually too sweet for me & prefer the store brands.  MIO isn't nearly as sweet as Crystal Light, but I'm not crazy about this flavor. I used two squirts in a 10 oz. bottle of water, then shake to mix. It's hard for me to judge how much I'm squirting into the water. A serving size is 1/2 tsp. so you might want to measure your squirts to get an idea of how much you're using. Of course, the sweetness & strength of flavor will be up to you..just use more or less squirts.<br /><br />When I mix MIO Mango Peach into a glass of water, I don't like the smell. I prefer to mix it into bottled water, the bottle opening prevents the smell from getting to my nose.<br /><br />Pros<br />Not as sweet as Crystal Light<br />0 Calories<br />Can use more or less according to your taste preference<br />Convenient<br /><br />In Between<br />The flavor of MIO Mango Peach is so, so...taste improves when it's cold<br /><br />Cons<br />It's hard to get the flavor consistent<br />I don't like the smell of MIO Mango Peach (it's better to use this in a bottle, not a glass or cup, etc.)",0
"On the box, it says these cookies are crisp and gingery and they are dipped in Belgian chocolate.  The cookies were not at all crisp.  I can't tell whether they were not stored properly, and that's why they ended up with a somewhat soft texture, or if crisp meant something else to the manufacturer.  They really weren't even soft either.  They tasted more like they had been around for awhile, and were beginning to soften.  The ginger part was correct.  I like ginger, and I found these to be fairly gingery, but the taste wasn't there immediately.  After I had eaten half a cookie, I tasted the ginger, and it had a strong aftertaste, so it was a pleasant surprise.  I am a milk chocolate fan, and I wasn't sure I would like the darker Belgian chocolate.  It wasn't very sweet, but it too was better than I expected.  Let's face it, most gluten free baked goods are going to be disappointing if we expect them to taste like the things we remembered.  In this case, I had no frame of reference for this kind of cookie, so it was probably less of a disappointment to me.  They didn't taste like generic American cookies, so that was one point in their favor.  I would like to have had these fresh, so I had a better basis to review them. I don't like really crunchy cookies, but I don't like them soft to the point of sogginess either.  These veered towards the soggy end of the spectrum, but I actually did like the flavor.  It was different, and the somewhat sharp chocolate saved them from being boring.  These were made in Scotland, and they did have the kind of flavor that you would associate with a foreign foodstuff.  My kids used to buy a similar type cookie at the British market here in town, so if you used to like imported cookies, you would probably like these.  I think they are rather pricey for eight cookies, and unfortunately, the cookies did come all stuck together in the package.  Initially, I thought they were big sandwich cookies, but I don't think they actually are.  Had I seen these cookies in a store, I would have probably passed them by.  It's an awful lot of money for eight cookies, and I'd have been cranky at getting eight soft almost soggy cookies for the price. I didn't hate them, and I didn't love them either, but I don't know that I would buy them again.  If I could be sure of getting a fresh package, I might give them another shot, but as they are, no, definitely not.  If they could resolve the packaging issues, and ensure a crisper cookie I would like them much better.  Maybe a thin cookie would have produced a better crunch. Then again, a thinner chocolate dip would have been better too.  All in all, not horrible, but I think I will stick to baking my own, in the future.  Manufactured gluten free food is a matter of taste.  If you don't have the time, and you have the money, fine, but otherwise, spend some time in your kitchen.  They will be much less spendy, and you will get a larger yield, and the pleasure of doing something yourself.  If you have to buy a packaged cookie, I recommend Glutino's chocolate or vanilla sandwich cookies.  I prefer the vanilla, but my husband eats the chocolate.  They are really close to Oreos in the chocolate flavor.  It's the only kind I buy.  These were an interesting idea, but they weren't quite right.",0
"The taste is spot on but after drinking it I felt little to no effect, but I guess that's what you'll get from a ""healthy"" energy drink with barely any caffeine.",0
"See the title, this is just plain old Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, just like if you prepare the canned variety.  Don't expect miracles, just good and gentle food for when you are under the weather.  I would not call this good everyday lunch fare.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they mean by ""homestyle.""  This may have just as well come in the can.",0
"These are not my favorite vanilla sugar wafers and the individual packets have too many cookies and once open...  Overall, they are resoundingly OK.  Lack a sharp, clean flavor with the lemon overtones that typical wafers often have.  Family does not like them but the packages keep disappearing.",0
"The smell is very nice, but the taste is a little on the weak side.  Overall not too bad, I just wish the taste was a bit bolder.",0
"I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, ""hey that happens, no big deal..."" A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, ""hey that happens, it's hot out..."" But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, ""hey these are really salty"" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.",0
"I've drank the Honest brand products with mixed success.  Their lemonade left much to be desired, but this drink proved to be a little better.  And since I have a love hate relationship with pomegranate flavored things, I could be a little biased as well.  Sometimes they're fantastic, some times they're fairly lackluster.<br /><br />Pomegranate Blue is a flavored juice made from Pomegranates and Blueberries.  And it tastes most strongly of Pomegranates rather than the blueberries.  In fact, I didn't really taste the blueberries at all.  The pomegranate too was kind of muted, and this drink tasted like a watered down version of fruit juice.  It wasn't very sweet, which actually was ok because the bottle advertised that it was ""just a tad sweet"" so it lived up to that expectation.  Someone looking for a sugary kool-aid type product is probably not going to be fond of the taste of this product.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy, which is good because that is what the Honest brand is known for.  It was a little disappointing that the juice is from concentrate, but at least its a healthier concentrate.  And a good portion of the ingredients were organic as well, which is always a plus.  The sweetener is organic cane sugar, so no nasty artificial sweeteners here.  Although I am a bit surprised that they didn't go for stevia in this drink.  And for those watching their diets, there's only a 100 calories in a 16.9 fl oz bottle.  For the juices, I was surprised to see that grape juice had a higher content than the pomegranate and blueberry juices, which was kind of disappointing since the name of the drink is Pomegranate Blue.<br /><br />Not a bad drink, but not one I'd seek out again either.  I'll keep giving the Honest brand a try, and hope that I run into a flavor I like.  They have good ingredients, but not so great taste most of the time.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",0
"These are amazing with one exception. The red in the red and white centipede/worm tastes like soap. Someone else mentioned a soapy taste and it's really just from that one color. I eat the white/clear side and leave the reds. It's not a huge deal, but it worries me thinking about what happened to that red colored side...",0
"I bought this because I only needed 24 K-Cups and I could only get the Timothy's in a 48 pack.  It's OK, I don't really taste much of cinnamon flavor, and to me, there's a weird artificial aftertaste.  I'll definitely finish the package, but I won't reorder these.",0
"It seems that this Yumberry Blackcurrat tea may have replaced the Wild Blackcurrent tea.  The Yumberry Blackcurrant is good, bur not as flavorful or have the bold fruity taste of the Wild Blackcurrant.",0
"The main reason the Newton Fruit Thins earned 3/5 instead of 4/5 is because I'm the only one who liked them out of all the people I tested them on.<br /><br />Let me back up. These Fruit Thins are flat, crispy cookies with a touch of fruit flavor (Being from the Fig Newton family, I expected a bit of moisture, but you'll never get confused that you're getting one of your daily fruit servings from these cookies).  Since Amazon sent me an entire package, I shared it with my 8th grade students and some adults. The students across the board tolerated the cookie, but wouldn't select it given a choice. The adults were mixed in their reviews. Some gave it a thumbs down, citing a cardboard bland taste, and others loved it as a low-calorie snack (about 50 calories per cookie.<br /><br />Me, I think they live up to their name--a crispy thin with a hint of fruit. If you like graham crackers, you may like these, although they aren't as flavorful. I certainly don't find the 'luscious flavor of figs, sweet raisins and honey' advertised on the package. A couple of setbacks: The fruit is so sparse--ninth on the ingredient list and behind 'folic acid' and 'palm oil'--I don't know how they can call it 'real fruit'. It is 0 carbohydrates, which is good, but it's also 0% of vitamin C, A and Calcium. You won't eat these for their nutrients.<br /><br />One complaint: the packaging is inferior. When I opened the bag and tried to use the retie at the top, it fell off, so I had to transfer the crisps to a plastic bag.<br /><br />Overall, a good choice for a snack that doesn't overfill you.",0
"Kinda weird but I tried one and it tasted awful. Not sure what is supposed to make them ""peanut butter"" flavor because I thought they tasted bland and like cardboard. Maybe a dog's palette is different because he eats them...of course the only thing I have ever seen him spit out was raw rhubarb.",0
"Great bully sticks.  No real bad odor, although there is a little of it.  Quality is good with no pieces looking horribly inedible (for a dog anyway :).<br /><br />UPDATE 5/19/2011:  I've stopped ordering these bully sticks as the quality seems to have gone down.  Not only are they are little smellier, the quality of the sticks has gone down.  They are odd shapes and sizes, and some have loose particles that fall out of the sticks...I don't even want to know what it is.",0
I love good coffee with rich flavor that doesn't hint of burnt beans. This coffee delivered in that it had an OK flavor without tasting burnt but a felt it was a little more acidic then I prefer. It wasn't a super smooth coffee but it wasn't bad for a quick cup. I don't think I'll be getting this again as I do prefer to grind my own beans but it was a nice change.,0
"Been told and I should have listened, that any flavor coffee is never going to be as good as a regular kind. The fact that they are flavored indicates that no expensive coffee is used in the preparation. I learned this lesson and I am glad this particular kind, Millstone Caramel Truffle Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2), is gone and out of our lives. Live and learn, and we all have learned not to buy flavored coffees anymore. Starting with the smell and then the taste there was nothing special to write home about it. We have graduated from those days to about to purchase a quality coffee grinder so we can enjoy beans which presumably is the way to go. In the meantime we are drinking Peet's Coffee, which in my humble opinion, is better than most Starbucks roasts. Please don't shoot me if you are a Starbucks fanatic for my only crime, if any, has been to attempt to find a good cup of coffee. One with body, gusto and why not?, class. Compared to the better coffees out there it is very apparent to determine that Millstone Caramel Truffle Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2) is just average at best.",0
"I work with a vietnamese gentleman who turned me on to their style of coffee brewing, so I figured I'd check this out. After unboxing it I was surprised by how small the filter was. I like a good sized cup of coffee in the morning, so being so small was one downside for me at least. Assembly and use are easy and straight forward, but getting that screw top adjustment just right is a bit of a pain. I brew with this using true Hung Nguyen coffee and it does a great job, if not for the fact that it lets some coffee grinds through. For me, getting coffee grinds in my mouth triggers kind of a gag reflex, so I have to fish them out before drinking. Overall though, I'd say I'm happy with the product. It works well and was cheap enough to be worth it.",0
"Great bargain if you have a few bottles going at once. The one I'm using now doesn't produce a steady stream but a spitty mist. Hold your cup high! I'll look around, but will likely end up buying again - because they work, and they are cheap. Mine were gold, some reviewers said theirs were not.",0
I got these from the store the other day and the taste is nasty. They are good for sore throats though.,0
This is the second box that i have ourchased. The first box was bits and pieces. This box is not much better. Iams is the only product my dog can eat because of pancreatitis.,0
"Not only it is cheaper if you buy via Keurig's website directly, but also the one I got off Amazon are the only tea k-cups to produce a thick layer of foam upon brewing. Come to think of it I should've returned it, but I'm already halfway through the package and there's no difference in taste.",0
Picked up a case of this just because the name made me laugh.  Nothing special about the brew.  It tastes the same as any medium blend I usually drink.,0
"I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.",0
"Caramel corn by itself would have been great. The chocolate drizzle was kind of overkill. I wish they'd make a salty popcorn product with the chocolate drizzle -- I could go for that.<br /><br />Anyway, love the individual size bag. My kid enjoyed them as well.",0

"This had no flavor or color added to it like the original commentor noted.  I think it was a packaging error, It in my opinion was just plain green tea in a superfruit box. Lipton is sending me a check in the mail for a refund.  Good customer service.  The cranberry flavor was good though.",0
"Being one of only six people in the world that eat and likes fruit cake, I was disappointed in this product. It has alot of fruit in it but the cake is dry and crumbly. My wife who hates fruit cake likes it, does this tell the story?",0
"I ordered this coffee for my daughter to try. She's a second year med student and has had some Gerd and Lerp problems. Coffee was something that she's always liked but had to give up because of acid reflux. Although the Amazon Vine offer clearly said that they would send ten 3 ounce bags, only one bag was delivered. I emailed back and asked them to send the correct order.  Lo and behold, they once again sent one bag. I contacted them one more time to explain that there must be a coding problem in their system but this time I wasn't favored with a response. In the hundreds of orders that I've processed through Amazon over the years, this is the first time that Amazon has made a shipping mistake and not cleared it up.<br /><br />So both my daughter and I tried a cup. Neither one of us had any acid reaction -- but neither one of us would have ordered it again based on the taste. We both like a stronger and bolder cup of coffee and this one was weak with some sort of strange after-taste. Not exactly our cup of tea. Keep trying though, a lot of people with acid reflux are looking for a great cup of coffee.",0
"It is too sweet that i must wash it before i eat it. But it is really made by original mango, since when i wash it few fibers of mango come out. it is cheap and after washing it tastes good.",0
"It's a microwaveable instant pasta bowl. the broccoli bits never quite soften up, the cheese has a strange aroma. Its food and that's about all one can say.",0
This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.,0
"By itself this product is a Super-Hot, salty, Tomato/Potato gruel with some other vegetables and spices.  By itself this product's heat, salt and mushy texture doesn't appeal to my palate, though the Pav Bhaji makes for a decent chip dip.  I may buy 'Truly Indian Bombay Pav Bhaji' again if the price is right, however, because it gives a lot of fire, depth and flavor to other soups, stews, chili, etc.  I especially love mixing it with 'La Preferida Refried Beans Rancheros - Zesty Salsa'.  Beware of the Pav Bhaji's high salt content of 510mg per 1/2 cup serving (21% of daily allowance).  3.25 Stars.",0
"These are exactly like the description says: like US jellybeans but gummier. I didn't like the way they stuck all over my teeth. I did, however, find their flavors delightful. If you're looking for a diferent kind of jellybean, these may be it. I, however, will be sticking to my jelly belly jellybeans.",0
"I have not tried the product, so I can't actually rate it, but wanted to list the ingredients for those out there that have food allergies such as myself. I am severely allergic to cashews, so I really need to know the ingredients of Indian food since it is quite common.<br /><br />Ingredients : - tomato, water, onion, cottage cheese, ghee, butter, cashewnut, ginger, refined veg oil, salt, garlic, coriander, sugar, red chilli, cumin, turmeric, copra, green chilli, cinnamon, big cardamom, bay leaf, clove and spices.",0
"Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.",0
My beagle enjoyed this chew and it lasted several weeks until she left it outside and then it began to break up when she chewed on it.  Probably won't order another,0
"Love the fact that these bags are biodegradable!  Helps me to feel more okay with tossing the bags after each use.  However, we've had several bags that have had leaky bottoms as soon as milk has been poured into them :(  Doesn't make me happy after having to work to get the milk.  Other than that, we have liked these bags - especially the price.",0
"There is some black stuff at the top of every bottle.  Assuming it is just concentrated mesquite product, I store the bottles upside down in the box it arrived in.  The cook has to remember to pour this seasoning on the bottom of the pan; not on top of the meat.  The mesquite flavor only seems to come out when  the seasoning is on the side of the meat closest to to heat source of the oven.  In other words,  if the cook bakes the meat and puts this seasoning on top of the meat, there will be very little mesquite flavor in the meat.  I learned this by trial and error.",0
"I am using this for as a meal replacement for weight loss purposes.  I'm definitely seeing results, however I find it to sickeningly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)! It's like over sweetened cake batter and I can't even stand the smell. However, my husband likes the flavor and is drinking it because he was encouraged by my results! I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream .",0

"These are supposed to be touched by brown sugar but where?  I am afraid this cereal is also a bit flat for me.  The puffs are not puffy at all they are quite hard and unappealing.<br /><br />In milk they do last awhile before getting too soggy but then they do not have any flavor unless you put a lot of sugar.  I am sorry this does not stand up to the usual good flavors and textures of the Quaker Oats company that I grew up on. I guess I will go back to their  oatmeal,  you cannot go wrong with that.",0
"I should have bought Goji berries by themselves because I like them.  This mix wasn't palatable for me.  It certainly may be for you.  Very healthy but those golden berries literally made me gag with their strange, planty-sweet taste and weird texture and it ruined the whole bag.  I even tried it on salads and in foods but couldn't eat it.  The mulberies didn't agree with me either.  Too expensive for the taste to be off like that.  I'll just go for the plain Gojis next time.",0
"The sea salt and pepper blend is a nice one.  A perfect mix of pepper to salt, with just enough spicyness from the pepper to give this snack a pungent, tasty flavor.  The cashews are high quality and a smooth texture.  I love the resealable package which seals in flavor and makes this the perfect on-the-go snack package.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the salt and pepper flavor though a great and tasty blend slighty overpowers the cashew flavor.  I love cashews and thus would like the flavor of the nut to shine through a bit more.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this for variety though",0
"Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water. Easy solution: Dissolves well in a little hot water, then dilute to the preferred strength. Used on a 100 km bike ride and finished with energy left over. Product works well.",0

"I decided to try this food because it's organic and has less processed ingredients than most other gerbil mixes, but my gerbils weren't as impressed as I was. The seed mix isn't as boring as a lot of commercial mixes, but apparently the millet and alfalfa pellets (a large proportion of the mix) weren't appealing enough, since I always found a lot of them left over when I cleaned the tank. I'm not sure how hamsters would enjoy this food, but I probably won't be buying it again for my gerbils.",0
"I hate how you can never tell how much of things you're getting when they have the little ""8-pack"" label on the image.  You can't tell if you are getting eight of what is described (which is already 8 and would therefore be 64) or just 1 of what is described. It seems to vary by item. I thought the price seemed very high for eight cobs of corn, and very low for 64.  Turns out it's high.  Disappointing.",0
This product is great as you will see an increase in your milk supply probably btw 1-3 days after taking these pills BUT what I did notice 3/4wks into taking it that all of a sudden I was eating like I was pregnant (increased appetite) and needless to say looking very swollen and gaining extra weight.  It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises.,0
"This is adult Kool Aid, sans the sugar. But the concept of easily controlling the level of flavor is interesting.<br /><br />The mango peach is okay. The flavor doesn't stand out - it's orange and sweet. I think it needs a little more tart.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to turn up the flavor and turn down the sweetness.",0
"You have to appreciate the uniqueness of this product. For people bored with condiment options for sandwiches and other dishes, then this product is for you. It is a bit salty for those that normally don't salt their foods, so beware. On warm foods like chicken patties, the sauce does become drippy (although I found it to taste best on chicken). Give it a try and have fun coming up with ways to use it.",0
"I absolutely love these fruit snacks!  In fact they are my favorite out of the other ""natural"" brands I've tried-- ""Yummy Earth"", and ""Surf Sweets"".<br /><br />Amazon for a time was selling the 2.75 oz. bags for about a dollar a piece (but now they're back up to $2.50+ per).<br /><br />I thought I was getting a similar deal through VitaCost, but to my dismay, it's only a box of five .08 oz. pouches, and therefore not worth the price (in my opinion)!<br /><br />Nowhere on the product page does it say how big the bags are. I should have checked VC's website to make sure; next time when it's not specific, I guess I will.",0
"These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.",0
The cashews used in this product are high quality and delicious like all the nuts sold by Emerald.  The handy green canister has the same functional design as the other snack products from this company I have tried.  But for my taste buds at least the salt and pepper seasoning is way way too strong. Cashews have a delicious flavor that doesn't need any enhancement or at least that's this reviewer's opinion.  I  realize some people will love this flavor (one of my family members who tried them thinks they are great) but the taste just isn't for me.,0
Peach and Mango is OK. I prefer plain coconut water. Adding fruit altered the natural taste of coconutwater.<br />In future i will order only plain. I was somewhat disappointed with the taste of fruity water.,0
"I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!",0
"The food tastes good, I especially like the those dried edameme beans, everything seems to be USDA certified organic food, healthy and nutritious. I asked my 8-year-old one to take one to school for lunch once because she doesn't really enjoy eating whatever is on her school's lunch menu. She liked the crackers and the salmon paste, but not everything else, it was obvious too little food for her, she ended up coming home eating double the amount of snacks she usually eats. Also, $4 per pack is a little price too me.",0
"The manufacturer claims these snack bars are made with organic, vegan ingredients. The top four ingredients, as listed, are organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, and strawberry puree. While it's clear these bars are nutritious and very possibly wholesome, they don't really taste good.  In fact, they look kind of ugly and unappetizing upon opening, and sort of smells funny, too.<br /><br />Each bar weighs 48 oz. and packs 180 calories, 20 of which from fat. There's 0g saturated fat and 0g trans fat (remember, 0g means anything less than 0.5g, since these guys are allowed to round the numbers). Cholesterol is 0mg and sodium 20mg. Total carbs is 34g, with 4g of dietary fiber and 22g of sugar, not great if you're diabetic.<br /><br />In short, if you love wholesome foods, you'll probably like this. But if you want healthy foods that also taste decent, this is probably not it, but perhaps still worth a try.<br /><br />Box says ""made in the USA,"" but no mention of where the ingredients come from.",0
"Smells terrific. However, flavor is not as potent as smell is. I found Trader Joe's Organic ""Ruby Red Chai"" to be a cheaper and more pleasing experience.",0
"I tried the Peanut Butter variety of Oreo Fudge Cremes, and they are definitely delicious- and RICH! When I first opened the pack, I was a little disappointed by what looked like a very meager number of cookies in the 11.3-ounce package.  The recommended serving size is 3 cookies.  Now, with a regular Oreo, I laugh at the regular serving size and proceed to obliterate an entire package in one or two sittings sometimes.  So I was ready to yell ""What a rip-off, Oreo!"" and be done with it.<br /><br />Then I tried a cookie.  I expected the fudge on the outside to be a little waxy and not very flavorful.  That's not the case with the Oreo Fudge Creme.  That fudge flavor was almost overpowering as I popped the whole cookie in my mouth - they're small enough to do that!  Then came the crunch of the thin Oreo, and the distinctive Oreo creme texture but VERY potent peanut butter flavor of the filling.  Imagine a piece of peanut butter creme pie with an Oreo crust exploding in your mouth, and that's close to the experience of these cookies.<br /><br />Back to my initial impression that Oreo's ripping us all off, putting so few of these cookies in a package.  People, it's a public service that they don't put more in.  At first I'd scoffed at the serving size, and while I had to try two of these cookies in pretty rapid succession (a conditioned response to an open package that says ""Oreo"" on it), I admit as I ate the third, I was slowed down considerably, more to a civilized three-bite per cookie pace.  That's when the richness and sugariness of the first two started hitting me.  I poured a glass of milk and enjoyed the rest of the third cookie, and had a fourth out of obligation to the remainder of my milk, and have decided that's the way to enjoy the Fudge Cremes- at least the Peanut Butter flavor- with a glass of milk.  I'd still rather have a package of original Oreo Cookies, or Double-Stufs, but I do like that the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes encourage drinking a glass of milk, and I do think that three of them is quite a generous serving if you're enjoying a glass of milk and taking the time to enjoy each bite, instead of wolfing down a handful.  They're a fun treat I think even Cookie Monster would approve of... in moderation.",0
"These were very large and very mushy. Not the best I have ever eaten, would recommend looking for another source.",0
My cats ate it but they didn't seem to like it to well.Wouldn't buy it again.,0
"I took these bars on a recent camping trip and was disappointed in how unsatisfying they are. After about half an hour I was hungry again. They are tasty, kind of like a stepped-up Nutri Grain bar, but I would rather have the extra 20-30 calories and be more satisfied.",0
"Considering the price, this is a decent soup, but please don't put the name of my home state on the can. There is probably a gram or two of crab meat on average in a can of this soup, and it's usually all chopped up to the point where you can't even bite into it. We don't take that in MD. Real Maryland crab soup is probably 10% crab by weight and features chunks of crab you can bite into and taste the love. This is vegetable soup stirred in crab meat.<br /><br />4 stars when it's $1 a can, 3 stars for &lt; $2.",0
"I thoroughly enjoy Betty's and Taylor's of Harrogate.  I had high expecations for this tea but it is quite mediocre.  Yes, it's far better than PG Tips, but frankly, I think I prefer Tetley's.  Even Lipton comes close to this Yorkshire Gold.  There's just nothing exceptional about it.  I expected to to be more like the better whole leaf teas that I enjoy.  It's just another bag of dust and fannings.  For an everyday tea, it's barely drinkable.<br /><br />Everyone has their preferences.  Some like Darjeeling, Ceylon, Yunan, or traditional blends like English Breakfast.  Some like bergamot (Earl Grey) or the smokey flavour of Lapsang Souchong or a Scotish Breakfast.  Personally, I favour a pure Assam.  It's hard to tell exactly what Yorkshire Gold is.  They say it's a blend from twenty tea gardens.  I suppose that actually means it's a collection of nearly everyone's refuse.<br /><br />Taylor's does sell better quality loose leaf teas and although I haven't tried enough of them, I'm sure they're quite good.<br /><br />Update:  I have found that this makes the most outstanding iced tea.  I highly recommend it for that.  For a cheap bagged tea, I stand by Tetley's.  But yeah, I do prefer a whole-leaf Assam, and I've got nothing against Taylor's.",0
"pros: organically processed organic beans<br /><br />cons:  very light - tastes light a very watered down cup of java, even when brewed using 8oz setting.  I'll have to try a smaller setting, but really, it feels like it'd just be a waste as I'd like more than just a 6 or 4oz cup.  It's is quite lght however that I'm not optimistic that I would make much difference.  *FYI : I drink my coffee black.<br /><br />Good news: I purchased these for my teens who sometimes like a cup of creamy coffee, and... this satisfies their coffee cravings.  So three stars because it's not what I would usually purchase again, but the teeners like it.",0
"Very flavorful oil, makes a huge difference when drizzled over vegetables, or in a vinaigrette. Unfortunately the bottle isn't very good - the cork doesn't seal well, and the little ""spout"" on the bottle is prone to dripping. There was even some leakage during shipping - just a drop, but there shouldn't be any.",0
Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.,0
"Like the majority of other meals in the Hormel line, this one is excessively salty. That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasn't swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.<br /><br />But it's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill. It's not my favorite of this type of meals but I wouldn't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon.",0
"This little gem of bacon doesn't match up with its bacon-pop rivals. The bacon flavor is just not intense enough for my bacon-loving standards. Makes a good gag gift, not so much satiating the need for bacon in my mouth.",0
"I love genmaicha tea, so I was happy to find some in tea bags for drinking at the office. Unfortunately, the roasted rice flavor in this tea is very mild. I find myself using two tea bags to get a decent mug of tea.<br /><br />Even worse, the bags are not great. Most of them have small holes in them, allowing the tea to leak out. I've taken to grabbing my trusty office stapler, locating the hole, and stapling it closed before brewing the tea. Because of this, I will not be repurchasing.",0
"This was quite a disappointment compared to the Idahoan potatoes I bought previously on Amazon. Very thin texture, flat taste, bland, will not get again.",0
"Oh well. I thought that ""Value-Box"" meant real, bulk value, as it usually does here. But 36 tiny little bags x 1.5 ounces = 54 ounces, which = 3.375 pounds. If I buy a pound of pretzels at the store for about $4.00 (the high-end), a bit over 3 pounds of pretzels (even Snyders) don't cost over $26.00! I could've bought over 6 pounds of pretzels at this price, at least 96 ounces. Snyders comes in 18oz bags for less than $4.00 at the store! In my rush to order treats, I thought that ""Value-Box"" meant the bags were 8oz each - my error. These mini-servings of delicious Snyders pretzels may feed a few mice for a little while, but not my barbarian hoard. The following selections are a much better value, if you do your own ""portion control"" and don't want to pay for extra packaging: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V394"">Snyder's of Hanover Hard Sourdough Hard Pretzels, 13.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NNDDTU"">Snyder's of Hanover Honey Mustard & Onion Pretzel Pieces, 12-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>, and/or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012DM8ZY"">Snyder's of Hanover Olde Tyme Pretzels, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.",0
"Blended and packaged by the Stash Tea Company, makers of high-quality teas, this is tea for the throat chakra, also known as the 5th chakra, which relates to the color blue.  It is called ""Blue Ginger"".  (A chakra is an energy center in the body.  We are generally said to have 7 major chakras.)<br /><br />This caffeine free herbal tea is made of 100% natural ingredients (per the wrapper), listed in order as ginger root, blue malva flowers, vegetable juice for color and natural (tropical) feijoa flavor.  As do all the flavors, each tea bag comes sealed in an individual foil package to preserve the freshness and delicate flavor.  (If you are a tea lover, this matters to you.)<br /><br />The color is yellow.  Even with 2 bags for 24 oz water, the taste is smooth but weak with the bite of ginger.  You do taste the ginger in sufficient quantity, but it doesn't have any special other taste that I notice.  Although not one of my favorites, it will probably be useful for settling an upset stomach. (Note-I am NOT a doctor.)  Don't we usually go looking for ginger-ale for an upset stomach?  Well, if you check the ingredients, it's hard to find ginger listed in ginger ale anymore.  This tea has ginger as its primary (most plentiful) ingredient.<br /><br />So, it has an acceptable taste and is probably useful for calming the stomach.",0
"Chips weren't crisp - and not as good as I remembered<br />don't think I will order again, but  - They were packaged<br />very well.",0
I ordered this item for a friend as I do not care for Diet Coke. I can't give it five stars because I much  prefer Diet Pepsi.,0
"My dog seems to like this just fine and dandy. She's happy to eat it but I don't like the fact that it is so mushy. She's not a big dog and it takes her forever to lap the food up. Yes, I know, it's probably good exercise having to work to eat her food but I don't like to have to work to eat my food so I don't want her to either.",0
I was very excited to find this product...and very disappointed when I ate it! I didn't taste any sweet potato at all. The whole wheat flour taste (which I am very familiar with & use almost exclusively) came through in a very strong way.,0
"I didn't like this coffee. It did have a good smell when I first opened the pack, but that is about it. I like a medium to strong flavor in my coffees and this was just plain weak. I guess if you have stomach problems or just like a light coffee this would be great, but anyone who likes alot of flavor won't like this.",0
"It sounds like this is good and it is.  I would rate it slightly higher than the cheeseburger mac that hamburger helper does.  However, it should not go unnoticed that on sale at the grocery, HH is often a dollar or less per box. The price on this item on the Zon here is pretty far out there, so from that perspective add a star if you find this in the grocery or a good online sale.  Subtract one if you are going to buy it on some of the high prices it's offered for here.<br /><br />I'll give Kraft credit here for saving their brand name for me and doing a set of quality items in the package. The taste combined with my drained washed and reseasoned ground beef was very good.  I like to add a little red wine, some mushrooms and some half and half to the sauce on these to give them a classier taste.  The cheese held up well. I took exception to those eazy mac things they did up a few years ago.  I can't imagine anyone liking them unless they were starving!  The question I have on this product is why...  Yes there's improvement over HH, but not that much, they don't do much different, if they sent it with a can of pre-cooked ground beef, and you could just heat it up that would be something. I don't get how this can compete, especially at the price.",0
I've bought these cookies before and they were just wonderful.  But these were not as good as I remember and the packing makes it difficult to retrieve a cookie without breaking it.,0
"I don't really know anything about the different companies that are selling Kefir.  Just for fun, I purchased Milk Kefir Grains from Keysands and from Lifeway.<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of Keysands Kefir.  These batches did produce a drinkable beverage.  The 4th batch did seem to be getting somewhat thicker than the previous ones.  Overall, the Kefir from Keysands has been more sour than the one from Lifeway.  I do understand that the flavor may change over time.  I will say, though that the replication of the kefir has been impressive.  Even in such a small number of batches, I have significantly increased the number of Kefir grains I own.  Excellent!<br /><br />I feel like the Keysands Kefir is a little more ""touchy"".  If I let it go just a bit too long, it separates aggressively into curdles.  But if I remove it prior to this point, so far the product is a little bit thick, but not overly impressive.  But I do feel like I have to watch it a lot more, and be home to catch it when it is ""done"".  I have now put it in the refrigerator, and am working with the Lifeway Brand.<br /><br />The other brand immediately produced a much thicker kefir, and the curdles were very fine.  Even within two batches of the other brand, I had a thick and smooth result - that didn't need any monitoring or doctoring.  The flavor of the other is, so far, more mild, and the increase in grain size a little more slow.  However, I feel like the other brand does not need to be ""babysat"".  It is OK if it sits a little too long, because I won't end up with a useless pile of super thick milk curdles.<br /><br />Pros:  Rapid increase in number of Kefir Grains, Produces a drinkable - slightly thick beverage with (so far) a fairly sour taste<br />Cons:  Curdles too easily and needs more monitoring, has not yet produced a very thick beverage (although it may with more time/effort - the con being that it is taking more time/effort)",0

"Fairly tasty and filling, however there are other products from Nong Shim that I would recommend over this one. The noodles are not as good as those in the packaged soups, don't know why, and there is not a great deal of kimchi. It is nice and hot though, as I would expect from Nong Shim.",0
"When I was a child my Father would always purchase antipasto in a can. It was imported from Italy.<br />It came in a round can it had sardines, capers, anchovies, tuna, olives,peppers,pearl onions.Packed in Olive oil.<br />with a sweet tomato sauce.The can was yellow with a embossed sun image smiling on the top of can.<br />It was delicious. They stopped importing it because the demand in Italy was so high.<br />I was trying to experience the same again with this product!<br />when I opened the can it was full of liquid and had a very bad fish smell.<br />I rinsed the contents off and added olive oil and a bit a ketchup to recreate the same as the Sole brand.<br />It was similar after I doctored it up I'm going to buy the items separatly and make  my own in the future.",0
"The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it. She didn't do that with the other brands I've given her (IAMS, Hill's science diet, the goodlife recipe). She seems to really like this food and she hasn't thrown it up. I'm not a vet so I don't know how nutritionally sound this product is, but it lists a lot of organic ingredients and it has chicken as one of the first ingredients. I'll post pictures of the bag with that information. I know Newman's Own is a quality brand (I use their pasta sauces and salad dressing) so I imagine this product is high quality as well. It sure seems to be.<br /><br />Update 8-16-12: My cat does not seem to like it anymore after the first week. I mixed it with her old food and she picks around to avoid the Newman's Own pellets. I tried putting just Newman's Own in one dish and the other cat food in another. She won't eat the Newman's Own when it's separate either. I guess she prefers the cheaper cat food.",0
"I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24.",0
"Jack Link's Beef Steak, Flavor, 1-Ounce Packages<br /><br />These are a nice snack, maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS"">Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)</a><br /><br />Gunner March, 2010",0
This was the first time I had tried Kind Bars and thought the Macadamia and Apricot would be a good one from the reviews. I liked them ok but I didn't find them amazing. I also didn't like that they have soy lecithin in them. I will stick with Larabar.,0
Not as good as i had hoped for. The vanilla flavor needs to be stronger.,0
"I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.  The description of ingredients for Frutto Bianco pearls seems heavenly: kiwi, coconut, and tropical fruit bits.  I read several customer reviews that equated their experience of drinking this tea to lying on a beach in Hawaii (which definitely enticed me!)  However, after thoroughly enjoying most other Teavana white teas, this one was a disappointment.  The aroma (one of my favorite things about these teas) was very mild and not altogether pleasant.  Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).  Once nice thing about this tea are the ""pearls,"" these white tea leaves are even more unprocessed than other forms and present as lovely round spheres which slowly unfurl once they are brewed.",0

"For some people, excessive coffee consumption can pose health problems or it might just make it hard to sleep at night or give them the jitters. ENTER ""Postum Caffeine Free Original, Instant Hot Beverage"", which has been around since the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />With Postum, the usual mistake is simply to start drinking it in place of coffee. The sharp contrast in taste and lack of caffeine often makes this a solution doomed to failure. A better method is to add some Postum to your coffee or to have the ""Postum"" at night if you can take the caffeine during the day and simply let your body tell you how much caffeine you are okay about replacing in this manner.<br /><br />Of course, you could apply the same approach with decaffeinated coffee, so it is a matter of taste. By itself, however, I find ""Postum"" very bland and unsatisfying. Nevertheless, I attempt to replace some of my coffee consumption in this manner every five years or so.",0
"The idea of a carbonated 100% fruit juice seems like a good one, but for me Switch doesn't deliver on its promise.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the fruit juices here are from concentrate, and though the flavor is supposed to be black cherry, that benighted fruit is supplemented by larger portions of apple, grape, and acerola fruit.<br /><br />What in the world is acerola?  I'm fifty-something, and I've never heard of it before.  Or is this some chemist's name for a synthetic fruit, as ""diamonique"" is the synthetic version of diamond?<br /><br />Well, whatever.  The point is, a buck a pop is pretty pricey for such a little can of soda, and most folks will probably prefer a regular-sized can of black cherry soda for the money.<br /><br />I also think this is a little over-carbonated for my taste, but drinking it with ice might solve the problem.<br /><br />Finally the can design is hideous.  If it weren't for the three cherries pictured, you might think that this was a can of drain unclogger or something.<br /><br />So I've taken the bait -- and now I'll Switch back to my real favorite, fresh apple cider.  Even here in NYC, a gallon is only $5 at the farmer's market, and the stuff tastes better and is actually good for you.<br /><br />It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature!",0
"Summary:<br />This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.<br /><br />Pros:  Bottle looks cool?<br />Cons:  Price, from concentrate.  Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic"" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.",0

"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.",0
"I do not have a huge amount of espresso bean experience.  I've been grinding my own beans for drip coffee for many years, but just started my home espresso operation.  Compared to some other beans I've tried, the Lavazza beans were distinctly less oily.  There's a bit of ""chaff"" or ""husk"" during the grinding process.  This may be perfectly normal, but I was more accustomed to oily beans that maintained a bit of heaviness.<br /><br />The flavor is good and balanced, although not at all aggressive or robust.  (This could have something to do with my process, I really can't speak to that.)<br />Pulling a double to make caps or macchiatos, the flavor is very satisfying.  However, the additional milk in a latte bumps the need to at least a triple shot.<br /><br />No burnt flavor at all.  Crema is easy and consistent.",0
"The first thing to know about these candies is that they are not gummies in the typical sense.  I'd classify them more as jellies.  They are much softer than gummi bears, so soft that they would all be merged together into one blob by the time you bought them, _except_ that they have a stiffer ""shell"" on the outside to help them keep their shapes and remain separate.  That part works fine, and even in warmer temperatures they hold up well and don't get sticky.<br /><br />The combination of the stiffer outer shell and soft center (similar center consistency to sunkist fruit gems) make the overall texture kind of interesting, and I think it might grow on me over time, but I still prefer the good old Gold Bears I grew up on.  For a change, these would be good on occasion though.  They also don't stick to your teeth like Jujyfruits do, so that's another plus.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty good, and a little more interesting than typical gummi flavors, but it seems like there's something missing in the flavor mix, perhaps another tart flavor in there would better round things out, or a more intense flavor of some kind.<br /><br />Of the four family members that tried them, one hated them, two loved them, and I'm still kind of on the fence, so I'd rate them 3-3.5 stars overall.  Good, but not exceptional unless you have a particular liking for the texture and flavors, or if you remember them from childhood or a memorable trip overseas, etc.<br /><br />Also note that the packages I received (Aug 2011) actually said ""Made in Spain,"" while the Amazon product description still says Made in Germany as of right now.  Unfortunately, it seems very difficult to purchase any Haribo products in the US that are actually made in Germany anymore.",0
"Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me.

Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.,0
"GREAT -- for flavor.  Love the instant maple packets.  Plain Cream of Wheat is too plain, and I have to add sugar and dried fruit (blueberries, raisins, something!). Which also means buying and storing expensive dried fruits, sugars, etc.  Maple flavored Cream of Wheat is great as-is, with no additions.  I'm a serious fan at this point.<br /><br />GREAT -- for prep.  I live in a cabin (no power, water, or heat) about 1/3 or more of the year.  Boil-and-serve foods are important so I can conserve fuel use.  Also important are a fast prep and clean-up because I have to do it outside.  Yes, I do mean outside in the cold, rain, wind, sleet, snow, etc. -- because that's where my stove is.  Cream of Wheat really fits the bill:  Fast prep, fills me up for hours, gives me a warm stomach even on freezing days, and has really easy clean-up.<br /><br />PANNED -- for price.  I give the amazon product listing a LOW RATING -- 1 star on this.  My local grocery's standard price for a case is $39.86.  Amazon wants $60 for the same thing.  That's an outrageous difference -- a 50% markup from the local store.  My advice:  Call your local grocery and ask for the case price.  You'll save big bucks.<br /><br />  - tkh",0
"When my dog was a puppy I bought her the medium size. She is a golden retriever and I used the medium until she was around 30 lbs. At that point with her puppy teeth, she would slowly chew these.  She had bad puppy breath and these helped a ton with that. However, I bought her the large size when this box ran out and she no longer chewed them slowly. She would finish one in under four minutes with no change in the smell of her breath. We brush her teeth and she has other chews that last much longer but her teeth were white with no plaque while using these. If your dog is a slow chewer and has bad breath these are worth it, otherwise they are fairly expensive for a quick treat.",0
"The 60s decade box I ordered arrived in tact, and all the candy inside the box was in fine shape, (nothing was smashed or cracked), each item was full sized and fine.<br />I only gave 3 stars for the selection. Allthough the pieces were indeed items enjoyed in the 60s, I felt the inclusion of candy that is still sold commonly today somewhat took away from the nostalgia, ( an O Henry Bar as one example). The variety of candies may differ for others as stated in the item description, so my minor dissapointment in the selction I recieved will not be everyone's experience. I also recieved a duplicate of one of the candies. For the price I felt it should overall have been a better variety of 60s candies.<br />On a final note, and it bears repeating, the candies were all in fine shape so the quality of each item in the box was not compromised. I only feel the nostalgic value of the items would be at say 60% for what I recieved. I feel it is worth perhaps half the price I paid. (not including s&h).",0
"Since I have an assortment of dogs, I was delighted to review the dog treats. I gave them to three German Shepherds, a cocker Spaniel and a Rat-cha. I am glad to say I only had one that got loose bowels and only for one day. It was one of the German Shepherds. All the dogs seemed to enjoy the treats, for its rare that I give them rawhyde. Although the Rat-cha had some difficulty with the size of the product, the Cocker and Shepherds had no trouble at all. They appeared to have liked them with no other negative effects. Although I am sure they would appreciate another taste, I don't think that I will be purchasing the product.",0
"This granola tastes great, if you like Chocolate. but if you like chocolate covered berries, this really isn't the thing.<br /><br />because there is hardly any berry flavor. The chocolate over powers it.<br /><br />it tastes good but just not Chocolate and red berries. It's more like Chocolate and a hint of red berries.",0
"I ordered this to alternate with the Clear Ultra Shea shampoo, which, for a sulfate containing shampoo, I actually like. This Damage and Color Repair version has a very strong frangrance in comparison with the Ultra Shea, and for an alleged restorative shampoo, seems pretty drying to my color treated hair. This requires extra time with a conditioner, which is not the case with the Ultra Shea. The product was not a home run for me, and I will likely not purchase it in the future.",0
"The sugar content is more than I thought it would be, wow, are these sweet. I love sugar, but not that much, in my desserts.",0
"These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit. The bars are not hard or crunchy but they are not chewy either.  Texture is kinda like a snickers bar.  Easy on the teeth.  Everyone in my family has loved these bars.  I thought the price was a little high but now that I've tasted them, they are completely worth it.  I used to buy Clif organic Z bars which weigh 36g and these are little bigger at 40g and much better tasting and more nutritious.<br /><br />Update:  I've downgraded my rating because I just bought the peanut butter dark chocolate + protein and it contains soy protein isolates which are difficult to digest and can cause GI distress.  I heard one of the owners of the company on a podcast (Romy Nelson) talking about the cons of this very protein and why they did not use it about a year ago.  What gives!",0
Signed up for auto delivery because this seemed like such a super deal.  Not so much.  They're ok but have kind of a funky taste and texture.  My two older kids will eat them.  My youngest likes the chocolate but gags on the vanilla.  Literally gags.  Not a feature I appreciate in an emergency snack.  We've tried the other flavors too- snickerdoodle and ginger.  Mixed reviews from my crew on those.  All in all they aren't the worst GF snack I've bought but I cancelled auto ship on these as I expect it will take an eternity to go through the 6 boxes we have now.,0
this food looks pretty good. My dog loves the food but it looks bland. All of the food nuggets look the same. Ingredients say that there are no food meal in the product but I cannot tell.,0
"My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.",0
"We recieved the Soda stream and in a later shipment the mixes. They packed it next to our Xbox we ordered. The mail man brought it to the door dripping. I opened it to find they packed it with nothing to protect it between the large item and the mixes, it exploded everywhere. I salvaged the ones that didn't open and cleaned them. I do not have time to send it back...I'm sure it is not a bad product, they just need to learn how to pack them :(",0
"The taste of a Haribo Happy Cola Gummy is quite honestly a miracle. I still have no idea how they're able to take such an intense amount of cola flavor and pack it into a teeny-weeny piece of chewy deliciousness. It's downright succulent! If I had a five pound bag on me at this very moment, I'd down them all in an instant...but not before I pinched my nose with a clothes pin.<br /><br />These things reek. Every bag I've ever bought knocks me on my haunches and I've come to accept the bad odor as a bit of extra baggage. Sometimes they smell like poop, sometimes they smell like vomit, but they always smell wretched whatever the case. Not only do I avoid sticking my nose anywhere near the bag, but I have to wash my hands as soon as I'm finished snacking! It's sick!<br /><br />If the smell which emanated from these little guys was that of a freshly cracked can of soda pop, five stars would be issued all around. But it's not. It's the same stench that I wake up to after a hard night on the town.<br /><br />Once again, the taste is great. I still eat them after all, so I can't knock 'em completely. Buying a bag wouldn't be a mistake, but opening the bag in a small, draft free room would be.",0
"It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!",0
Don't bite down too hard until you understand how hard and chewy this is!  Good taste but a bit too dry for me.  I will eat what I ordered but won't reorder.  I'll keep looking for a good salmon jerky.,0
"It is difficult to find. I do not know how many boxes you get from Amazon, but the price is over 100.00.",0
This isn't bad but it isn't anything spectacular. I've tried this and Taste Nirvana's brand and honestly I prefer Taste Nirvana because it tastes more natural.,0
"I was really looking forward to tasting the one bottle of water since I drink a lot of it (water). I buy Smart Water by the case. I have a sodium deficiency so need the electrolytes in the Smart water. I also live in a town that has no public water at all. We all have well water as our supply.<br /><br />This is a 1.5 bottle of water, which is a nice size. I drank it in one day and within that day I did get sick. I did not think it was the water until I read what alkaline water can do to you. I read, can't claim it, but read that the alkaline detoxes your body and neutralizes the acid in your stomach. We need acid in our stomach to process the food we eat. I read a lot of people that got sick drinking alkaline water, it might be a small percentage but I was one of them. Supposedly over time after it `cleanses' out yours system, you will feel better. With one bottle and getting sick, I cannot say that.<br /><br />It did taste good but not great. I could taste an aftertaste that was metallic like and it just did not seem crisp to me. I did finish the whole bottle, again in one day, but sadly would not buy this or drink this again if given a few more.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many additives, good or not, but yet no claims can be made or studies have been done to prove the benefits, I am leery.<br /><br />Yes it was good, not great, but getting so sick on the day I drank it and reading others that went through the same thing online is enough to keep me away.",0
"I have 2 dogs.  My Great Dane showed quite a bit of interest at first, but it wore off after the first few hours of having a new toy and he pretty much ignores it now.  My smaller dog, a Heeler, had the raccoon destroyed in less than 2 hours, managing to chew through both ends and removing both squeakers.  Once the squeakers were gone (and I threw them away before she could swallow them), she completely lost interest in the now quiet toy.",0
"If you like soft licorice that contains aniseed oil as a flavouring, you'll love these. The texture is perfect. However, the weird taste that lingers on your palate after you've eaten ""black licorice""? Yes, that's not licorice; that's anise.<br /><br />These Pontefract Cakes are advertised elsewhere as being ""much stronger in flavor from the previous Pontefract Cakes, which were manufactured by the Haribo company"", as though ""stronger flavour"" is necessarily a good thing. Ha ha. You got it. Anise is the MSG of the licorice world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was the only brand in stock and available for me to purchase, here in the USA. They are labeled ""Gustaf's Licorice. Made in the UK for Gerritt [sic] J. Verburg, Michigan"", and I'm pretty sure the same product appears under both brand names (Gerrit Verburg and Gustaf's) as different items on Amazon.<br /><br />They are not so bad that I won't eat them whenever I have a lust for Pontefract Cakes, but the anise flavour is disturbing enough that eating them dampens my ardour for more. In other words, this 2kg bag should easily see me through until the day I can replace it with the real thing, possibly the boring old unenhanced licorice flavoured Pontefract Cakes from Haribo. Assuming they still do make theirs the traditional way, without aniseed.<br /><br />Still, these Pontefract Cakes do get a 3-star rating simply for being better than almost any other form of licorice candy available in the States. As I say, if you are used to anise flavoured ""licorice"", just ignore my licorice snobbery and give them a try.<br /><br />--<br />Ingredients as listed on the bag I got: Sugar Cane Syrup, Glucose Syrup, Modified Corn Starch, Invert Sugar Syrup, Wheatflour, Liquorice Extract, Potato Starch, Glazing Agent (vegetable Oil, Carnauba Wax), Aniseed Oil. Allergen Information: Contains Wheat and Gluten. May Contain Taces of Sulphites.",0
"The first time I tried these, they were absolutely amazing. The fig-center was slightly gooey, and the cookie was soft. It brought back memories of the gluten-filled fig newtons I had given up 3 years before. I bought a box a few months later, and was sorely disappointed. The fig-center was more like a gelatin rather than gooey and the cookie crumbled with the slightest touch. The only thing I can figure is that the first batch I tried must've been incredibly fresh. I've bought a couple of boxes since then hoping for one that tasted as fresh, but I haven't had any as good as the first one.<br />I like that they're packaged in twos for easy grab-and-go snacks and for portion control. I just have to be careful not to squish the packs in my bag...crumbled cookies! I also like the sweetness of the fig-center, but the oustide cookie part really doesn't have much flavor.",0
"This soup, as another reviewer mentioned, has a smell to it that can certainly frighten someone away. Be brave, though- give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It definitely has flavor (although not as Tom Yumish and spicy as I was looking forward to). Simply put, I would choose one of these over those dry-noodle MSG cups any day.",0
"The sardines in the batch I purchased came from Morocco. These sardines while very tasty without any fishy taste (almost like eating tuna fish), were not firm and crumbled upon<br />removal from the can. This is a feature I do not like. The sardines should be firm and solid. It is because of this that I have downgraded the sardines. Even though a can contained 200 mg. of sodium the fish were not salty tasty.  There were five (5) fish in the first two cans I have used so far which I consider excellent.<br />The sardines were purchased from Amazon.com.",0
"This product is okay, but I did not really care for it.  It is extremely mild and tastes like milk with just a teaspoon of cappuccino in it.  It is smooth and doesn't taste bad; it just doesn't taste like a cappuccino.  It certainly doesn't have the rich espresso taste advertised.  You can barely taste any coffee flavor to it at all!  If you like real cappuccinos and are looking for a faster, easier alternative, this isn't it.  You'll be very disappointed.  If you don't like coffee or espresso drinks but are looking for something much milder to drink, you might like it.",0
"I get this olive oil through Subscribe and Save and really like it.  It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews. I depended on my regular shipments for my cooking needs and now I need to look for another affordable replacement until Amazon puts the price back down in the normal range (if they do).",0
"We have bought these from a variety of sources over the past 2 years.  This bag came and the chicken meatballs seemed to be an odd texture with pink centers and a lot harder than any of the others - we ended up tossing most of the bag.  All in all, our dogs really like these.  We put them in their kongs and it takes a little while for them to get them out.  One of the dogs has figured out if he throws the kong in the air it will bounce and knock the meatball loose.  He gets exercise as well as being entertained for a while. So the 3 stars are for either poor quality control or a bag that sat in storage for way too long.",0
The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.,0
"Our dog will not eat the Wellness Wellbar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats; however, we crush two of these up for each daily feeding and mix them with his regular dog food.  For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!<br />We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year.  He loves these.<br /><br />  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H3R2E"">Wellness WellBar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats, 50-Ounce Pouch</a>",0
"I bought these hoping to find a way to make a cappuccino-like drink using our Keurig.  This Cafe Mocha K-cup on its own tastes like hot chocolate.  It also tastes slightly watery and I really can't taste any coffee at all.  I was bummed since this isn't really what I was looking for.<br /><br />Since the chocolate taste was so strong & the coffee taste was so weak, I decided make a mug filled with half Cafe Mocha and half flavored coffee by selecting the small cup size for each.  Tada!  An at home Mocha!  I will continue to buy these so I can mix them with my other coffees.  If you don't mind using two k-cups per drink, they are a good way to go for a tasty at-home mocha.  If mixing this with another cup seems to expensive or like too much trouble, then skip these ones - I would give them only 1 star on their own.",0
"I prefer beef jerky and if this weren't on sale than I probably wouldnt have bought it (horray for amazon lightning deals) Anyways, the taste is fine, but you have to enjoy turkey. I definitely prefer beef jerky over turkey jerky but if you really like turkey go ahead and buy it. But you really might be better off just getting 1 pack at the store.. I can eat an entire pack as a quick snack because there is not much in there..",0
"I got these to serve a crowd of kids at a party.  They are very bland with no butter flavor so they never made it to the table.  I did find a way to use them, in cookie crusts for other desserts.  Mix with melted butter and flavorings and press into pie pan or springform pan.  I also made rum balls with them, so as a blank canvas they are good.",0
"Ok, first let me say, this is not the healthiest of meals so if you are on a health kick, this one isn't for you.<br /><br />I personally love this kind of stuff so I was very excited to try it.<br />it's easy enough to make, brown the ground beef, drain, add water and pasta and the flavor pack and then add the cheese.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I wasn't too happy with this one.  it lacked taste.  I don't think there was enough cheese or the normal Velveeta cheese that you can buy in the store.  It seemed to lack the cheese taste when the meal was said and done.  The cheese seemed a bit watery and really not enough.  So we ate 1/2 of it in one meal and the next day, I added a bag of frozen veggies to it and I also added salsa and more cheese and it tasted good.<br />I don't think the cheese that comes with the meal is the same one that you buy in the store.  I really did water down and lacked taste.  If you want to try it, get some Velveeta and add it on your own.",0
"While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon.",0
"The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?",0
After reading all the hype I was lured in to buying this so-called coffee.  Tastes like coffee grind recycled after first use.  The coffee we buy from local super market costs the same but tastes much better.,0
"I really wanted to enjoy these flax crackers. I like the fact they are organic, raw (dehydrated at low temp), etc. They are a healthy snack food, although they are difficult to eat without plenty of liquids (they kinda congeal/clump in mouth, making it hard to swallow). That having been said, they are simply overpriced. If you have a dehydrator tray or some ingenuity, you can save 90% (a pound of organic flax is about 2$). I prefer the Foods Alive brand instead, if one absolutely must buy pre-made flax crackers (Their mexican flavored are very good, and do not contain liquid aminos (soy), like this brand does, for those who avoid it)",0
"The batter seems to require more moisture than the instructions call for and they don't give a baking time, but 4 minutes seems to work about right. The waffles taste more like regular waffles than Belgian Waffles. I was hoping they would have a more ""malty"" flavor.",0
"While I like my coffee strong, I am slightly susceptible to acidic coffee - just not enough to have to seek out alternatives. If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee. It's good enough to compete with the pre-ground mass-market coffees but doesn't match up to the more premium beans. It has a mild, nuttier flavor than I'm used to, and a hint of aftertaste comparable to a diet beverage.<br /><br />What confuses me is that the description claims this is a good choice for decaf drinkers looking for a more robust flavor. I'm not sure I agree with that, but what confuses me is: is this decaf or not? I didn't think so, but this claim makes it vague.<br /><br />20 minute later update: oops, definitely caffeinated... gotta run!",0
"4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips were<br />blew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise,<br />the chips are good to eat and very salty.",0
I love this soy milk. It tastes not as great when it's not cold so I wouldn't drink it straight away when it comes in the mail but it ships very fast and it's much easier than carrying it from the store and a little cheaper also. And the panda's super cute. I have to admit that this is the reason I originally tried this product at wholefoods.,0
"These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.",0
"this product is easy to fix and tastes really good if you eat it the same day.  it seems to dry out easily if kept longer, even if refrigerated.",0
"With a significant population of recent immigrants from India in the Silicon Valley came a welcome increase in the number of authentic Indian restaurants. San Franciscan's have always enjoyed a diverse bounty of culinary experiences and it's always a challenge to replicate the great recipes at home. I was hoping this product would accomplish that. while quite flavorful, the overall taste is burdened with way too much salt (not authentic proportion) so, like the other 3 star reviewer, I added one half can of coconut milk. The result was an improvement (if not anymore authentic) and tasted more like Thai Curry which I enjoy also. It's a shame that the saltiness dominates what could be a much better product. I even used unsalted butter and still found the saltiness overwhelming.",0
"I've tried three flavors of Mio Liquid and really like the product, but I don't think this flavor is very good.<br /><br />The bottle works very well and is unlikely to accidentally leak.  My routine is to fill the glass halfway, squirt, and then finish filling, at which point the drink is self-mixed.  Unlike powders, there's no residue in the glass, making these particularly convenient for flavoring water in a canteen of some kind.<br /><br />This flavor didn't work for me.  I don't mind the sucralose (aka splenda) and acesulfame k sweetener, and personally do not detect any unpleasant aftertaste (though you may disagree), but the ratio of sweet to tea is tipped too far over on the sweet side.  You can barely taste anything but sweet.<br /><br />However, if you like your tea that way, this is a good value when compared to alternative soft drinks.",0
"Americolor works great.  Unfortunately it's taking more than 2 weeks to get to my house...after my twins 2nd birthday party.  I had to drive across town to buy another set of these colors to do my kids birthday cakes.  Oh well.  I ordered on July 1st.  It's July 16th, and they still haven't arrived yet.  Also, the local shop sold the .75 oz bottles for $1.95.",0
"I think this'll be the last time I try one of these things.  Even for cheap alternatives to help stretch a food budget, they're really just not very good.<br /><br />You already know what to do when you open the box- cook meat, heat water, add rice and flavoring... I mean, seasoning... then top it off with the supplied broccoli...  Wait- broccoli?  What broccoli?  The fact that the packet containing the veggies was no bigger than the one containing the seasoning was a big hint.  Someone else called it 'broccoli dust' and they're quite right!  It looked more like parsley flakes than anything and was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, I guess.  Tasted like chicken and cheese with the barest hint of... I dunno, vegetable flavor.  But I can at least say this one was better than the Cheese-n-Mac concoction I tried last time.",0
"I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite! I can eat it a whole pint at a time. The chocolate Peanut Butter is ""OK"", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste. I couldn't tell there was really any peanut butter flavor at all. The Vanilla and Strawberry Banana I can't even eat on their own. I've used them in a smoothie to save ice cream calories, but don't think they are worth the extra expense. So, I've stopped buying anything but the Chocolate flavor, which I re-order every few months. I've also tried the Pumpkin Spice flavor, that one bombed too. I just ordered their Chocolate Mint Cookie flavor and can't wait to give it a try! I have high hopes for that one! But if your on the fence of what to buy, try their Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter combo and decided which you like better from there.<br />3 stars, because it doesn't have the ""real"" ice cream texture you would expect, but for the calories it helps me get my ice cream fix!  And the Chocolate flavor is better.<br /><br />P.S. sometimes there are occasional problems with some of the pints arriving a little soft and melted. After sticking them in the frezzer to re-freeze, when you go to eat them they can have an icy texture. This is unfortunate, because of how expensive they are. I don't want a single bit to go to waste! But since I can't find them locally, I have been willing to just deal with it.",0
"This coffee is a bit too bold for me, although drinkable.  I also tried that Nantucket Blend, like that and will definitely buy that one again,  I am happy that I received a sample collection of many coffee blands, it helps me choose the blends I like.",0
"I love laces and these were very fresh with great texture.  The dissapointment I had was the flavor.  They were very artificial strawberry flavored.  I think I like cherry much better.  If you like strawberry candy, you will love these!",0

"I like Almond Nut Thins very much, especially the Cheddar Cheese flavor. These ranch-flavored crackers taste good upon first bite, but the problem is that the tangy taste doesn't go away, so if you munch on a few of these in the evening, you will still taste them the next morning - and that's after brushing your teeth and tongue!  Blue Diamond, if you are reading this, please modify the ingredients so that these crackers don't contribute to embarrassing bad breath.  I found myself having to stand back from people and I felt uncomfortable. My husband also experienced the same lingering taste in his mouth. Other than that, they are perfectly crunchy and enjoyable to eat.  I purchased them through Subscribe & Save.  I am going to try out another flavor.  None of the other flavors have had the same longterm effect on me.<br />I have a cupboard full of these crackers.  I'll just have to give some away.  The other complaint/observation is that these rice crackers have no fiber content whatsoever.  For that reason, I may look for another alternative.<br />Update:  Turns out that these crackers don't go over well with my teenage daughter and her friends - too much ""after breath""!  Blue Diamond, if you are listening, you may want to re-vamp your recipe.",0
I have bought enjoy timothy's coffee so orderd the pumpkin spice figured could not go wrong with the brand.  It does smell great but to me it taste a bit weird- and i love pumpkin cooked or any which way.  Do not think i will buy this again.,0
"Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that.",0
This tea is okay but the pomegranate flavor will be only tasted at the first sip and then pfff  gone ! i like mine more pronounced. i was disappointed. sorry !,0
The texture of this is pretty tough.  Tough to chew.,0
Product has correct aroma and taste but lacks proper cook-time to be tender. I prefer the now discontinued DROMEDARY brand from Moody Dunbar. I'll either have to cook them some more or just give them away. From a 58 year pimento user.,0
"I only got a 5 oz. packet of these (~20 of their 6 in. sticks) and gave them out to the crew at home, so it was a small sample...but we all agreed on the following pluses and minuses:<br />+ healthy ingredients...what you'd expect from Newman's Own...especially when compared to the commercial versions<br />+ nice color, obtained naturally...NO food dye!<br />- a bit too waxy for our tastes (as compared to other licorices, like ""Panda"" Brand)<br />- a bit chewy for our teeth...not very filling-friendly<br />So, overall, we have a mediocre response to these. If you really love swizzler-type candy, these might be a healthy alternative...but if you are craving a meatier kind of licorice, try some of the other brands (one example already cited above).<br />Thanks for reading!",0
"I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.",0
"This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.<br /><br />Edited for grammar's sake.",0
I enjoyed this coffe quite a bit but I can not say I enjoyed it any more than any other good quality K-cup coffees available at a much lower price. Doesn't seem to taste the same as in-store brewed.,0
"I purchased these as a treat for myself, I love the Hachez chocolate. I was a little disappointed with the selection of the chocolates, there was not a lot of variety in such a large box, there were too many with the same fillings. I was expecting the usual chocolate varieties as in the Hachez rose box but these were more of the little chocolate cups with fillings and pralines. Overall still great tasting chocolate, but if the description stated more of what the fillings were I may have not purchaed this box.",0
"Nice kit and fermenation went well and the wine finished nice and dry, but it has not so subtle anise charater that is not suited to a patio white wine. Not sure if this is a charaterisic of this appellation or what, but I will order the New Zealand kit next time. I keg, rather than bottle, the wine so I have the flexibility of pouring one glass or one liter and it does mix nicely, so I see a lot of sangrias this summer.",0
"We gave Organic milk a try due to a sale price at the time, but found out that it does not taste that well to us for some reason. We went back with Horizon milk.",0
"I saw a TV segment wherein a chef specified the use of ""Japanese mayonnaise"" in a recipe, so I Googled it and found it on Amazon.  It comes in a very soft, pliable, plastic container, kind of floppy (Phthalates???).  It isn't much different than American Mayonnaise but does differ in a couple of areas.  It is a bit more tart and tastes more ""egg'y"" to me.  It says it's made with ""vegetable oil"".  Not sure what that is comprised of, possibly all or part soy, which is something I am trying to stay away from since, if it's not organic, is genetically engineered (GMO).  If the phthalates and the GMO aspect are not an issue with you, go ahead and try it.",0
"I was looking for Russian Caravan tea, so tried this out. It's fine, drinkable, but just a bit too light for my taste. I may either need to brew it longer to get the flavor to set in more (but that usually just makes a black tea more bitter) or use more (again, bitter). Maybe it just doesn't stand up to milk well, but the one's I've had in the past did much better w/ milk.",0
"Many of my friends love this, which is lucky for me because I foolishly ordered the 6 pack. The price was so much better buying 6 and I was sure I'd love anything chocolate (I always have). The 3 star rating is because of the friends who like it--for me it would have been a 1 because I really don't enjoy the taste of carob and that's what I smell and taste in this drink. I didn't want to say anything negative about this, it's a fine product as long as you like carob, but thought it would be a good idea to warn people in case you're thinking of ordering 6 of them and you don't care for carob.",0
"I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I won't buy them again.",0
"My husband and children, for some reason or other, HATE the taste of regular water so I'm always looking for a way to make the water taste different. We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUHG"">MIO Strawberry Watermelon, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again.",0
"If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.  I would recommend the Peach Black Tea by Stash instead.",0
"My baby has been using this formula for months and it worked great. However, I noticed the last shipment the formula had changed. It bubbles much more, and my baby got constipation almost constantly. I am going to have switch.",0
"I took a risk buying this without knowing how it taste, well its not as good as regular applesauce. I would suggest you get original if you want to buy in bulk.<br /><br />Package review: There were a lot of busted cups, I paid for busted cups.",0
"Our pups ate these, although they weren't entirely enthusiastic about them at first, but I wouldn't deduct points for that necessarily.  What I am concerned about is after I gave them each a chew, I noticed on the bag that these aren't suitable for dogs under 9 months.  I didn't see this mentioned on the product page, and I emailed the company to find out why (is it an issue with a certain ingredient, digestibility, etc.), but have yet to receive a response.  I have two 7.5 month, 50+ lb dogs, so I'm not too worried about the issue, but I'd like to get an answer before I give them more.  This note should be on the product page, as well as in larger print on the package (it's only listed in the fine print on the back) if it's necessary to note in the first place.",0
"This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG brand and never had a problem. Other toys as well. This one didn't last 30 minutes in their presence though.<br /><br />It is a good idea for smaller dogs.",0
"The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good ""well being"" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.",0
"In general, I love Coffee People coffee. My only beef with them in general is that I often get coffee grounds in my brewed coffee, and I don't usually have this happen with other brands of K-cups. But it's usually not many; only one or two. My other problem with this particular order was that one of the K-cups was punctured, so my package arrived covered in coffee grounds. But Amazon was very kind about it, and shipped me a replacement quickly. Other than that, though, this is tasty, strong coffee. I just wish they'd put it on Subscribe & Save.",0
"After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried ""roasting"" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a ""chocolaty and vanilla"" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..!",0
I've been waiting over a month for this to be shipped!  I really like Emeril's Jazzed Up regular coffee and want a decaf version.,0
"I selected these to feed to my cats.  Because amazon didn't list the ingredients I had little to go on.  I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried ""raw"" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of ""treats"" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These ""bites"" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br /><br />The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br /><br />Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the box:<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.  There is evidence that inulin may not be safe for the digestive system.  It's safety is questionable.  I avoid it.), Sage, Clove.",0
"it was ok.  Just ok.  Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  I went to drink it hoping for it to be just like dr pepper.  At first I felt like it was lacking in sweetness, but that was just because stevia lacks that mouthfeel of sugar.  I adjusted to the sweetness thing by the second gulp and that was ok.  It was actually pretty ok except for the lacking bite.  I got the stevia aftertaste (not too bad of one) where I was expecting bite.  Disappointing... not dismal... I got the variety pack... This was the first one I tried.  I'm likely to drink the other one... but its just not the same.  I actually looked back at the can a few times to convince myself it said Dr. Zevia and not Cola... It is passable as a cola (haven't tried the cola yet).  Hopefully the other flavors will be better.",0
"It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it.",0
"The title says it all, the flavor is just ok, no real OOOOO factor.<br />It doesn't really taste like creme brulee, for those who know that that tastes like.<br />It's kind of caramel-ish with a burnt aftertaste, not my favorite.<br />We're stuck with a whole extra box that we'll probably only drink when we're desperate.<br />If you want a GREAT cup of dessert coffee go with Timothy's German Chocolate Cake, you wont be disappointed!",0
"Bought a case of this soup because my kids eat a lot of Tomato soup.  Should have checked price at the local grocery store first, as it was much more economical.",0
I somewhat enjoyed the MIO Mango Peach flavoring for water.  It adds a little flavor to water and is easy to use.  My only complaint is that is has a bit of an aftertaste like many calorie free drinks have.  I didn't care for that.  I will definitely drink what I received from Amazon Vine but am not sure I would buy more on my own.  I have to think about that.,0
"The Candy is ok, it not as great what I thought.<br /><br />Just taste like big cherry jelly beans, only reason that I ordered them for they were at a wedding show that I attended and said that I should order the cheaper bulk price at Amazon.",0
"All dried apples I've found (tried many brands) have problems - bits of core, various debris, brown spots, etc...<br /><br />These aren't perfect, but they are the best I've found.  Big juicy pieces with not too much debris and brown spots.",0
"I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, ""Flavored mayonnaise"".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, ""Yo no quiero Taco Bell"".<br /><br />Not recommended.",0
"These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!",0
"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much.",0
"This product tastes okay, but is definitely quite sweet.  Maybe I missed something, but I couldn't find the calorie content prior to ordering and foolishly ordered any way.  One review I read said there is 60 calories, but it is 80 calories a cup per the packaging, I probably wouldn't have ordered.  This will be a one time per day drink...also has a bad aftertaste.  On a positive note, the pricing is reasonable...however with one a day, it is going to take me two months to go through this drink that I am not crazy about.",0
"I am disappointed in this product.  I had expected something with more flavor considering the description note: ""its hearty and rich full flavor.""<br /><br />I prepare several dishes with Guinness Stout and even a small amount will produce a flavor that is unmistakable.  The amount of stout in this recipe must be a small fraction because I could not detect it at all and certainly no hint of Worcestershire Sauce, which usually makes its presence known in dishes such as this.<br /><br />For me it was much too bland and had a ""pasty"" flavor I associate with undercooked wheat flour thickening.",0
"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.",0
"I originally tried this product because the ""oil-free"" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it.

I was also hoping for raspberry chunks but this uses raspberry powder. These bars are definitely an acquired taste but they aren't any worse than the ""traditional energy bars"" and I still do like that they have wholesome ingredients instead of all the funky stuff. I do like that these don't leave me with a bloated heavy feeling but they are satisfying. I will be using these as a meal replacement instead of the energy bars that need not be named.",0
"the salt is wet and i dont like that. it's not dripping or anything, but it's moist and it is clumping. i had to put it in the oven and as i type it's baking to get the moisture out.<br /><br />i did not know that it would be damp.<br /><br />it has a nice flavor, quite salty. if it was not damp/wet, i'd buy it again.",0
Tea was very good with a mild hint of mango.  Rather expensive compared to other brands.  Also made iced tea with the tea bags and it was very refreshing.  The Passionfruit with the Mango is a great combination,0
"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.",0
"The service was excellent from Amazon,it always is. I compare other companies to Amazon.  Amazon has set the level of customer service, and quickness to such a high level, extremely hard to beat. Nine out of ten times I always shop at Amazon not only are they quicker, but they also have everything for less expensive price. No shipping if you sign up for prime time once a year.Love them can you tell  !!!!As far as the coffee I preferred Green Mountain my choice, over Gloria Jeans Hazelnut.",0
"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!",0
"Couldn't give these more than three stars. The smell turned me off. Smelt like old ketchup. Hard to explain. The texture was good, and the expiration date is well into 2012. Not something I really look forward to eating, but the flavor is ok. Just expected something different. If you have issues with smells, then you might not like these. Wished I had bought the Buffalo flavor. Won't repeat buy on the ketchup flavor.",0
"This was listed as 14 oz packages. It really is 12 oz. Beware. This has been slowly disappearing from the shelves around my part of the country, I thought I would grab these up. And since they were advertising this as 14 oz, I trusted that they would be that size. So, product - 5 stars. Advertising - 1 star.",0
"Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that.",0
"These are fairly decent little cookies! A good crunch, a good flavor, not too much 'sugar-free' or 'protein' aftertaste. I dip them in peanut butter or crumble them up to use in baking or on yogurt. A solid low-carb snack.",0
"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!",0
"I really like these mints, and carry them with me all the time.  My husband suggested that I check with Amazon, to see if I could get a better deal on Amazon, than I do at the grocery store.  When we read the description, it appeared to us, as though it meant 96 actual packages (individual things of mints).  What the 96 refers to, is that you get 96 individual mints.  That certainly changes the price a bit!  This price is much more expensive than if I were to buy them in the store.  The pack of 5 in the store, is $2.99, and this comes out to something like $3.78 for 5 packages.  Oh well.",0
"There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.",0
"Strawberry Zevia is good, but you can't really rate a flavor when it's so either/or. It's not my favorite, it has a bit of a sting to it but it's right on the line where it's tough to say it's either good or bad. For those who are more a fan of the tart fruity flavors, then you may like this flavor a lot.",0
"While these chips taste good, there was no olive flavor in them whatsoever. You can even see the real olives in each piece, but the added olive did not add anything to the flavor. All I could taste were plain tortilla chips that didn't taste much different than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011VYFWQ"">Tostitos</a>. I just think if it's olive flavored, it should taste like olives.",0
"Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags.

"I did like the selection of coffee so I could sample a large assortment without buying a large box and being stuck with somethign I don't like.  However, negative - out of 35 cups, 11 were decaf.  That's 1/3!  I don't drink decaf...who does anyways?  I drink coffee to WAKE UP.  Will not purchase again, and do not recommend.",0
"product is awesome, but if your paying more than $10 for a 10 pack of this your getting ripped off",0
Serving size is a bit small. Fits in a 6 ounce tea cup.<br /><br />It is really good though. Tastes like regular miso except much less spicy.,0
"These cookies may be ""wheat free"", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients. Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.",0
The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking....,0
"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.",0
"I thought this drink had a well balanced flavor.  I preferred it over the Caffe blend that I had previously tried.  I drank it cold and it was enjoyable.  No fireworks of the taste buds or immediate desire for more. But, it tasted okay.<br /><br />Final impression based on my one-can taste test: Just okay.  I may or may not buy one if I was in the mood for a cold coffee drink at a convenience or drug store.",0
"These hard ""carmels"" have a good flavor but  dont really taste like carmel to me, more of a honey taste than a carmel.<br />The flavor is good, but not really what I was expecting!<br />I also did not notice any extra energy from eating one.<br />I would have given these a 4 star if they tasted more like carmel or if I noticed extra energy from eating one.<br />Over all these are good but dont expect these to be like any other carmel you probably have had  and dont expect to get a burst of energy!",0
"I've tried both the pomegranate and the blackberry. Of the two, I prefer the pomegranate.<br /><br />I don't mind that is only 70% juice, that seems fine and they seem sweet enough. But, unlike the 100% sparkling grape juice I have had in the past, these two Izze flavors leave my mouth feeling somewhat dry...in a way I have not experienced with other drinks. These 8.4 fl.oz. cans contain Izze Fortified which means fortified with 10% of the USRDA of Vitamin C, Vitamin 6 and Niacin. It appears from the Izze web site that Izze in 12 oz bottles is not fortified so I might one day want to try the non-fortified Izze and see what that is like.<br /><br />However, the 100% sparkling grape juice I can buy locally, although it comes in a much larger bottle so may not be as convenient, seems more economical so, if I wanted a sparking juice, I'd probably buy that instead. Or I might sometimes, but not often, want a sparkling water. But usually I am more than content with tap water. If I want fruit, I can alway eat fruit.",0
"The box was packaged nicely, not mixed up like other people have commented, and I was really excited for this. I watched the package's tracking info like a hawk. Anyway when i opened it up it looked normal but they were all stale, so I gave them to my little cousins who usually love jelly beans, but they threw them at me in disgust. How do I complain to amazon? Everyone has tasted jelly bellies and knows they are great. Its not a matter of quality, I think i just got a bad box. Do i return it? Probably not because tons of jelly beans are missing, the box had been opened, and its a ""food"". What do i do because i am not happy.",0
"I was warned, people said this would not come with a card, but I had never had a bad experience with Amazon so I got it anyway.  It was a surprise to our boss for letting us have some days off for vacation, so naturally we were not here when it arrived.  Since there was no card he assumed that it came from one of our vendors to thank us for doing business with them and the basket was divided up amongst the office.<br /><br />We did not want anyone to feel bad, so we did not reveal that it was from us, but I am a little sad and disappointed that he does not know how much we appreciated him letting us go.",0
"Love the six-pack .... but not all the flavors.<br />Would love to be able to pick the ones I wanted.<br />Why not give us a choice of all the available flavors?<br />My favorites are the caramel, hazelnut, and vanilla.<br />I wouldn't mind getting two of each of those on the next order.<br />Is this possible?",0
"Hi,<br /><br />My cat Denver liked and didn't like the Merrick Gourmet food.  But I'm glad I went to Amazon, because the price was much better than anywhere else.<br />Thanks for being there and I know I will be shopping at Amazon again in the near future.<br /><br />Deborah Tinsley",0
"...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.",0
"Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%).",0
"I bought this as a gift to someone I know loves pepper. I hoped this would be a extra special set of peppercorn sample. However, there didn't seem to be anything special about these from my mixed peppercorns that are in a usual multicolored mix. These are just separate from each other. Nothing wrong with them just not worth the extra money",0
"I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.",0
"Recently ordered some Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-cups and found the coffee to be only okay, not great.  There is very little hazelnut flavor and the coffee is on the bitter side.  Will finish this order but will not re-order this brand.",0

"Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless.",0
"I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is ""healthier"" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.",0
"My 1 year old Weimaraner loves the the taste of the treat; however, they do leave a lot of little crumbs everywhere....I usually have to vacuum up the crumbs daily....Aside from that the dog does enjoy them and do last a decent amount of time - just wish they weren't so messy....",0

"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.",0
"This is good hurricane relief food, a part of everyone's emergency stash. Trouble is we haven't had enough hurricanes where I live to do a subscription, but I subscribed to monthly deliveries, anyway.<br /><br />Why? The stew is decent when doctored, that's why. With 4-5 cans, you add a stalk of celery, 2-4 carrots (depending on size), an onion, and some other vegetable. Add one smallish potato per can (keep the skins), cubed. Cook the vegetables in red wine and a little water. Mix in bay leaves, and Herbes de Provence. Add pepper to taste. Add the stew when the vegetables look done, and heat through.<br /><br />What you don't do is add salt. There's plenty of that in the stew, already.",0
"I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.",0
"good, but not as good as the older version of the syrup (white chocolate) they had in the glass bottle; smaller size, less flavorful. Nice to have it in a multipack though.",0
"I will start by noting that I am a long time fan of Patak's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB1AXG"">Patak's Mixed Relish, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> with their mixed pickle among my favorite things; (an understatement, I would almost call it an addiction  BUT *the* store which carries it locally has almost tripled the price, so I turned to Amazon... hoping, but, alas, they will not ship to Hawaii.<br /><br />I have found quite a few things here which are as good as, some even better than, my old ""tried and true"" and so I gave the MTR pickle a try.  The price is exceptional.  No complaints in that department, but I personally found this pickle a bit too salty.  The consistency is also different, not as chunky.<br /><br />Now these things are a matter of personal taste, likely more so with respect to food than anything else I can think of.  It is also a bit of a challenge to describe, particularly if you do not know, or necessarily share someone's personal taste.<br /><br />This is not a bad product and I can imagine a lot of people liking it more than I.  Any pickle is going to have a good deal of salt because... that's what a pickle is: something preserved in salt.  I tend to go lower on salt than most.  That said, if you like salty foods, you will like this better than I did.  I also prefer a chunkier consistency.  This pickle approaches a spread.  Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing, more a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I like the spice blend in Patak's better as well, and this is the most difficult to describe as it is subtle and noone wants to detail their recipe(and I can not think of a single ingredient which stands out).  So, all I can say is that I did not like it as much<br /><br />The MTR pickle is also not as hot, and I personally like HOT.  This is a place where many people will not share my personal preference, as I know from experience that I eat food hotter than the vast majority of people (It was years before my husband could eat curries as hot as I tend to order or prepare them).<br />As Indian pickles go, in my experience, this is on the milder side.  Judging by the reviews I have read of several products here, *most* people will differ from my tastes in this area and probably prefer a relatively milder pickle.<br /><br />All that said, this is a condiment which one would add to bring up the heat in a dish, maybe make it a little more flavorful.  I frequently have Annies frozen entrees for lunch (quick, convenient and healthy); the ones available locally being the spinach and paneer, and one or 2 bean curries with rice.  i find them fairly bland and *always* add pickle (I think without the pickle I would not enjoy them, maybe not eat them at all!).  I think the MTR mixed pickle will work OK to spice up those bland dishes.  It is not something I am going to either throw or give away, however, it is also not something I would order again.<br /><br />I hope I have been able to provide a description which is adequate enough for people to decide whether or not this would be to their taste.  In sum, I found this pickle to be saltier and milder than what I am used to.  It also has a different consistency than most, being somewhat smoother and less chunky.  Again, none of these things is necessarily bad.  It is all a matter of personal taste.<br />Edited to note that by the time we got to the bottom of the first jar I had sussed out the ingredient which threw the taste, and my opinion off.  The ""heat"" is provided by paprika, rather than chile (which is what most or all of the other brands I have had use).  Paprika is nowhere near as hot a cayenne, or chile, and so much more is required to make this hot.  Ultimately it is not as hot, and the other flavors are somewhat diminished (because of the quantity of parika required).  if you like paprika you may like this, and if you don't, get another brand.",0
I sent this to my sick mother whom I don't live close enough to take care of and I was disappointed.  There were several items that were substituted and not substituted equally for what you are expecting.  The description makes it sound much nicer than it actually is.,0
If you have not had these before I'd suggest buying one before buying a huge pack of them. They are hard and I have to put mine in the micro for a few seconds so I can bite into it. The calories are also a little higher than id prefer. all in all they are just ok.,0
"I purchased this due to the great reviews which usually does me well.  However, compared to other flavored K-cups (i.e. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake), this lacks flavor & sweet notes and tastes burnt.  I would not order this coffee again, and will likely stay away from Gloria Jean's in general.",0
"My cat cannot get enough of this food - so it must taste great.<br /><br />With this as her regular diet, she gained 3lbs in a year; my vet said this is a fattening food.  I still give her individual pieces of kibble as ""treats"" but I feed her Blue Buffalo weight control now.",0
"I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.",0
It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner,0

"When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.",0
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.,0
This food is great but you can get it cheaper at your local chain pet store or even at their website.,0

"If you love ""sour green apple"" candy, like the classic Jolly Rancher apple flavor, this is the best bet for the same flavor in liquid format. Mixed with enough ice to make it freezing cold and slightly weaker, it's refreshing. The ""mocktail"" marketing gimmick is really just a gimmick: cute packaging that puts you in the mindset of a more adult-oriented flavor. But it really is just candy green apple kool-aid. Whether you see that as a positive or negative recommendation is according to your personal taste.",0
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.,0
"I don't know if its the corn, but this sweet potato is runny.  The other ones from Gerber with sweet potato's are not.  I prefer the solid food to be thicker.",0

"Medium to Dark, but not really a ""bold"" strength<br />Not too acidic.<br />OK flavor.<br /><br />I really didn't see any difference between this coffee and Folgers, Maxwell House or similar brand.  This Community Dark Roast did not impress me enough to want to purchase it again.",0
"Nectresse is definitely a viable alternative to sugar and other artificial sweeteners. The only thing I didn't like was the fruity after taste, which is understandable since it's made from monk fruit. However, I fear that the fruity after taste might conflict with whatever you happen to sprinkle it on. I probably wouldn't purchase this in the future, but for those who are looking for a healthier sugar alternative, this might be worth a try.",0
Good flavor the medaallions are a little tougher than I prefer. They were packed well and arived timely. Good deal for the price.,0
"not as good as i expected from the ratings on here. they are not sweet at all & kind of too tart but has over 20 grams of sugar in 1 bar???  but they are made with raw, healthy ingredients so i will eat them. maybe i'll try another flavor next time.",0
"I put this in smoothies for my older kids (my sons lift weights and run), but they complain about the aftertaste (It helps if I use less).  They don't seem to notice when I add it to low fat muffins or to pancakes.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product, but will likely look for something with less taste.",0
Really great tasting chips. I really did not expect them to be as hard as they were. Good if they are cover with a cheese sauce.,0
"As the title says, these wasabi gumballs were reaaally gross tasting. I tried one and only got through 5 or 6 chews before I had to spit it out.<br /><br />I got them as a stocking stuffer for Xmas and it was fun receiving them and I was excited to try them as I like trying unusual foods, etc. It was also fun getting my fiance to try one, knowing how gross they were and knowing that he had an even lower tolerance for gross tastes, hahah. After that I threw the rest out because I knew no one would eat them.<br /><br />So I agree with the previous reviewers who say this is great for a gag gift, but bad if you are seriously looking to buy for gum to chew.",0
"The Amazon page mentions that this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea with Passion Fruit has pulp. That is a major understatement. By pulp, they mean chunks of passion fruit up to ¾ of an inch. The few people that saw the drink before I opened it insisted that there was something wrong with it and I should throw it away. I was pretty disgusted too but committed to trying it. I didn't think there was any way that I would like it.<br /><br />It turned out to taste pretty good. The experience with the oversized ""pulp"" wasn't bad either. I found it natural to swallow the liquid and the lumps separately but it was fine.<br /><br />There are two reasons that I don't expect to get this again. It is expensive and it is too sweet. It is sweet enough to be a dessert.  It was a novelty to try it once. I liked it, but I'm all set now.",0
"It's a good feeding mechanism for my dog who scarfs food, but as far as a toy that challenges her, it's a cakewalk.  It's a great start for Kyjen to start marketing to people that love Nina Ottoson but don't want/can't spend $40 on one toy.  I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.",0
"Intended to make baby's food, thought I would just use my steamer basket and food processor but got this for Xmas and use it daily. I've steamed and pureed fruit, veg, meat, fish, grain and used it to reheat. I like that you just set it to steam and walk away (you have a baby after all). It's generally easy to use and clean. Complaints about big batches are funny because I can't do SMALL enough batches! I like to make just one or two servings to eat that day. I don't want to serve frozen food all the time or the same food day after day. Babycook does not blend small batches, I have to mash by hand! This is exactly what such a tiny appliance should do!<br /><br />There are also design issues, not how it looks (it is cute) but how it works (it is finicky). The spatula and mixing lid are awkward extra pieces to keep track of and clean. The mixing lid is useless. When removing the lid to stir there are two messy lids to remove, set down on the counter and clean, etc. It works just fine without it. The spatula is not great at scraping the bowl and if it is only intended to lift a hot basket, this could be solved more intelligently. Teardrop lid handles are slippery and difficult to grasp. Blades are not easily removable.",0
Nothing special about this item. Tastes fairly bland. It is not bad but just not anything special and not worthy of buying again.,0
"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.",0
"I had actually had one or two of these cookies at a picnic a few weeks back. I was fairly impressed at how good they were and was eager to try them again.  Unfortunately, the pack that I received from Amazon was less than impressive. The cookies themselves were dark, seemingly burned. Half of the pack was broken. And honestly, they just didn't live up to my memory of just a few weeks earlier. I'd be willing to give the cookies one more swing, based on my first exposure.  Because, to be certain, if this pack of Chips Ahoy Gooey were my first go round...  there wouldn't be a second.",0
"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.",0
"I think this is a great idea to make a concentrate because you buy this one small bottle and just add one squirt it to an entire glass of water over and over again for 24 glasses!.  I really thought the flavor is perfect and strong enough with one squirt in each glass.  Any more than that and it is really too strong and too much.  So this really does make 24 servings and I like that it has four B vitimans-40% of earch of these (B5 B6 B3 and B12) , Vitamin C 120% and 10% of both Chromium and Zinc.  I do not love the artificial sweetner taste but if you like punch this is just what you are probably used to. Also it really beats the hastle of buying a case of Vitiman waters and lugging it all over.  No more heavy lifting so you decide!",0
"Your satisfaction with this product will depend on how you eat it. This is not the kind of cereal you pour into a bowl, add milk and eat immediately. Unfortunately, the cereal is very hard; I would not call it crunchy, it's just plain hard.<br /><br />There are two ways around this. I customarily pour this cereal on top of plain yogurt, add milk and let it sit in the fridge overnight. By morning, the cereal is soft but not soggy. Of course it's not crunchy/crispy either but when you eat gluten-free you tolerate a lot. Alternatively, you can add milk or water to the cereal and heat it in the microwave. It's actually good this way, like a form of oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't mind the flavor, but again, I've been eating gluten-free for 3 years and know not to expect too much. I do like the fact that a serving provides 5 grams of fiber (more challenging to get on a gluten-free diet) and is fortified with vitamins and minerals.",0
"I gave my black Lab puppy a large Everlasting Treat Ball as a surprise treat today. He has been enjoying playing with the teething friendly rubbery treat ball a lot, and so far has not been able to chewed it up into pieces that could pose a choking or swallowing health concern, but he made short work removing and eating the two hard chicken flavor treat caps that seal into the rubber ball. The Foster and Smith brand beef and barley meat ball treats I put inside the treat opening in the rubber ball middle for added play fun and enticement have proved more difficult and entertaining for him to remove so far than the hard treat caps I had hoped would last longer as they where designed to do ideally. I think the Everlasting Treat Ball has value for doggie chew needs and entertainment, but so do many other less expensive doggie toy/treat options that don't require special refills, or pricey initial investments in.",0
"I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber ""tug"" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.",0
"For those who've tried it, does it remind you of anything?<br /><br />To me, this tastes just like strawberry-flavored toothpaste that I had as a kid. It's rather unappealing, you feel like you shouldn't even swallow the gum juices because it's like swallowing toothpaste. The smell is deceiving, it's more accurate compared to a true strawberry. The texture is a little tougher than other Orbit gums to begin, then gets softer than usual and stays that way for a long time. It's not a bad gum, per se, but Sweet Mint, Spearmint, or even Sangria Fresca are a better bet.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish there was no aspartame or other gook in Orbit gum. The reason I chew Orbit is it seems to be a mainstream gum that has less coloring / artificial sweeteners than other gums. The coloring / aspartame, etc. are less than 2% of ingredients, while sorbitol is the main ingredient. I hope they will decide to phase out the unnecessary parts. I really couldn't care if the color of the gum matches the fruit flavor advertised as long as it tastes right.

"I was excited to try these once I got a whiff of the contents upon opening the package.  I'm a fan of good licorice...note: Twizzlers are just okay to me.<br /><br />The smell and consistency of this licorice are good, but the flaver is quite disappointing.  It has a very weak taste of Pomegranate and for some reason I got a hint of peppermint in every bite.  Maybe just the way my taste buds interpreted the licorice mixed with a little pomegranate juice (can't be much in there).<br /><br />I like these more than Twizzlers, but I would buy a number of other brands before these.<br /><br />FYI: Below are the listed ingredients and nutrition facts.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />-----------<br />Organic Wheat Flour<br />Organic Sugar<br />Corn Syrup<br />Organic Tapioca Syrup<br />Vegetable Glycerin<br />Sunflower Oil<br />Elderberry Extract<br />Citric Acid<br />Natural Flavor<br />Pomegranate Juice Concentrate<br />Licorice Root Extract<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />---------------<br />Servings per container: About 3.5<br />Calories per serving: 130<br />Total Fat 0.5g<br />Sodium 5mg<br />Total Carbs 32g<br />- Dietary Fiver 2g<br />- Sugars 10g<br />Protein 2g",0
"I got a sample of this in my Influenster Summer VoxBox and I thought that it was ok. This bar should definitely be microwaved! It tastes way better warm, than it does when it is cold.

"I just tried this flavor. Clear and cold with just a trace of flavoring and not too sweet - adult taste, not a kiddie juice drink. There is no strong coconut flavor or aroma.<br /><br />Zico makes a great novelty mixer (vodka & bourbon too) but seems a bit pricey for daily use.",0
I found this shampoo to be nice but nothing exceptional.  I like the clean smell and it does rinse out clean but the increase in volume wasn't anything to run home about.  I would buy this just for the fact it does rinse clean and doesn't leave any residue behind!,0
"I was sceptical about this product because it tastes like no other unsweetened cranberry juice I've ever tried. Its syrupy, sweeter than other cranberry juices and has a grape juice taste to it. I contacted Dynamic Health and they say its 100% cranberry juice. I still feel a bit sceptical though. I'm used to Tree of Life brand so I think I'll just go back to it.",0
"I bought a case and drank one every afternoon at work. I am not sure if it was the placebo effect, but it seemed to give me a little afternoon lift whereas I would normally be dragging. The taste is probably not for everyone. I gave one to a coworker and she gagged. I drink it over lots of ice and find it to be tasty, albeit probably an acquired taste. In any event, it was too expensive to drink every day so I stopped. Might pick up another case in the future.",0

Still for the price here on subscribe and save it comes out pretty reasonable. I can still remember when I was younger, that this sauce was imported from Italy. Not anymore. So, if you can doctor it up a bit with your own fresh spices, this is not bad as a base for your pasta sauce.",0

I love Pamela's products. This product is awesome as so is all her products. I just ordered Pamela's baking mix and bread mix  the other day and it just showed up yesterday and all 6 bags in two separate boxes had two small puncture holes in all the bags in the same spot. The holes had to have been made at Pamela's packaging warehouse because they were packaged in Pamela's shipping boxes. I called amazon and reported it to them and they were very nice and refunded my money.I would have given this product a five star but for the packaging issue from Pamela's i gave it three stars.,0

"I've had a great many types of vegetarian meat alternatives from all over the world. Though these have soy  protein as well, they still have a bit of that rubbery texture/mouth feel that seitan ""wheat meat"" has. The price is for a very large can with quite a bit of product, so I thought that it was competitively priced with other similar products. I emptied the can and froze it for using what I need at a time, which has worked out well. It thaws perfectly. I don't think I will order again unless I need a shelf stable hydrated product. There are better tasting/textured options, including any of the Quorn chick'n tenders available with frozen foods.",0

"I am a big fan of home made cookies, particularly chocolate and oatmeal cookies. I also will eat an occasional Chips Ahoy cookie. The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond is okay but I would likely never buy them. The taste is not as good as the homemade or Chips Ahoy and I not fond of the texture as well. They are a bit bland and not that soft. They are also filled with the usual large list of chemicals found in most commercial products of this type. I realize they must be preserved to last for months and must retain their softer texture through artificial means. I will likely finish the box I have, but cannot really recommend them.",0

If I pop it any longer than 1:35, I start getting burned popcorn. Still looking for popcorn nirvana...",0
"Happy with the coffee! However, it would have been nice if the seller would have posted 28.00 dollars for two pack decaf coffee, instead of 14.00 instead of ""two pack"" in parenthesis.

"I went on a search for mini mochi after getting hooked on them from my local Yolo's.  They have them as a yogurt topping choice and they ARE authentic in taste and texture.  I was a bit worried that when I bought these ""Mochi"" (3 - 2 pound bags!!!) that it wouldn't have that authentic mochi taste.  My fears were realized when I popped them into my mouth and tasted...sweetened flour.  Ok it's not THAT bad if you aren't accustomed to real mochi.  I'll still eat them and and still use them as toppings at home, but I'm a bit disappointed in these and will not buy them again.",0
"I just received my order of these Warheads candy.  They are great quality, and not deformed/melted like a previous order I had made for 120 bagged together.  The main reason I didn't give this 5 stars is simply because of the uneven proportion, and my favorite ones (green) being the least in the container.  I have read a few reviews which mentioned an over-abundance of Yellows in the container.  Although my results weren't nearly as extreme, the numbers still were frustrating when looking for an even mix.  The numbers worked out like this:  94 Red, 80 Yellow, 45 Blue, and only 28 Green.  What's the deal?!?  Now, I don't mind the few extra yellows, as I do like them 2nd best.  Red is my least favorite of the bunch, however with that said, I still like them, and they will be consumed.  If you do the math, there was an extra 7 tossed in the mix, but I'd gladly given them up for a more reasonable proportion.  So do be aware that the big negative is that it's just not consistent on if you will get a good mix or not.  There's only one other thing I'll point out that caught my attention.  Typically when you buy any type of candy in a tub like this, there is a safety plastic ring around the lid.  That was NOT the case when I received mine.  I'm sure it's no big deal, and the count (like I mentioned above) was in my favor.  It just seemed a bit strange to me.  Regardless, if the risk of drastically uneven colors, and that little plastic ring don't bug you, enjoy!  I know I will, however it would have been SO much better with more greens (to me)...",0
"NOT BAD IF YOU DON'T MIND PAYING NEARLY $150 A POUND FOR TUNA!!!  I think they could put five times as much tuna in the giant jar and it shouldn't affect the price a bit because you'd still be paying the equivalent of $30 per pound!<br /><br />The cat loves them though and I guess that's the bottom line.  But they stink!  I made the mistake of touching them to pull them out of the bottle.  I should have just sprinkled them out.  Now my hands smell like tuna!<br /><br />But the cat LOVES them.  And it's so good to see my 16-year-old cat really enjoy something and get so intense about it!  It's like they took 10 years off her life!  She's SO happy today!!<br /><br />WARNING:  One word of warning though... don't put the bottle anywhere where you don't want the cat to go.  The odor is quite strong and it leaks out of the bottle.  In other words, the cat can smell the bottle from a mile away!  Do NOT put it on a shelf, desk or counter if you don't want the cat to go there.  They will do anything in their power to get close to the bottle!!<br /><br />I don't like my cat getting on my desk.  And if I put the bottle on my desk that would instantly become her new favorite place.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing... the cap was impossible to get off the first time.  I had to actually take a knife and cut away at the little tabs that you have to break in order to open it.  But after opening it the first time it's been fine.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I hate the smell and because of the difficulty in getting the top opened initially.  But it's definitely a 5 Star + for the cat!  And that's what counts.",0

"One of the 1 star reviews says there is sucralose and hence metallic? i didn't look at ingredients (i guess i will), but i agree that it doesn't have a good after-taste.<br />I really wanted to like this. I bought it, right? but i think it's just ""meh"". It tastes fake. I made it with milk to make it nice and creamy - consistency is fine; (i blend it in blender with ice).<br />I just finished mine and these few minutes later i still just think ""i don't like it!""<br />Sooo... that's great that there are tons of 5 star reviews, but it's definitely not for the taste. :)<br />blech.<br />ETA - i came back after a week. it's not all THAT bad, it's just not as yummy and creamy as i would like. It seems like a large majority of the 5 star reviews are from weight-loss surgery patients? that might influence them b/c i guess they are limited by what they can have?<br />i will confess i actually look forward to my shake now -but i AM on a diet and i look forward to the caffeine also. I stand by the slightly metalic-y aftertaste. It's probably 3.5 stars. I LOVE My source of life energy shake. that's not chocolate though. that's the kind of drink i give FIVE stars!",0
"Not so impressed with this hummus. Then again, I've not been positively impressed with any canned or bottled hummus I've had. My search continues, but for ""emergency hummus"" to have on hand, choices are slim. I see a business opportunity for someone.<br /><br />Despite the claim of being made in Israel, this hummos reminds me of someone talking in a ""Ja'fakin"" accent. Taste and ingredients don't really add up.<br /><br />Check out the Ja-fakin' ingredients:<br />Chickpeas, tehina, water. Good so far. Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed and/or Soy) [""what what WHAT?""], Dextrose, salt, ""Edible Starch"" (huh?), Citric Acid, and ""spices"".<br /><br />Let's break this down:<br />- No olive oil. They use literally the cheapest edible oil obtainable.<br />- Dextrose. That's potato sugar. What's that in there for?<br />- ""Edible"" starch? I would hope so! Does the fact that it's edible need to be mentioned? Just what kind of starch? And why is it in there? Clearly a thickener, to stretch their ingredients (saves them $ while they charge you a lot). So they can add more water and fewer chickpeas. As if chickpeas are expensive.<br />- Citric Acid. This is to provide the tartness that LEMON JUICE would normally provide in a ""real"" recipe.<br />- ""Spices"". LOL, seriously. They're not keeping any big secrets here! Traditional hummus would call for cumin, and perhaps garlic. Why so vague?<br /><br />Okay, okay. Search for a positive point.<br />Okay: no preservatives. I wouldn't buy a non-perishable hummus with something like sodium benzoate in it. Most of the fresh mass-produced versions do (think the stuff you find in the refrigerated non-frozen section at Costco), and while the fresh variety taste much better, the preservatives really bother me with those.<br /><br />Some might also see as a positive that these cans come with a pull tab and a soft plastic cap to put over the can when you put it in the fridge. I find that wasteful. I now use a Kuhn-Rikon safety can opener, which enables me to put can tops back on, and I also get no sharp edges of the pull tab.<br /><br />To me, Yehuda hummus is noticeably thin. I haven't seen anyone mention this. It will easily run out of the jar if you upend it. By the way, I always open these jars on the bottom, because they're too full to stir (shaking beforehand doesn't help), and getting to eat the thicker hummus first which has settled to the bottom, almost reminds me of eating real hummus &lt;lol>.<br /><br />The taste? Not much taste. The first taste I get is an weird almost peanut buttery flavor (a common ingredient in REALLY fake hummus), though I'm sure it's not and probably has something to do with the kind of tahini they use (I actually have a can of Yehuda tahini too but haven't had the nerve to try it yet). After that, I feel a little tang of the ja-fakin' citric acid. After that, I notice the watery and overly-smooth texture of this hummus. I then notice I don't have much of a chickpea taste. I then feel glad I'm eating hummus at all. I then realize that these cans are too small, and I shouldn't be able to finish a whole one myself in one sitting, even if I do really like hummus and yes I was hungry.<br /><br />I've tried the Wild Garden variety too (in little glass bottles). It was a long time ago, and the ingredients are also ja-fakin, but I think the taste was better, and IIRC it was a little thicker. No preservatives either. Jars are a little bigger than Yehuda cans, and it's cheaper to boot, but not by much. I can't understand why hummus is so expensive, since chickpeas are dirt cheap.<br /><br />Amazon does actually sell a legit bottle hummus in its 'gourmet' section (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J89GR0"">""L'Epicurien Chickpea Cream Hummus""</a>), but it's fantasically expensive for what you get. However, its truly legit ingredients read almost like a recipe book: chickpeas 51%, tahini (sesame paste), extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, lemons, cider vinegar, garlic, concentrated lemon juice, spices (of which cumin is 0.22%). Looks like someone makes it in their kitchen. I told you there were opportunities with this stuff.<br /><br />I also found some canned ""hummos"" in the international section of a grocery store which came from an Arab country, like Lebanon or something. Now THAT stuff was not even passable, unlike Yehuda and Wild Garden, which are passable, just not great. I've even tried dry hummus ""mix"" in desperation, one of those big dry mix names like Fantastic (I don't remember), and that was a disaster, on the lines of my canned Arab hummos, actually worse if that's possible. I do like the Falafel from dry mixes, just not hummus.<br /><br />I've never had a fresh hummus which wasn't better than a non-perishable variety, and that includes the fresh mass-produced stuff at Costco, which is remarkably consistent in flavor and texture, despite them sourcing from different brands. I've also tasted fresh hummus made by a friend, and had hummus in two different restaurants, one a vegan retaurant and another a fancy mediterranean place. So I may not be an expert, but I've been around.<br /><br />My opinion is anyone who thinks this is great hummus, has never had great hummus. Or even ""good"" hummus. You can't have ""great"" hummus made with fake, corner-cutting ingredients.<br /><br />For now I plan to go back to Wild Garden for my ""emergency hummus"" quick fix (yes I keep whole wheat pitas frozen for such occasions!). But I'm still searching! I see Amazon sells a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5HX8"">Manischewitz brand hummus</a>, but as of this writing it's unavailable. Any other alternatives? Leave me a comment.<br /><br />Oh, if you're in doubt, my hummus philosophy is: don't go with those trukey fancied-up kinds (""roasted red pepper"", etc). It's hard to improve on a recipe which is thousands of years old. YMMV. If you're not sure, get the ""traditional"" kind (Yehuda is at least legit in the sense that they only sell one kind of hummus: ""Hummus""! Not ""Traditional Flavor"", not ""Original Flavor"", just Hummus!). You also may want to drizzle some olive oil on your serving, too.",0
"This Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is a robust sauce with strong chipotle flavor and a creamy consistency. Ingredients include soybean oil, whey, vinegar, buttermilk, sugar and egg yolks, with less than 2 percent chipotle chile pepper puree.<br /><br />I had some confused idea based on the packaging that this was a chipotle sauce mainly for salads. It's a bit too flavored and strong with chipotle flavor to go well with my typical summer salads consisting of arugula, lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, anchovies and nuts, with the produce items hand-grown and picked. If I subtracted the anchovies, the sauce harmonized better, but still, this definitely is not an all-purpose flavoring. I think there may be too many warring ingredients for a theme to come through for this sauce.<br /><br />So I switched to adding it to homemade tacos consisting of queso fresco or Monterey jack cheese with chopped onions, homegrown grape tomatoes on fresh tortillas from the nearby tortilleria. Much better results. I'm a fan of strong flavors, but it's tricky to figure out the best use for a premade chipotle sauce.<br /><br />I notice Allrecipes has recommendations for enchiladas, turkey wraps, chicken in chipotle sauce and chipotle sweet potatoes, so these may be the best way to go.",0
"The review title about says it all.  It was fizzy, tasted like an orange drink made popular by important travelers of the 20th century, and didn't disagree with my stomach like orange juice does.  The plus was definitely the taste; I have used another vitamin C loaded product which is almost bitter in comparison.  I don't recall feeling any extra energy, although I felt good each time I took the product.",0

"I love blueberries (fresh blueberries are very tasty and very healthy), and I love blueberry flavor. So when these arrived I was expecting something very tasty. However for me, these clusters tasted like they were a bit old. I like that these clusters are not very sweet, and that they contain whole grains, flax seeds and oats (very healthy), and fiber. But I just did not find them very tasty.<br /><br />Overall this makes for an average nice snack",0
"This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.",0

"I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the ""Tropical Fruit"" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the ""Organic Strawberries"" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5.

"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",0
"Being relatively new to the coconut milk scene, I started at my local grocery store with the only coconut milk I found there -- Thai Kitchen.  It was delicious--so rich and creamy.  I was hooked!  Imagine my surprise when I opened my first can of Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk.  It was thin and watery, not thick and creamy like the Thai Kitchen.<br /><br />I read the Amazon reviews and learned that coconut milk from Sri Lanka is thin and watery, while that which comes from Thailand is thick and creamy.  I checked the can.  Yup.  Sri Lanka.  The reviews are correct.<br /><br />The main reason I bought coconut milk from Amazon was that the price was a little cheaper buying it in bulk.  But I would rather have the better coconut milk and pay 25 to 30 cents more a can.  I probably won't buy coconut milk from Amazon anymore, since the customer is not able to select the country of origin for the product.",0

"This Beneful is a rather confusing or misleading product. The company wants you to think this food is healthy for your pet. The reality is though that it is nothing other than a bag of grain and fillers. Sure, many dogs may like it and eat it, but it is not exactly nutritious for them.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to mind it too much. He didn't seem overly excited by it, but he did eat it. He poked around at it a bit though beforehand.<br /><br />He did have much softer, lighter colored stools too, and went to the bathroom more often. The stools did not look like ""healthy"" stools. It was more like a step or two away from diarhea. I hate to sound gross here, but it is important to mention.<br /><br />The bag does clearly depict corn and veggies right on the picture on the front, so I guess it should be no real surprise, but it just seems like Purina was almost trying to pull as fast one on the consumer - make the food sound/look healthy and beneficial even though it is no better than the cheapest generic bag you could possibly find. Also, notice how the picture of the ear of corn is so prominent in comparison to the other items - it is because this dog food is mainly corn, as is with most all cheap/generic brands.<br /><br />For some, this may be suitable, but it is not something that I want my dog to eat regularly. I mean, if I was really super tight on cash, and my dog was out of food and Beneful was dirt cheap, clearanced, on sale etc - sure I might grab it to use for a day or two until I could buy him a bag of real food... but as for buying it regularly for daily consumption, it would never happen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either unless your vet specifically tells you that your dog needs a corn and grain filled diet because of some serious health issue or something. I've never heard of that happening, but I guess anything is possible.<br /><br />I did give Beneful 3 stars simply because my dog did eat it, so it must not have tasted too terribly bad.",0
"This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention too is that this product can ""spit"" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.",0
"I give the company high marks!  The product arrived quickly, and I very much appreciate the 'gift' package of free 'Honey' Jerky' included. The package was small, but delicious. That in itself prevents me from going below 3 stars.  I took off a star because the Hot Shorts are not even close to being 'mild', and far off from being 'hot'.  Another star because the taste is...just passable.<br /><br />I don't plan on ordering these specific 'Buffalo Bills Hot(?) Shorts' again, but I do plan on ordering other products of theirs.  I am a 'subscribe & save' customer here on Amazon and have a couple of other 'Jerky' subscriptions that I'll end up cancelling and then changing to other offers once I find better replacements.",0
Some of mine arrived w/ the seals broken too.  This product is very good though and Amazon has great customer service.  The packaging for this item did get better with the second order.,0
"I purchased a pound of feta cheese. When it arrived, it appeared lighter than a pound. I have two digital scales. I weighed the cheese on both scales. Both scales reflected a weight of 14 ounces. That is certainly not the 16 ounces, (a pound), that I paid for so I was not happy. Two ounces do not seem like a lot to be concerned about, but you should get what you pay for when you order from a company by weight. I do not appreciate the fact that I was not given the full pound of cheese.",0
"I had been buying this product since we got our puppy in June, and our puppy loves it. The product was fairly priced in from that time till August. When I tried to order this month, what an increase of 11 dollars! As much as I love this product, I am not going to spending so much anymore. I am currently looking for other options.",0
"I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!",0
Great price with 6 packs but it is really weak. It takes two tea bags to make the tea as strong as others.,0
"I was anxious to try this lower calorie version of one of my favorite foods. Overall, texture is fine, but taste is bland and seems to lack depth of real peanut butter. I would use this in recipes, but was sad to say it wasn't my favorite and I would eat regular peanut butter instead.",0
"Coffee ground specifically for stovetop espresso pots is pretty hard to find so I'm always curious whenever I discover a new brand.  I was especially looking forward to tasting illy because of all the rave reviews.<br /><br />I've brewed this coffee in a couple of different sized moka pots and each time it produced a nice smooth cup of espresso, which made for great cappuccinos and lattes.  Compared to Lavazza Caffe Espresso, the illy has a bolder, slightly charred flavor thanks to the darker roast.  Some people may not like it for that reason, but I find Lavazza a bit mild for my taste and this is just dark enough without being too bitter.<br /><br />With that said, it's unlikely I'll be buying illy again.  Compared to most ground and whole bean coffee sold elsewhere, its pretty overpriced for a pre-ground coffee.  I tend to buy my coffee fresh whenever possible and use the pre-ground stuff occasionally.  A pound of freshly ground Italian espresso roast coffee at Whole Foods or your neighborhood coffee shop makes tastier coffee and is far cheaper than a can of illy.  Lavazza, still a perfectly acceptable coffee, and Cafe Bustelo, a dark roast Cuban blend (my current favorite) are both better values for pre-ground espresso.  Both are less than half the price of illy.",0
"When I tried this cereal right out of the box with no milk, it tasted pretty good. And really sweet. When I tried it with milk, it again tasted pretty good, but after awhile the cereal gave the milk an after taste that was a little different. Some flavor in the cereal leeched out into the milk and made it taste a little off.<br /><br />Overall, this cereal isn't bad, but it really doesn't have anything that's much different from many other cereals already on the market.  I tend to eat cereals that are a lot less sweet (like Cheerios) so I'll pass on this one.",0
"I only gave this 3 stars because I used this fondant for my daughters birthday cake and though it's very easy to roll out it was almost tooo pliable. I made a decorative bow for the top and wouldn't hold up in the heat. Kept falling down and loosing it's shape. It's great though for making flat shapes to stick on a cake, cupcakes, etc.",0
"I dont know if they sent me an old bag but they were hard, not chewy. I bought them because my dogs love the chewy treats. My dogs do like the flavor and smell, but they were not chewy. To my dogs, it is almost nothing more then the dry dog food they eat. I bought 2 bags and both were hard.",0
This product is really a hit or miss. My cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats....Sometimes he does not eat these right away.,0
"I love good coffee but I hate a strong taste. This is perfect! It has an excellent smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Just writing this makes me crave a cup. Unfortunately the packaging is ridiculous and I won't deal with it again. It was impossible to open the bag by pulling the seal apart. I had to resort to cutting it open with scissors, which created sharp edges in the heavy foil. with better packaging, I would definitely rate this 5 stars.",0
"I am not that fond of instant coffee, but I have to admit that this was pretty good. I'm a big fan of anything with pumpkin spice so this was right up my alley. I think the only downside to this coffee is that it's pumpkin flavor was not strong enough. They might have been going for a subtle approach, and maybe that works better for some coffee lovers, but I like strong flavors. Maxwell House always makes good coffee and I think this was worth checking out.<br /><br />I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.",0
"I purchased the Timothy's ""Breakfast Blend"" k-cups for my wife.  ""Breakfast blend"" is her favorite coffee choice, one of the coffee selections her employer supplies for their Keurig brewers.  She does not judge the taste of the Timothy's brand as good as the Green Mountain brand provided by her employer.  Having tried both, I concur.  The taste is not bad - just not as good.  However, the price per k-cup for the Timothy's brand is attractive.  For us, this is a case of one gets what one pays for.",0
"I also recently tried the peach variety of this Mio water enhancer. As with that one, I felt I had to do two squeezes here to really get some flavor. And you do have to stir -- the liquid is not going to automatically dissipate in the water. Not bad things, just observations. But hey, it's a tiny little package that will flavor up to 24 glasses of water, so that's convenient.<br /><br />As far as the taste, it's definitely sweet tea coming through. I never knew what sweet tea was before moving to the South, having been a huge fan of straight (unsweetened) hot tea all my life. But this flavor is fine and reminds me a bit of the instant tea mixes like Nestea. At two squeezes, it's lightly sweet, not overly sweet.",0
"Item is satisfactory .... I think it may be of some benefit.<br /><br />i seem to be having more energy, but I take it along with MCT oil<br /><br />so it is difficult to see which is working. But combining the two<br />seems to help.",0
"This is a strongly flavored, astringent oolong tea.  It is reasonably priced (that is priced as a beverage) and the same tea being sold at several times the cost by various vendors pushing it for its weight loss properties. It produces a cloudy, medium brown brew with strong, slightly rough flavor. Oolongs from this particular location are reputed to aid in losing weight.  I prefer smoother oolongs with a lighter, clearer brew, but this is a matter of taste.  This is a good, solid but not inspiring tea.",0
I give this three stars because of fast shipping! But it was poorly packed when it came to me it was split in half i have been trying to do what i can to help it live but after 2 weeks it only looks worse. It makes me very sad because i have been looking forward to having it a long time and trying the fruit but i guess this wont happen,0
"I can see that many people like this tea, which surprises me--but there are plenty of teas for all of our different tastes! I'm only writing a review to warn non-tea drinkers not to assume their guests or gift recipients will like it.<br /><br />I drink hot tea--but only black tea--continuously throughout the day and someone gave me three boxes of this as a gift because it was reviewed highly on Amazon. :-) I've tried several cups, thinking I could do something with it to make it palatable to me, but I can't.<br /><br />I think both the dry tea bag and the final product have an unpleasant aroma. The taste of the brew is offish in some way and the after-taste isn't pleasant to me either. I served it to two friends and one thought it was good but not as good as other Rooibos she had tried. The other friend sipped for awhile and left it. She commented on the dried grass smell, which was what I didn't like either. I can tell that a lot of people like it--I just wanted to warn that many might not.",0
"I like the single serve packets, making it a quick grab with a bottle of water for work or school.  The positive is this Lipton Green Tea in Honey, Mango Pineapple flavor is true to taste, offering a real sweet combination of the three flavors.  The negative is that I just couldn't get past the disinct aftertaste from the sucralose additive.  I've tried other lo cal drink mixes, and all basically offer the same flavors with artificial sweeteners to save on the calories.  So unless you enjoy that metallic after-flavor with your drink, pass these up and go with plain and refreshing water or sparkling seltzer.",0
"The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.  Overall, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the contents of the pouch, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I used it as a base and added leftover peas, carrots, and corn and pasta but I do think the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UURF5W"">MTR Hot & Sour Clear Soup</a> is better for this purpose.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, edible starch, potato, carrot, cabbage, khol khol, beans, peas, sugar, salt, onion, macaroni, refined sunflower oil, garlic, and pepper.<br /><br />Khol khol is more universally referred to as kholrabi, a vegetable in the cabbage family that looks much like a turnip.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian and appears to be vegan but is not labelled as such.  The nutrition information is per serving at five to a packet but two or three servings would be much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup and a little over half a cup per serving is not realistic unless you serve it in a teacup.<br /><br />Calories 35<br />Calories from fat 5<br />Total fat 0.5g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 600mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein less than 0g<br />Vitamin A 4%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 3.0g of sodium.

"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",0
"Though I doubt this item will be liked my most American palates, I think overall the product is okay.  This is a product of Singapore.  If you're not all that fond of Thai curry, then you probably won't care for this either.  Personally, I LOVE Thai curry a lot more than this.<br /><br />I do have a few ""issues"" with this product.  First, there are ""leaves"" in the sauce, and they can be quite ""tough"".  You might want to strain them out.  Next, the sauce is quite ""oily"".  The first ingredient in the sauce is vegetable oil.<br /><br />One totally ridiculous thing is what they show as the serving size and servings per package.  They show that the package serves 15 people and a serving size is two tablespoons.  Totally outrageous.  The reason they do this is so that it makes the calories look low (110 per serving).  The directions show to add 28oz of beef tenderloin, which is also crazy.  One would NEVER use such an expensive meat for a box mix such as this.  Beef stew meat works just fine. But based upon what the box shows as a serving size, then you would have less than 2oz per-person.<br /><br />I also think this item is quite expensive for what it is.  Also, I don't think I'd be interested in making this 4-times before the product expires.",0
"If you used to drink Sassafrass tea in the spring, just know that - for your own protection - granny gove has decreed REAL sassafrass hazardous, so this isn't it.  The smell is nice, and you can't blame the company for following the law and ""fixing"" it.  Won't order this item again, however it was well wrapped and arrived on time, so will order other items from this company - just not adulterated sassafrass.",0
"It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.<br /><br />I liked it except for the licorice flavor.",0
I would not give this a 1 star but I would not give it a 5 star either. I am thinking 2 1/2 is fair. The thing that bothered me the most was the color. I bought a 70 calorie K cup apple cider and the smell and color were both wonderful. This is more of a watered down coffee color and the taste is just ok..I am not sure if I will buy it again or not..for a 10 calorie hot drink I guess I really should not complain..,0
Interesting ingrediant list. Tried this in a couple of soup & veg dishes. Definately better in soups. Will continue to experiment!,0
"These are manufactured in China.<br /><br />While my little Maltese absolutely loves these, I can no longer risk his life by buying anything for him to eat that is made in China.  It seems that every couple of months in the news, there is a new set of canine deaths being reported by owners who fed their dog(s) food or treats manufactured in China.  It is really scary.<br /><br />My dog is like family to me.  I'm not going to risk his life or a huge vet bill to save a buck or two on food made in China by a culture of people that lace toys they sell us with lead and other harmful chemicals.",0
My title pretty much says it all. I feel that this is good coffee at a fair price but I wasn't impressed enough to reorder it. I will try something else in my next order.,0
"When this arrived in the mail I opened it up and let my kids have some for a snack and it was ridiculous.  They went crazy when they tasted the chocolate and I had to confiscate the stuff before they ate the entire box.  When I asked if they wanted milk in their bowls of cereal they scoffed at the idea of diluting the chocolaty goodness.  They pretty much consider this stuff a treat like getting a cookie or piece of candy.  This is somewhat appropriate since a serving (3/4 cup which is a lot less than what my 3 year old can eat) contains 24g carbs of which 11g are from sugar.  Looking in my pantry I found an 8oz bag of Chips Ahoy Mini Chocolate Chip cookies that contains 21g carbs with 9g of sugar.  To be fair, the Krave nutrition label is in line with many of the cereals marketed to young kids these days.  Similar to Cocoa Puffs, Capt. Crunch, etc.  However, in looking at Kellogs' marketing of this stuff I don't think they are going after young children.  I believe they are targeting tweens, teens, and young adults.  I'm not sure that makes anything better or worse.  Just an observation...  Anyway, the cereal does taste sweet and chocolaty and crunchy like they advertise.  Far too sweet for me to imagine sitting down and eating in a bowl with milk.  I admit I have reached in and taken a small handful to munch on when craving something sweet.  However, I would not be a buyer of Krave cereal for my young kids as I think that similar to most of the cereals marketed to kids they are just too high in sugars and empty calories.  The vitamin fortification all the companies do is really just a way of distracting consumers and really offer little in terms of healthy nutrition.  I will step off of the Michael Pollan soap box and say that the stuff does taste good as advertised and if you get it, eat it as sort of a treat and not a main course.  Remember, back fat is never coming in to style...",0
"This coffee is good...tasty, even. But it's not nearly as good as the Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve (Extra Bold), which have been by far the best K-cups I've tried. Timothy's has nice flavor but the body is lacking in depth and richness. It feels a bit thinner, and not quite as complexly flavored.<br /><br />Given a choice between this one and the G.M., I'd choose G.M. -- but given a choice between this one and any non-fair-trade coffee, I'd always choose this one. It's a great buy, and it is a good choice for someone who doesn't like their coffee too bold or too dark.",0
"Forgot what it had tasted like until we bought a case......then remembered what it tasted like......and gave half the case away to our local homeless shelter.<br />It's a staple for the holidays if you can't/don't make fresh, but nothing healthy enough to serve often.<br />It's bread crumbs with spices, so easily created with better and fresher ingredients made at home.",0
"The company that sent this was great, I got it in like 3 days of ordering it. Great price compared to other stores. Would buy from them again but the product itself was gross. I followed the instructions to the letter but the pearls are yucky. I was making Bubble Tea for my GS Troop and no one would eat the tapioca pearls. I really thought it would have some sort of flavoring, I was wrong. The drink itself was good flavor but to me the pearls don't add anything to the drink. It's a decoration thing. The pearls are pretty color but I think I would go with just a solid color next time. Like I said the company great product not so much and the seller has nothing to do with that.",0
"I eat basamati brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless.<br />It cooked very well in my rice cooker, but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor.  The grains are finer and have less body than what I have enjoyed in other brands...maybe personal preference.  Would not try again.",0
"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.",0
"I am used to eating corn flakes that are somewhat salty - yes, really! I can tolerate it being somewhat sweet but these are flakes are a tad too sweet - not my taste.",0
I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely. However the cost is more than I can justify. I will be canceling my next shipment.,0
"Called a stew, but it's really a soft pate, and with big chunks of green beans and carrots.  Overall my cat seems to like it okay -- not a difficult task for him to work around the vegetables and leave them in the plate.",0
"The regular elbow shells of kraft mac n cheese have never been my favorite (everyone knows shapes is where it's at!) These veggie noodles are made of cauliflower apparently, and I prefer their flavor! They are less artificial tasting but just as starchy. The cheese left something to be desired, but we ended up adding bacon and it made it DELICIOUS (not surprising; bacon makes everything better). Overall, it isn't too different from the original macaroni. I would buy it again, but for the most part I'll probably stick to shapes for now!",0
"Hmm, my outdoor pond goldfish like it, as well they should as this comes out to $36/lb, more than lobster.<br /><br />So, what to do? Buy and grind up fish and wheat germ and whatever else is on the label?  Nothing motivates my fish like mosquito larvae, but living amongst those evil bloodsuckers is more than I want to do.<br /><br />Oh, well, I'll just get whatever seems to be the best deal at the time and maybe the herons and egrets and racoons  will live a better life near the top of the food chain. They seem to like fish that have been fed expensive food.",0
"With a name like Snackwell's (""well"" underlined for emphasis), the line of products tries to advertise itself as a healthy snack. This snack's box draws attention to the fact that a serving contains only 130 calories. Despite the convenient portion-controlling packages, do not mistake this product for a healthy treat. A company will often market foods as low in fat or calories, but while these foods contain fewer calories, they compensate for the loss of delicious fatty ingredients by containing excessive amounts of sugar. The Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, for example, contains 18 grams of sugar per serving! Although tasty, the popcorn is overly sweet and thus tolerable in only small amounts.",0
A friend of mine gave me a couple triple chocolate bars to try out. They were very tastey and I was going to buy a box until I noticed they contain partially hydrogenated soybean oil which I stay away from.,0

"This is decent coffee. Nothing special. It is not very strong or distinctive. Does not have much ""jump."" Nothing wrong with it either, except for the fact that for a coffee product that prides itself on being environmentally sensitive, it is being sold in single pod packages that are anything but. Time to leave that sort of contradiction behind.",0
"I used this gravy in a shepherds pie recipe, and it wasn't very good. Haven't tried it by itself though.",0
"Recently, I have discovered the pleasures of panko bread crumbs. I had used the standard bread crumbs for years and years and years. Finally, after having heard about panko bread crumbs foir quite awhile, I decided to try them out. This is the third brand that I have used now.<br /><br />I would not say that this is the best of the three. But it is reasonably priced and does the trick. It adds a very nice coating when used; its taste is a bit lighter than my standard bread crumbs and it makes a nice crunchy topping. I really like its texture when cooked.<br /><br />So, a satisfied customer. . . .",0
"This has great chunks and a good flavor, but I was not blown away.  The capers made me think it would have more kick, but it was just basic bruschetta.  I recommend it if you can find it on sale.",0

Nice present to give and the the flavors are unique.  We were hooked on these cakes when we last visited Barbados.,0
"Nice and spicy which I like, and a good buy (which I like too), but it's part pork and I didn't know that before hand. I would have preferred all beef, which is why I rate only three stars instead of five.  I won't buy it again, but ONLY because of the pork; otherwise, it's very good.",0
"I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be ""deluxe"", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic.",0
"I enjoyed this tea very much. It has rather strong citrus odor when open a bag. However, it's just right when brewed.The only problem I have with this is them calling it ""organic"" and cannot tell where it came from. It being a ""mix of teas from all over the world"" doesn't inspire 100% organic. :)",0
"I had never tried popchips before and was curious so I thought the variety pack would be a good option to try several of the flavors. I love potato chips, but I know all that fried stuff is no good for me, so I tried the popchips. While I found some of the flavors very tasty, especially the spicier ones, I just did not find them to be a replacement for potato chips. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for popchips, but if they were the only thing around, I would eat them.",0
Ordered these for my husband and he said they are okay but he likes the Green Mountain brand better.  Next time will order the Green Mountain brand.,0
"This is not my favorite brand for green rooibos tea. I was disappointed in the taste. Other brands, such as The Republic of Tea, sell a much better tasting one. Once you open the packs, you must find a way to keep them fresh. I put them in an empty metal container that has a tight lid. I would never buy this brand again.",0
"Great Idea! Great toy to keep dog occupied. BUT....<br /><br />HOWEVER, in serious need of design improvement. I went through 2 toys and had same problem with both. Lid cracked where lid joins jug, making toy worthless. Needs rubberized bottom or screw at the top of jug.",0
"These were nice cookies. Peanut buttery, chocolatey, rich, with a little crunch. The filling was a little too glue-textured but other than that, very decent. The price they are being offered for on Amazon is nuts, though. Is this a savings off of the grocery shelf? If it is, then just barely.",0
"I found it to be a very sharp, raw product. Works very well on its own, but difficult to combine with other ingredients. The chocolate is just too overpowering. I tried infusing it with herbs and spices, but none of it showed up. The chocolate is tight and composed, with earthy tones. Somehow anything you add to it only serves to bring out more of the chocolate's textures and flavor; I found it hard to tone it down, much less balance it out. Works very well as a base for chocolate souffle.",0
"I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.",0
"Package arrived on time and in one piece, but after eating some I noticed the flavor of some is stronger than in others.  About 1 in 5 has no flavor and I end up spitting it out.  If they all tasted as good as the few good ones I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.",0
"I liked to Yunnan Pu-erh Tea the taste was smooth and mellow not over powering. What I had a problem with, I had the same shaky feeling I get when I drink caffeine. I don't know if product has caffeine but I felt like it did.",0

"I am only egg intolerant, not allergic. Adding this to my oatmeal cookie recipe today resulted in dry dough and crumby cookies. It's barely okay. Additionally, I'd rather do without all that soy.

Glad I only got a sampling of the powder instead of an expensive pound or two!",0
"My dog loves dried chicken jerky treats, but almost all are from China which concerns me.  Trying to find a safer alternative, I stumbled on these.  If you're looking for whole chicken breasts which have been dehydrated, these aren't the same.  They are pieces & parts molded together and almost look like cardboard.  My dog likes them, but they don't seem like anything special to me.  They do say organic, so hopefully are safer, but I'm not really impressed.",0
"My last purchase of raw pumpkin seeds was from a different seller/brand and they were delicious. I went with this brand this time, mainly due to the price. The reason these are much less flavorful is because they have NO SALT. I understand that salt is unhealthy in large amounts, but I dont have a heart condition (yet) and I like a little salt on nuts.<br /><br />The seller needs to include important info like that so that people can know what they are getting. I will of course eat these, and they would go great in home made trail mix, but I will be salting the ones I eat by themselves.",0
"I'm a type 1 diabetic and am supposed to avoid ""bad"" foods. Kashi sort of has a reputation for healthier fare, which initially attracted me to this cereal.<br /><br />What a taste! I enjoy the cereal very much; it's crunchy, sweet, and filling. It doesn't taste as processed as lots of common sweet cereals, and isn't bland at all like typical ""healthy"" cereals.<br /><br />For those without my specific health issues, I'd highly recommend this cereal as it's pretty darn good and relatively healthy. However, it has a pretty high glycemic index and really gives me sugar spikes, so unfortunately after this case I'm done with the product. Farewell Kashi, you sweet seductress of the cereal isle.",0
"I've tried only the caramel, chocolate and hazelnut flavours so far and am disappointed. This is the first and last time that I will buy a sugar=free syrup. I don't usually do sugar-free but I was recently on a diet so I gave in. In any case, I've had regular Torani syrups in the past, and they never failed to please. The sugar-free chocolate was gross. Did not taste like chocolate at all. The caramel smelled very hopeful, but ultimately tasted awful as well. The only one so far that actually tastes like its indicated flavour is the hazelnut. For the time being, I am back to my regular Torani syrups, but perhaps one day soon, I'll brave another sugar-free one...",0
Nice and soft but the first taste is of plastic from the bag they are shipped in.  I don't believe I would purchase this product again.,0
"This is an acceptable mix for SF cocktails, but it is very heavy on the sweet and light on fruit flavor.  I will use it up, I will need to add strawberries and make them blended to avoid the drinks just tasting like sweet tequila.  The color is insanely bright red in person, it didn't taste too much like food coloring though so that was good. It tastes better mixed with dark rum, berries and a splash of cream as a low carb daiquiri. I am glad I got it on mega sale.",0
Purchased this to replace the Organic Hibiscus. It's OK but the Organic Hibiscus is much better. Have gone back to the Organic Hibiscus.,0
"I bought this Green Taco Sauce from Amazon because it is our favorite taco sauce and is difficult, if not impossible to find locally. Since purchasing this product, I learned that I am gluten intolerant, and the taco sauce contains ""modified food starch"" which is a nonspecific ingredient that can be derived from innumerable sources, and may contain gluten.  As a result, I cannot eat this product anymore.  I would advise the manufacturer to be more specific in their labeling as to the starch origin, and better yet, to standardize on a starch (corn, rice, potato, etc.) that does not contain gluten.",0
"I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers",0
"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead.",0
"Somehow I thought I was skipping the ""gourd"" by getting the aluminum cup, but just know that this is simply a gourd wrapped in aluminum. With that said, it's a nice little kit for a good price. The metal straw does get hot unlike others but it's great and easy to clean. The Yerba Mate did sprinkle a bit inside the box but overall it's a good kit and great as a gift.",0
"This tea has a very grassy, vegetal taste and smell, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.",0
"I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!",0
"Yes, they are very large, but for me completely inedible straight out of the bag. The shells are like soft cardboard, and there's no taste. It would be nice if the company would include preparation suggestions with the seeds. I've been experimenting with mine and have had partial success in making them palatable. First I soaked them in mineral spring water overnight with sea salt and smoked salt. Then I drained and dehydrated them for 24 hours. They were getting closer to crunchy and even had a bit more pumpkin seed flavor. Next I took 1/4 cup of the dehydrated ones, put them in a skilled with a sprinkle of olive oil and roasted them just to a light brown, then sprinkled on seaweed and brewer's yeast. (Lots of options for seasonings.) They're pretty good that way, but I doubt I will purchase again. Maybe I'll just start buying a fresh pumpkin every time I want to eat the seeds. It would be less trouble and much tastier.",0
"I thought I was ordering unsweetened, since I typed ""Almond Milk Unsweetened"" in the search bar. This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Amazon would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Amazon search engine isn't perfect.<br />Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product.",0
"First things first: it tastes great, so your kids will love it. However, if you're looking to improve your health, I'd try it but then upgrade to something with less sugar.",0
"So far, I've loved all of the coconut water brands and flavors I've tried, including Zico. However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it. Zico's great, but I'm definitely going to stick to the box from now and on.",0
"The food coloring definately did the trick for red velvet; however, if you are a clutz at all in the kitchen like me you are going to have a heck of a time getting the dye off your hands and off your countertop. I normally use the other name brand but I got three bottles for the price of one. Next time I will buy the other...who needs this much food coloring anyway and my countertop is still slightly pink...",0
"I love the coffee's in this assortment, but it also included too many decaf and tea varieties that I was not expecting.  There were also these ""lemon drinks"" that I have never seen before and don't like very much.  To top it off there were 2 kkups missing from the 48 that should have been there.  Next time I will order one flavor that I like the best instead of this.",0
"kind almond & apricot bars are a 5 star product. But this mini pack is just too $$$ not worth the price, i would just buy the normal size 12 pack.",0
Good flavor but they still have not solved their packaging problem.  I would say that 15 to 20% of the cups leak and leave a lot of grounds in the cup. If they would solve this problem the flavor and value would easily top 4 stars.,0
"I hate to not leave an overly positive review, but I bought these thinking they would be uber-fresh.  They tasted like old Jordan almonds.  The price was good, but if you are looking for good ones, I'd find a local store, not these.  Too bad, I was disappointed.",0
"I must preface this review with: I am a Gu fan. I've tried so many different brands, flavors, and types of gels/blocks/cubes, whatever, and I love Gu to get the job done. For PowerBar, I've tried the Vanilla, which is really delicious. It tastes like cake frosting! However, the vanilla does not have caffeine, so this does not fill my needs. I have tried the Double Latte, which I abhor--I thought it was AWFUL. It just stuck to my teeth and wouldn't go down, and yuck yuck yuck. I love coffee, too. But as a liquid, in a mug! :) I have heard from many runners that they enjoy the Green Apple, so I might try these in the future. The PowerBar brand is a thinner consistency than Gu or Clif, so sometimes I think it goes down a lot easier, especially if you're not near a water fountain or aid station. If the vanilla had caffeine, I would probably stick with that one. I couldn't run the distances I do without gels. I take one on a daily run of 7-8 miles, I'll take 2 gels on a weekend run of 14-16 miles, and I'll take 3 on a run longer than 20 miles (in addition to Clif Bars). I hope this helps someone make a gel decision!<br /><br />Oh, in addition, I want to point out that PowerBar gels are made in a facility that manufactures dairy products, whereas Gu does not. I hope this helps the allergy sufferers out there!",0
"Maintaining a healthy diet is always about choices.  I can choose potato chips to go with my sandwich or apple slices.  I love both, but choosing the apples will have a nutritional benefit.  The chips will not.<br /><br />Having said that, I understand that Nabisco is trying to offer not a 'more healthy' snack but a if-you-must-snack-at-least-lower-the-fat-and-calories choice with this product.  I appreciate that.  I do have those stressful days when my attitude is one of survival--as in, ""I need something sweet and decadent to survive this day.""  On those days, I reach for something other than apple slices.  And this caramel popcorn, given it's crunchiness and flavor (and fudge drizzlings!) would be perfect--except for the corn syrup.<br /><br />Had Nabisco chosen another sweetener, I'd be a convert to this popcorn and would be buying boxes to keep in my cupboard at work.  But the corn syrup is a deal breaker for me.  If it's not for you, try these!",0
"Enjoy twice the crunch: Kashi go-lean crunch is an intestinal wrecking ball. Fun to eat, tastes great and then.... generates the most amount of farts imaginable from a breakfast food. Really, no exaggeration, this cereal should be a registered weapon.",0
"I love the s/f chocolate torani syrup.  Have ordered it many times w/o incident.  This time though, the plastic that the bottles were wrapped in was weak.  When I picked the package up out of the box, the plastic broke, one bottle fell to the floor and broke open.. spraying chocolate syrup all over my floor, the wall, even some hit my freshly repainted ceiling.<br /><br />Just be careful when lifting these out of the box.",0
"I am very happy with the price and service Amazon provides with its subscription service.<br />Now, the quality of the Newman's Organic Prunes leaves a bit to be desired: I keep getting chips of the pitts.  At least a couple of chips per bag.  The other brands (not organic) never have chips of pitts in them.<br /><br />Amazon: great!<br />Newman's Organic Prunes: OK (three stars and not more).<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dave Weekley",0
I purchased this coffee with high hopes for a sweet light roast.  It is ok but has a strong coffee taste I did not expect. I recommend Gloria Jeans Macadamia Cookie for anyone who want a sweet light coffee.,0
"I do not consider myself any kind of professional but I did take up coffee as a hobby nearly two years ago. I have tasted nearly two dozen single bean varieties and a few blends. I have tasted both generic Sumatran which tastes of the local soil and Sumatran Blue Batak the latter being a special favorite which I hope some day to find as a peaberry offering.<br /><br />That said, I was expecting a coffee commensurate with the price of the coffee. What I found was a coffee where most of the flavor comes from the roasting rather than from the bean.<br /><br />This is not the quality one expects from $1/oz beans but rather from an average grocery store offering at maybe $0.70/oz.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Consider roasting coffee analogous to toasting bread. You can get flavor out of a bland white bread if you toast it enough. That is what was done here. There is little intrinsic flavor in these beans yet I know Sumatra produces some excellent coffees which the correct roast enhances their flavor rather than producing a generic roasted flavor on top of next to nothing at all.",0
My dogs love these treats but to tell you the truth I can't tell if they are helping their arthritis or not.,0
This espresso is quite bitter and doesn't blend well with milk for a latte.  It does offer a good caffeine buzz... and it does have good creme and body... but I cant get over the burnt/bitter essence. Even my husband who has a much higher tolerance to bitter coffee complained.<br />Espressos I have enjoyed are Peets & Green Mtn organic<br />I did try this company's Bean Martin blend and found it more flavorful... but it also has bitter nature and seems more acidic than I care for,0
"Tastes just like coconut milk and curry powder with a few simple spices. One reviewer observed that the potatoes in this recipe closely resemble tator tots. She is absolutely right. It tastes pretty good if you like curried foods, but you can make it yourself very easily, cheaper and without having to order a case, and with real organic ingredients.<br />There is NOTHING on the package that says any of the ingredients are ""Organic"". I strongly dislike deceptive advertising and hope that this was not intentional.",0
"I was really excited to try these cookies, after reading the reviews. I love tart lemon desserts, and am a huge fan of ginger in all forms. The cookies were very nice, and I am sure that all 12 boxes will get eaten eventually. For me, however, the lemon was not tart enough, and the ginger taste was very mild. I would rate it right alongside the lemon cookie sold by the Girl Scouts - also over priced, but at least you feel like you are contributing to a good cause!",0
This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.,0
"The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great.",0
This has a very strong Apple Jolly Rancher taste which is not bad in moderation. It's not something I would want to drink often.  It's a break from the usual Crystal Light flavors.  The price seems a little high (though when you do the math it works out to less than 14 cents per serving.  I have not seen these in the store so I don't know if Amazon's price is comparable.<br /><br />If you don't mind feeling like you are drinking a large liquid apple Jolly Rancher then this might be a nice change of pace for you. Especially if you like Appletini's.,0
"When these products were offered as the deal of the day, I read up on them and started salivating at the prospect of all that bacon taste in a jar. I also researched the J&D website to check out the nutritional info and found that all the other bacon salts except the natural one contained MSG. So I went with the natural.<br /><br />The product has a very smoky aroma, but underneath it all you can still tell it is salt - lots of salt. I think the paprika must add a lot to the sensation of bacon, as well as the smoky smell and flavor.<br /><br />I have tried this on a few things and it does give food a bacon flavor although of course it is no substitute for the real thing. It's healthier, though; while it still has lots of sodium at least it has none of the other bad stuff. It is good to use as a condiment to sub for bacon when you have the craving but don't want to spend the time making it or eating it and getting fat. I give it three stars. It is good to have around and serves a purpose, but it is nothing fantastic.",0
"I like to have a few cold canned coffee beverages on hand, as I prefer them to most energy drinks. Unfortunately finding one that isn't filled with sweeteners has become very difficult.  Living in the Seattle area I was already familiar with illy for their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYUI"">coffee beans</a> that are used in some of my favorite coffee houses. So being given the chance to try some of their canned coffee beverage was something I was looking forward to.<br /><br />After spending the night in the fridge, I opened the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Cappuccino</a> without shaking it as noted on the can and poured it into a glass. (*See customer images) The color was good with just a hint of dairy. The smell was nice too, but from that I could already detect the sweetness that I was about to taste.  The coffee was strong and smooth, but overpowered by the sugar.  After half the glass, I couldn't drink any more and offered the rest to my daughter who enjoyed it.<br /><br />Overall illy issimo has a great product, but like many canned coffee makers they overdo it on the sugar. I would much prefer the coffee be the focus of beverage with just a hint of sweetness if they feel the need to add it.<br /><br />*For those not interested in the overly sweet drinks like me, check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a>. It's a much better option than the cappuccino version. Good flavor, but no dairy and not as sweet.",0
The vials will exploed if heated up for vaaapp usage. Other then that for using them just as a container they work fine. Good price and fast delivery.,0
"I was suprised when this arrived, it was a huge 15lb bag.  I thought for some reason it would be a small sample bag.  The bag is large and attractive with a heavy ziplock top.<br /><br />The food inside is multi sized and colorful but way too big for my Chihuahua's to eat.  Also, I worry about all that extra dye in the food. Dogs can't see color, so the company is making the food look appetizing solely for the human owner. I picked out some of the smaller pieces of kibble but neither dog nor the cats were interested..hmmmmmmmm. While my animals usually eat ""Taste of the Wild"" food, I know the dogs are picky eats but the cats eat everything, including bugs so it was a little weird they wouldn't touch it.<br /><br />I decided to have a look at the ingredients-it was mostly corn.  One cat will eat corn of the cob so perhaps if I had wet it down he would have eaten it LOL.  On a serious note, corn as a main ingredient isn't really too ""beneficial"" to the health of a dog. I suppose this food is better quality than a lot of grocery store dog foods but it really as ""healthy"" as the advertising would make you think it was.  Not a bad food but not the best either. It's a shame-all the advertising and makeing the food look pretty but not spending that $$ on making it good for the dogs.<br /><br />Rather than throw away 15 lbs of perfectly good food, I found a local animal rescue that happily wanted the donation of the bag of food.",0
"I love the product, they're yummy....however, my baby has choked as well as another friends baby while using these...they tend to break off and don't dissolve too fast. I'm sure when my baby is older they may be ok, but def a choking hazard!!",0

"I suppose I may be fussy, but this jam just didn't impress me. It's too sweet and seems to lack the tart 'kick' one expects from eating pineapple.  I suppose I'll just have to go back to making my own.",0
Received notification it was sent along with the USPS number but never got it. I e-mailed and they responded promptly. They sent out another one--- but the bag had no label and was torn.,0
I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.,0
"I like to eat Kashi Crunch and I was hoping this would be a slightly tastier alternative.  But when they says a ""hint of brown sugar"" they mean it!  These squares were not very exciting when it comes to flavor and I could barely register the brown sugar.  They are relatively filling though and with some fruit on top, they would make a good, quick breakfast for an adult getting ready to head out to work, with 4 hours until their lunch break.  But I don't feel it stands out much from other ""healthy"" cereals for adults.",0
"I usually find ""flavored"" coffee to be cheap, terrible-tasting coffee that's overly-perfumed so you don't suspect how bad it is until you taste it.  Gevalia's Dark Chocolate Truffle didn't fall into this trap--it's a decent, but not great coffee on its own.  It has a little bit too much of a mocha flavor for me, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing I've found that works great is that I use the Gevalia for 1/3 of my normal grounds allocation, and my normal coffee for the other 2/3.  This yields a cup of coffee that has a nice chocolate taste, but not overwhelmingly so. (To clarify--if I'm using 3 scoops of coffee, I'll use 1 of Gevalia and 2 of my normal coffee).  Of course, I'm also the kind of guy who puts three different types of cereal into the same bowl at once, which I realize isn't for everyone. This coffee certainly isn't one I'd drink every day (and I drink a number of cups of coffee each day), but it is nice on occasion.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a chocolate-flavored coffee, you could do worse than this one.",0
"It's hard to review something a dog eats. Our dog didn't say anything about this treat, but he did gobble it up heartily. Then again, he gobbles up any treat I give him. I can't say I noticed anything different about his reaction to this treat than compared to, say, Milk Bones, except it takes him longer to eat these (they are hard). The makers leave it up to the dog owners to know or assume the benefits of this treat, because it doesn't say what they are on the bag. The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience. Maybe it's just the marketing consultant in me, but I think it would be useful to list the benefits as well as the features.",0
"I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had. That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients. Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct. This is an Watermelon/Strawberry flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine. In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking the real juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke. This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free. It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you. While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future.",0
"These are standard Lipton tea bags, like at the super market but at considerably less money.",0
"Well I was very excited because I like the Stevia plant sweetener and I figured this is going to be just as awesome. Plus I love Ginger. I love the smell of it and taste of it. Ginger is awesome. So I'm thinking that what's not to like about a drink that combines both the things I love.<br /><br />Taste: I give it 2.0 stars<br />-There is a slightly bitter after taste but it's not too bad. It does dissipate after a while.<br /><br />Zero Calories: 4.0 stars<br />-Because that's always a plus.<br /><br />Ingredients: 2.0 stars<br />-This is what killed it for me. I love Ginger but I could barely taste the Ginger at all. I would have preferred a stronger Ginger taste but maybe some of you might enjoy the hint of ginger more.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 2.5 stars<br />- I  still like the fact that there are drinks made from natural ingredients; unfortunately, I just didn't care for the taste at all.",0

"My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these ""edible chews,"" so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones ""chewy"" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).",0

"If you happen to dote on dried very tart cherries I suppose this is better quality than some. It disappointed us after all the good reviews. The texture was like very large raisins. The taste was not just tart but really sour. The only sweetness was from the added sugar, not the cherry juice you might expect. I think you'd have to be a special sour cherry lover to enjoy snacking on this product, and I don't think most kids would go for it. I'm not sure we'll be able to finish our first order.",0

I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!,0

"If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food - and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by-products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.<br /><br />I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food.",0
"Considering this is available at a subscription at a bit over $1 per can, it's a great bargain.  I've frequently used Thai Kitchen's Coconut Milk and this is comparable in quality, though this product requires a bit more shaking-of-the-can to mix the milk before use.  I don't mind that at all.<br /><br />Note that the picture displays ""light"" milk.  But the Product description simply says ""Ty Ling Coconut Milk.""  I received regular milk as opposed to light milk.",0
I thought I was getting a bargain because this is less expensive then R.W. knudsen brand - but isnt near as strong I add 4 oz of RW to 32 oz water and it still has a bite to it- this takes 2 times as much and still doesnt have the same effect- I had signed up for auto deliver  after trying it had to cancel.,0
"These bars by Pamela's Products are OK.  They are very chewy and moist.  Also very stick-to-your-teeth.  However, taste is limited.  There is a general bland undertone, overall, but somewhat heavy on the oat flavor also with a bit of a coconut undertone.  There is no noticeable chocolate taste (to me).  However, the chips' soft slick variance from the other chewiness is obvious.<br /><br />Bars (of any kind) can be very personal to folks in taste (like or dislike).  Try and see for yourself.",0

Would they actually be the same as when I was young. I looked at the contents and was disapointed. The gloss of the chocolate was not there it was a pale color, it looked like it had been frozen before. I ate one and the taste was about the same. Out of 54 pieces, my wife and I were able to eat 5 total before we realized that my child (9) ate the rest. They must have been great, but the look was not right.",0
"Tastes good; I am not exactly a fan of Granola but I did like this (my son finished it in 2 days and left me only a little). Right dose of cocoa (chocoloate nuggets) makes it tasty. You can buy these separately from Whole foods or other stores and mix them yourself, may be, but this mix is made of only natural, stuff that it is worth buying this.<br />One con is that it is more powdery at the bottom and is not exactly made up of big nuggets.<br />Do note that this has saturated fat (though no added salt/trans fat etc..) and so enjoy this in moderation.<br />I will buy this again..<br />Only reason to give 3 star is the price of this compared to what you get and the powdery/very small grains in the package.",0
5 star taste but why so expensive for plain popcorn with salt<br /><br />i love this product but even on sale very evry expensive. popcorn is soooooo cheap to make why can't someone duplicate this product for about 1/3 the price and still make a killing. it would also be a great snack for birthdays in schools in lieu of cupcakes if not for the very high cost.<br /><br />great taste. nice convenient pacakging just way way too expensive,0
"I would have given this product five stars, but I didn't receive five boxes. We only received four boxes and they were delicious and weren't going to expire until the end of 2011. It was more fresh than cereal you buy at the store. However, contacting Amazon was very inconvenient and took a really long time to get it straightened out because of language barriers. We are trying it again and if we receive all five I'm sure I will give it five stars.",0
"If your looking for a good eye-opener in the morning, when it comes to coffee,Coffee Bean Direct Mocha Java will do the trick. It tastes okay, not bad in fact, but just wasn't anything to get excited about. I didn't think as the ad here says that it ""Closely approximates the taste of real Mocha Java."" Just tasted like regular coffee to me. The beans seemed fresh and there is that pleasant coffee aroma when I first opened the bag and when I grind up the beans. But it isn't that kind of beckoning aroma that I love.<br /><br />I tried this Coffee Bean Direct brand out because it was seemed like a really good deal at the time, comparatively speaking with similiar brands.<br /><br />Here is a few I would highly recommend for coffee lovers:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN4A"">Organic Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Medium Roast, Ground, 80-Ounce Bag</a> - also available in whole bean<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BYIS6"">Newman's Own Coffee Cafe Almond Biscotti Ground, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL7GK"">Audubon Premium Shade Grown Coffee, Shade Song French Roast, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />So Coffee Bean Direct is okay for it's price range, I'll use it for now - just nothin' to write home about....Laurie",0
"Lets get this out of the way - I regularly pop whole habanero peppers in my mouth and douse my food with Dave's Ghost Pepper Insanity Sauce.  That being said, I was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured I'd give this a shot.<br /><br />They don't lie when they say it's HOT.  I put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although I wasn't in pain, I was in moderate discomfort for about 10 minutes.  I think the thing that got to me the most was that the taste was just not very good.  I'm no culinary expert and I'm sure it's extremely difficult to make something that hot taste good but compared to Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce it was bottom shelf in that department.  That being said, I will be giving it another chance soon, trying to incorporate it into a hot chili experiment.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're after a sauce to spice up a dish and leave it (mostly) edible for everyone but the diehard hot lovers, I'd recommend sticking with that sauce.  If you're reading these reviews though it's clear that you want hot, and this sauce doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Heat: 5 stars<br />Overall product: 3 stars (for taste)<br /><br />Scoville Scale reference:<br />Habanero ~ 250k<br />Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce ~ 650k<br />Da' Bomb Hot Sauce ~ 1500k",0
"I have bought and enjoyed the other Primal products, so I thought that I would give these a whirl. Overall flavor is not bad, I just find these dry and kind of blah. They do not have the intense flavor of the Primal jerkies. I suppose the other thought is that perhaps different lots or batches of these products are better than others, who knows what the quality control in Taiwan is comprised of? These items are very difficult to open without a knife or scissors, so don't plan on opening away from home. Overall they seem a bit too dry, they actually break apart as you try to remove them from the package. Pros: Another Veggie option for us. Cons: Hard to open, only okay flavor and a bit on the dry side.",0
"The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness.  Too bad they don't taste like that.  The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth.  At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away.  If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased.  Otherwise, they're just ok, not great.  At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type.",0
The taste of extra strength is better than regular 5 hour energy but I still question the ability to give ME more energy. Would recommend if you like energy products.,0
Don't brew on high setting if you drink a breafast blend normally becuase you will find these flavored coffees kind of weak.,0
"To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.",0
"I have switched to another brand of greens that doesn't seem to be as rich in fiber as this one, but has a better flavor.  It depends on your taste, but both brands of greens provide about the same nutrition.",0
"I ordered this because I wanted to support the monistary, and the photo showed a substantial fruitcake size.  I was so tiny I was really appalled!  For $15.00, it was definitley not worth it, due to the miniscule size.  It was about 3"" X 3"", and the photo did not show how very tiny it was.<br />It was well made, very moist, wonderfully delicious, but way over priced for the very tiny amount of cake delivered.  I was frankly shocked that clergy and people who supposedly are honest and God fearing would do such a scam.",0
"When I started grinding the beans I noticed a slight haze coming from the grinder.. The coffee smelled great but when I went to put into the filters it was dust, not that oily tacky moist but not wet type of grind but this was pure dust like the beans were either very old or roasted to long. I believe if they would sent a fresher batch it probably would have been the best  cup of coffee I ever had. I might try them again, maybe after Christmas. All in all it's a questionable buy, I would have to give them a second try to give a solid  review, but for now I would say it would be a C+ or a B- at best.",0
We first had anasazi beans when an aunt brought them from New Mexico as a gift. Hers were from a local place and had much better flavor but it is ridiculously expensive to get the place to mail them to us (guess they haven't found out about flat rate boxes or something) so we tried these. They are good enough but we will probably wait to get more until our aunt comes to visit again.,0
"It's a bit odd that this particular flavor of Salada green tea is even titled decaffeinated, but NO where on the actual box does it state that it is decaffeinated. Salada's website says their green teas are decaffeinated - but if so, why not state it on the box itself? Some of their flavored teas (eg, purple antioxidants) DO come with a decaffeinated label on the box. This one does not, whether purchased at Amazon or in my local supermarket.",0
"I thought I wrote a review but it magically disappeared. Anyway, here it goes again. These peppercorns are okay but lack the punch of better ones I have had in the past. Those are hard to find though. You taste them in dishes like shuizhurou in authentic Sichuan restaurants, also hard to find.",0
"I tried this cookie at the same time I tried Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These cookies are better than Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, but they still fall short of what I expect from Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />I have given up expecting products to look like their packages.  I suppose there is a bit of artistic license in making food look as though your mom and grandmother whipped it out of a bunch of basic ingredients.  The problem, of course, is that the cookies bear little resemblance to the picture on the package.  Things seem to go downhill from there.<br /><br />Try putting one of these cookies on a napkin next to the package.  The picture on the package is beautiful, with chocolate chips on the outside and gooey chocolate in the middle.  I could barely see the chocolate chips on the cookie itself because something, crumbs I think, covered the chocolate chips.  None of my cookies were lovely and round like the one of the package.  Instead, my cookies were mostly broken and I had a difficult time removing more than fragments from the package.<br /><br />Well, beauty is only chip deep, I suppose.  The important features are the taste and the texture.<br /><br />The texture was okay.  The cookie seemed chewy and moist to me.  In general, I thought the texture of these cookies compared favorably with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />The taste was okay.  The taste was hardly great, but okay.  I tasted cookie dough and then a chocolate hit, about what I expected for chewy chocolate chip cookies.  What I missed was the creamy chocolate in the center of the cookie.  I tried several of these cookies, trying to taste the creamy chocolate in the middle.  My taste buds could not separate the taste of the supposedly creamy chocolate from the other flavors in the cookie.<br /><br />These cookies need to compete with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies along with dozens of other varieties.  In order to do that, a new cookie should be phenomenally good to convince customers to change brands.  However, this cookie is hardly phenomenally good.  In my opinion, this cookie is just average.  I believe there are many better options available, particularly given the price of these cookies.  My prediction is that either this variety will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  Meanwhile, you have plenty of other, better choices.<br /><br />Good luck!",0
"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",0
"The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK",0
I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.  But this lime and chili flavor...I think I would only enjoy it with a beer.  The lime flavor is just way to intense.  I will not be ordering this flavor again.,0
"It is a very strong tea, but I can't say it is extremely flavoreful. This tea made my heart race. I will not buy it again.",0
"As a drink it is only okay.  Each 12 oz. can contains 10 calories and 200mg of caffeine (about the same as 2 cups of coffee, or 4 cans of diet coke).  It works to wake you up, and gives a bit of an energy boost when you're dragging.  It is made from green tea and acai berry.  Both can take a bit raspy for lack of a better word.  It is not really bitterness, but has a definite aftertaste.  Although the raspberry adds quite bit of sweetness, it doesn't get rid of the funky harshness of the green tea and acai.<br /><br />As a regular drink, I would pass.  As an ""energy drink,"" it tastes better than some others I have had.  I can't say whether it helps you lose weight, but I have noticed that I get hungry earlier than usual.",0
"The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.  Overall, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the contents of the pouch, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I used it as a base and added leftover peas, carrots, and corn and pasta but I do think the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UURF5W"">MTR Hot & Sour Clear Soup</a> is better for this purpose.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, edible starch, potato, carrot, cabbage, khol khol, beans, peas, sugar, salt, onion, macaroni, refined sunflower oil, garlic, and pepper.<br /><br />Khol khol is more universally referred to as kholrabi, a vegetable in the cabbage family that looks much like a turnip.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian and appears to be vegan but is not labelled as such.  The nutrition information is per serving at five to a packet but two or three servings would be much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup and a little over half a cup per serving is not realistic unless you serve it in a teacup.<br /><br />Calories 35<br />Calories from fat 5<br />Total fat 0.5g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 600mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein less than 0g<br />Vitamin A 4%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 3.0g of sodium.

"Love Cheerios, always have because of their oaty goodness and lack of sugar, but now General Mills doesn't keep the production line clear of nut byproducts and regular Cheerios are frequently contaminated (see the warning on the side of the box).  It's unfortunately because this is otherwise a good product.<br /><br />I still buy Cheerios for the family but I can't eat them any longer because I'm allergic to peanuts.

"I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.",0

"I love the Original Easy Mac because it tastes just like the boxed Kraft mac & cheese.  So, I decided to try the Extreme Cheese variety thinking it would just have more of that same cheesy taste.<br /><br />It doesn't.  It tastes.... different.  Unfortunately, I'm one of those people that generally doesn't like new foods.  If I'm eating a food that I grew up on, it needs to be very similar to what I ate when I was growing up (for example, my mom's beef stew has a gravy-like consistency, so beef stew recipes I try now that has red wine in a brothy-type liquid, I'll end up not liking it, because it's not like Mom's!).<br /><br />This Extreme Cheese variety tastes like a different cheese... a swiss-like flavor, maybe?  I think that's best how to describe it, a strong bittersweet flavor of Swiss cheese that's been aged a long time.  But I don't like Swiss cheese, because I was raised on cheddar.  I've tried two packets of this Extreme Cheese stuff, and I simply cannot bring myself to eat it.<br /><br />Oh, well, I gave it a shot.  Those who aren't as picky as I am might very well like this variety, though.",0

"These are supposed to be a ""crunchy"" bar, according to the package, but the nuts are the only crunchy thing about them - otherwise they're sticky, chewy bars!  Which doesn't mean they don't taste good - they do - but they stuck to my dental work something awful.  Before I knew that, I gave one to my Mom to try also - she wears dentures and couldn't even begin to eat one of these bars.<br /><br />That being said, the ingredients listing was pretty decent, not any ""weird"" ingredients or preservatives.  A little high in sugar content for my low-carb eating style, but enough protein to offset some of that.  They're really just a higher-protein candy bar, without high fructose corn syrup and no transfats either.<br /><br />For a quick, stick-it-in-my-purse type snack in case I get caught out and about with no other choices, these would definitely hold me over til I found something more suitable.",0
"To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here.",0
"This simple boxed dinner, a Hamburger Helper for the celiac disease market, has one major virtue and one major flaw: it doesn't taste gluten-free.  But it also doesn't taste like much of anything at all.  It cooks up quickly and easily, and the noodles have a soft texture and mild flavor very different from most GF foods.  But the cheese sauce has an airy ""Cheez Flavr"" that leaves no significant impression on my taste buds.  Because of the cooking speed, and the fact that one box with a veggie side dish could feed four, I give it five stars for convenience.  But its utterly forgettable taste and undistinguished character only merit two.  I split the difference.",0
"Not bad, and perfectly drinkable, but bland with no liqueur. Not as bitter as some Columbians I have had, but that, unfortunately, goes back to the 'bland' bit.",0
This product taste's ok but it's the texture that gets me. It had kind of a grainy texture. I looked at the ingredients and wheat flour is in the ingredients. Why they would put wheat flour in this licorice. I think that contributes to the odd texture. This is the only licorice I've ever eaten with this weird texture. My favorite licorice is Natural Vines strawberry or black licorice which they sell here on Amazon. It is all natural and has no preservatives and no weird texture.,0
"I thought I was receiving 8 packs of eight instead of 6 packs of eight, therefore, I paid way too much for this product.",0
"These were ok but far too salty. Also, although it looks like it would be an individual serving, there are one and a half servings per bag. Since it is difficult for many of us to leave a third of a bag, we end up eating too many calories!",0

"I love cereal, and one of my favorites is Frosted Flakes.  Kellogg's, maker of Frosted Flakes, introduced this new Crunchy Nut cereal in 2 forms.  This type is a flaked, sugar-coated cereal with tiny chunks of peanuts on the flakes themselves.  Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut has two layers of flavor.  The primary flavor is exactly like Frosted Flakes, and the cereal has the same shape and even similar texture and sugary glaze.  The secondary flavors would, according to the name of the product, supposedly taste like honey and nut, but what I taste the most is molasses.  That is an ingredient in the cereal, as is sugar, honey, and corn syrup.  Lot of forms of sugar in this cereal.  Despite having honey in it, I notice no honey flavor at all.  There was another, harder to identify taste which was I finally realized was peanut, but it was overwhelmed by the other sweet flavors.  Despite little peanut bits on the flakes, it didn't immediately taste peanutty to me.  Overall, the molasses flavor left a weird aftertaste that I did not find pleasant.  These weren't flakes I could eat right out of the box, as milk was necessary to tone down the powerful, almost cloying taste.  The flakes did stay crunchy in milk for quite a while as compared to a lot of other cereals.  I think Kellogg's could reduce the sweetness by a significant amount and improve this cereal drastically.",0
"I don't get the hype around this product, at least not yet.  I bought it mainly because I wanted my child to eat apples without taking the skin off and I wanted the skin of the apples to be wax free. After following the instructions, I did not find the skin on my apples any less waxy than before washing it with this soap. Maybe it is supposed to look and feel exactly the same even without the wax off, but for some reason I always thought that once you got rid of the wax, you were not supposed to have this shiny and gliding surface where you can see droplets of water stuck to the apple. Anyway, I will keep using it since I have so much of it, but I don't think I will be buying more of it until I see some definitive proof that it works.",0

"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste.

The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.",0

"The 150# Lab liked this product; the tiny Chihuahua turned up her nose.  Of course the Lab will eat most anything and the little princess must have her deli-turkey.  Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food seems to be a run of the mill grocery store pet food made by Purina with a yummy package photo to attract the humans who purchase these products.<br /><br />The ingredient list certainly has a lot of grains which can be viewed as cheap fillers to boost the profit margin for the manufacturer and not the nutrition value of the pet food.  To me this is just another bag of fancy pet food marketed to people who make their decision by looking at the picture on the package and not reading the label.<br /><br />I've noticed that several other reviewers questioned the ingredient ""Animal Digest"" or wondered what it is.  I looked it up and the unappealing definition is: (actually I'm not going to post but you can go to Wikipedia and see for yourselves).<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food is not a bad product; just another in a long line of Purina Pet Foods.  More affordable than the ones your Vet pushes, more affordable than the Chihuahua's deli-turkey but still more expensive than many other reputable brands.  And what's with this ""Chef Michael""?

"I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it.

I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin.",0
"This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.<br /><br />While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).<br /><br />This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.  But the veggie amount is low, so you are better off adding fresh vegetables to a regular box of Kraft Mac and Cheese.",0
"I've been drinking coffee since I was a kid, and that was back in the 1960s when coffee was coffee, an unpretentious drink whose own flavor, with the addition of cream and sugar, was enough. Now, of course, there's an endless variety of flavored and gourmet coffees for that seemingly upscale crowd for whom a cup of good old Maxwell House would be as unthinkable as wearing their grandfather's hand-me-downs.<br /><br />I'm still a Maxwell House-Folgers-Chock Ful 0' Nuts kind of guy myself, capable of enjoying a coffee from McDonald's more than I could one of Starbucks's syrupy products. Still, I like Starbucks coffee, but more as a change of pace than a habit. The same goes for ""flavored"" coffees which I consider as unnatural as menthol cigarettes. As flavored coffees go, however, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, of which I received a complimentary package, is pretty good. The vanilla flavor is very apparent in both the taste and aroma, and just misses being overwhelming. I enjoyed it, but did not follow it with a second cup, choosing to switch to my usual unflavored brand for that. As previously noted, I enjoy flavored coffee as a novelty, preferring ""real"" coffee instead.<br /><br />So, I'm giving this product a mild recommendation. I probably won't be buying it myself in the future, but if flavored coffee is your cup of tea, this might be for you.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks",0
As a coffee fan I like my coffee with bold flavor. Weak coffee just doesn't do it for me. Real cappuccino should be rich like a desert. This Illy Issimo canned coffee just isn't strong enough for my taste. The flavor itself is nice and it's handy to be able to just reach in the fridge and pop open a can. Some of you may really enjoy this. You'll save lots of money over coffee shops which is always a good thing. If you like your coffee mild I say give it a try.,0
"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.",0
These cookies were okay. My 2 & 6 year old sisters loved them but I don't think I'd buy them for myself.,0
"While this isn't horrible, I'll get the red bean chili next time.  I really like Amy's products so nothing is ever too bad so far, but I think I'll pass next time.",0
"Guys, do you know what ""malossol"" means in Russian?<br />""Lightly salted"".<br />This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit.<br />Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeon's caviar.",0
"Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.",0
"I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.",0
"If you like banana bread, then you will love this bar! It's pretty soft and chewy, with lots of flavoring. It is a little too sweet for my liking (but then again I am not a big fan of banana nut anything in general). The nuts don't overpower the bar taste, which is good! The price is a little high but I do think you get what you pay for - especially since it is a very healthy product.",0
"The coffee has a great flavor for decaf. I am disapointed in my most recent shipments. One in four of the k-cups explodes in the machine when prepared. The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.",0
"I grabbed a bag of this when it went on sale at the local market and, although one of my cats really likes it, I can't stand the smell!  Honestly, it smells like horse doo.  Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag!  It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.  The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat.  I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor. Just be careful,your nose will have to be made of steel to get past the smell!",0
"This item was listed in the gleuten free section but it is not. I did get a complete refund from Amazon, but was disappointed that I could not eat them. I guess this is what happens when you try to do things in a hurry and don't read every single word about a product, and rely on the search to bring up accurate data.",0
"I got this for my husband who loves green tea.  I would love to not be constantly purchasing all the big jugs, and the idea of having something that generates less trash is incredibly appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he thought there were ""too many different flavors"" in this, and he suggested I let the kids have the rest of the box.  He also complained about a funny aftertaste.  I chalked it up to him just being picky.<br /><br />The kids liked the flavor.  Their complaint was that it is pretty much impossible to mix in a glass (in a water bottle it was easy though).  And they also complained of a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />With all of that, though, they did continue to ask for more until the box was empty.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews from my family.",0
"Two out of four bags purchased have been great.  Good for at least a day of chewing by our happy Lab.  However, two bags must have come from old cows, because they couldn't be chewed.  The dog gave up interest quickly.  We tried soaking them in water, but this had little effect once the they dried.  Overall, they're great whan you get a ""good"" bag!",0
"This matcha is not good enough for drinking straight. It doesn't have the bright green color and good aroma that a good quality matcha should. However, it IS labelled as culinary grade, which really means for adding to ice cream, smoothies etc. And for that, it's OK. Don't expect anything more!",0
I had bought this at a local store and tried it it out. This is my review.<br /><br />For a small bottle (less than 2 oz)if you use it right this can actually last a long time. Just a little bit of it in a water bottle goes a long way. But be careful not to press on it to much or to much will come out and it will be grossly sweet.. Seriously just barely pinch it and it will really be enough to flavor the water...<br /><br />The only other negative is the additives in it... They are not very good for you...But then again what diet sweetener really is?<br /><br />But other than that it is not bad!,0
"I agree with the other reviewer in that it is an acceptable sen-cha, slightly ""fishy"" and grassy.  Green Tea is our daily morning beverage, so it's fine for that, but lacks considerably when compared with other higher-end organic loose leaf green teas.<br /><br />I don't regret giving it a shot, and will gladly go through the 16oz bag I bought - but will probably look for a better organic green tea next time.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Recession special!  I'm reordering... :)",0
"Not too crazy about it,looks like Kelloggs Corn Flakes.Too hard to eat it right out of box.Not sweet.i got it on huge sale $9.00 for 5 boxes(which are kinda small)",0
"I'm a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker but I find these little tins make a nice change and a peppermint  coffee sounds good for the holidays. Unfortunately the delivery didn't live up to the promise.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. A Christmassy peppermint smell with a thick froth of foam on top. Sitting on a table top perfuming the air it's like a commercial for Christmas. The problem is that the flavor is too weak. After all the promise it just sort of falls flat. I tried to make it with more powder, same effect. It looks and smells wonderful but in the end it just disappoints. Not really worth the money.",0
"This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their ""paranormal hosts"" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,""say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!""Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.",0
"i drink my coffee strong and black so this is too weak for me.  i do have the one pot coffee maker and i either have to decrease the water or use two of these.  this is not economical.  it is much easier to just wrap some french roast coffee into a paper towel and use that instead.  if you like very mild coffee pods, this i s fine, but not for those of us who can't get it strong enough.",0
"This was okay in a pinch, if you like Velveeta.  The broccoli in the package was very small, almost like some dried herbs.  You'd be better off throwing in some frozen broccoli while cooking this.<br /><br />I tend to make things from scratch, but if you're rushed for time & need to get something on the table, this was acceptable.",0
"The product is good. But I just realized that the price is more than double than other similar lychee. I bought a similar one from Whole Foods, only $3.",0
"I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled.",0
These pecans were well enough for when you are cooking with chopped pecans such as in waffles or in cookies.  I don't know that I would use them for pecan pie because they just aren't the big fat moist ones you would want as a center stage ingredient.,0
"Its god awful nasty if u try to drink it with a 8oz cup of water, i just mix a small amount into my salad.",0
"I love this cat litter, it smells great, and is easy to clean up...but...Amazon keeps drastically changing the prices!  It's a great buy at $9 a bag, but when they suddenly jack it up to $18 a bag, it becomes a horrible deal.  I had the product on my Subscribe and Save, until I found myself paying $50 for three bags of cat litter, which is a little ridiculous in my mind.",0
"I thought this might be a good back up for when I run out of Keurig cups, but I find it be really weak coffee. It doesnt really work that well in the coffee maker so I use it as a kind of teabag. But it's just not strong enough for me to purchase for coffee.",0
"As others eperienced, my Gingerbread house had a rough journey. The packaging was a little loose and caused the box to shift around easily and ended up cracking several of the cookie panels(front and back). I was able to use Elmers glue to fix them for assembly but only after allowing to dry overnight. The cracks were still visible, but It was my only option as there was not enough time to return it for an exchange before Christmas. I must say that had I known how hard the icing would be once cured, I could have just used that instead of the glue. That stuff could be used as mortar mix to build a brick house. Even though this is made of edible materials, I would not attempt to eat any of it after assembly as it would probably chip your teeth.<br /><br />Overall this was a good experience, but just know you are gambling if you have it shipped. It would have to be packed in peanuts to arrive safely. The bubble packing they use now just can't protect it unless they overstuff the shipping box, and that could crush the contents as well.<br /><br />AVS",0
"I tried this product after Switch's Watermelon-Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange-Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so it's not really clear that it's THAT much healthier than other sodas.<br /><br />Personally though, I'd rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.  I guess it depends on what you are deciding to ""switch"" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.  But as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas, this product isn't close to making me want to ""switch"".",0
"The idea was on the right track, but it look my thirty pound dog about a minute to dislodge the ""everlasting"" treat (which took him about ten minutes to consume). He's not a power chewer either. The pockets, inside the treat ball, made my financial loss a little more bearable - the ball itself will be useful.<br /><br />Pros: Won't have to buy the everlasting treats every so often.<br /><br />Cons: Will have to find something else to occupy him.",0
This KIND bar is pretty intense.  The chocolate and cherry combo create a really strong flavor. The palm kernal oil ingredient in the chocolate is a concern as that oil is not said to be very healthy.,0
"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",0
"Well, it doesn't get much better than this down at the dollar-a-can level.  I was actually able to eat a can of these cold, which says a lot.  There were four medium size fish in the can.  They had a mild taste which balanced well with the mild but still assertive mustard sauce.  After trying some of the other really ""cost effective"" brands of sardines, I expected the worst, and I was pleasantly surprised.",0
"My dogs love these, but they can go through a bag in one training session.  I wish they had bigger bags or bulk purchase options.",0
"When I saw this product I thought it was absolutely the best thing out there that was going to make my life so much easier.  So I ordered them and they come in the 4 pack here so you'll have 8 spoons.  It was slightly less than the price I see today for 8 of these.  Other sites are cheaper but you only get 2 and you end up paying around $7-8 for just the 1 pack (2 spoons) so I figured why not get more.  I now regret it ...<br /><br />The spoon is a bit too deep and big for my 9 month old.  She uses the ""NUK Gerber BPA Free Soft Bite Infant Spoon"" and those are very soft, not as deep, and just the right size.  These spoons are plastic and too big for her mouth.  I would say it's okay and that she'll grow ""into"" it but the foods they fit on are for 6 month old babies so it doesn't make sense to have a spoon this big.<br /><br />Well, I still love the idea so I'll keep trying but up until now I've had no luck with her eating out of these.",0
"Let me start off by, this stuff tastes like DOODOO. YUCK!<br />The taste can easily be covered by some bananas and peanut butter, but those are both things I can't stand.<br /><br />This stuff does not mix very well, either. Not even when I used a blender.<br /><br />I'm sure there are others who can stand the taste, but I personally could not drink it without gagging.",0
"This coffie is strong, which I love! But the after taste is a bit like black licorice, and that makes me gag! I've been looking for a strong coffee, and I was hoping this would be it :( Maybe with some extra flavored creamer, I can learn to enjoy it.",0
This is my go to drink - but you can buy a 24 pack at costco for about HALF the price listed here.,0
"The bracelets are fairly small, but you get ALOT in the box. The candy itself tastes fine, but the string tastes bitter. I hope it's not toxic... o_O",0
"They call it ""Crunchy"". This is much more than crunchy.<br />The taste is actually good, not to sweet. nice honey and nut flavor.<br />BUT<br />The clusters are big and very hard. Like rocks<br />when i eat this i have to pour a bowl, add milk and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before i can eat it<br /><br />I much prefer Kashi Heart to Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal,",0
"I don't really have much confidence in any commercial pet food,  but the  ingredient list for Newmans's seems better than most.",0
"The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.",0
"First a little background on me. I Am a coffee drinking fiend. I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price.",0
"My cats loved the first two bags, but the latest one repelled both of them. Even the one who wants to eat himself into obesity so badly that he eats filth off of the floor. I can't say that I blame them, because the smell was worse than usual. The bag doesn't expire for another 19 months, so I think the manufacturer has some serious quality control problems.",0
"Of all the souveniers of the upcoming Royal Wedding that I have seen, this ROYALTEA ROYALTY TEA BAGS FIFT SER WITH THE ROYAL WEDDING FAMILY FIGURES, PRINCE WILLIAM, CHARLES, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and etc. seems to me the goofiest.  If you put the tea bags in water, you wind up with the Royals looking as if they are in a jacuzzi!  Plus, if you put the tea bags in the water and make tea, the ""value"" of this ""collectible"" goes. er....down the drain.  No more collectible -- it's been used up!  (The only way to drink the ""Royal"" tea in this set, and still have a collectible, is obviously to buy two sets -- something which, I daresay the manufacturers of this set hope you will do.)<br /><br />The ""faces"" on the tags of these ""Royaltea Royalty Tea Bags"" are all CARICATURES of the Royal people portrayed -- and they are not very complimentary caricatures, at that.  In colonial times in the USA, (and probably in England at the time, as well), ""dunking"" a person in and out of a pond, won a chair tied onto the edge of a pole, was either a test for witchcraft, or a civil punishment, (my knowledge of history isn't so great that I remember which.) At zny rate, the ""dunking"" of these tea-bags, with royally-faced tea-tags, (and perhaps, even dunking the tags themselves), is, methinks, an uncomfortable modern parallel. Thus, this ""gift set"" of tea RoyalTea Tea Bags, with uncomplimentary caricatures of royal faces on the tea tags, could be, I believe, a present more to the tastes(?) of anti-royalists than of pro-royalists.<br /><br />Naturally, this could also be a nifty gift just for collectors of memorabilia of this Royal Wedding, no matter what their feelings about the Royal Family.<br /><br />A while back, there was a ""tempest in a tea-towel"", as the Royal Family and their representatives, flatly refused to allow tea-towels commemorating the Royal Marriage to be made -- as they only want LASTING memorablia of this wedding to be produced. The decree was finally reversed.  Tea-towels commemorating the royal marriage CAN now be made, as they have been made in the past to commemorate other Royal Marriages and events.  However, these RoyalTea Royalty Bags Gift Set teabags are surely more likely not to last as long as tea-towels do; even if one DOESN'T use them to make tea, a stray drop of water can easily ruin one, or more tea-bags in this set.  If bought, and collected, it therefore should be carefully kept away from ALL water and moisture.<br /><br />So, is this ROYALTY ROYAL TEA BAGS GIFTS SET, really a ROYALTY ROYAL TEA G_A_G_S<br />GIFT SET?  Is it a tribute to the Royals, or a subtle slap in their faces?  Is it worth the money, if you are seriously into colleting Royal Memorabilia?  Is it, by it's somewhat fragile nature, a collectibe that may not last, and therefore isn't worth your money?  Or is it, that, just by that somewhat fragile nature, something that will grow in value as a collectible, because of that fragility?  Are there other Royal Collectibles of this truly momentous Royal Marriage, that may be worth more in the future, which are now selling at, or near, the same price?  I guess that, in my opinion, is something each person to decide for themselves!",0
Sort of maple flavor but not really very good for making maple walnut ice cream.  I've started using the real stuff--Maple Syrup and it's way better.,0
"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.",0
After trying The Long Lengths Nourishing Conditioner by Clear Scalp I was looking forward to being equally impressed with this shampoo.  The pros for me were the scent (super nice) and the easy open spout.  Otherwise I was disappointed.  It is described as a moisturizing formula yet my hair felt stripped after use.  If not for the highly effective conditioner mentioned above I'm sure my hair would have felt a little straw-like when dry.,0
"These beans are heavenly and we love them, so we thought we would start a subscription for them to be delivered to us.  Unfortunately, when I opened the box and the plastic packaging inside, there were three seriously dented cans in the middle of the set of cans.  I find it hard to believe that they have gotten that dented where they were placed in the center of the set of cans without messing up all the cans around them unless they were set in there that way, so we paid for 12 cans and end up with only 9 usable cans.  Unless I find a way to get the other three cans to replace these I will be canceling the subscription and not buying this brand any more.<br /><br />It is too expensive in our local health food store, and we thought this would be a great idea. Since we got three unusable cans it ends up being too expensive again.  Too bad since it's a wonderful product my whole family loves.",0
"Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid. I thought it was just ok. A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me. It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one.",0
"The box we rec'd in on 10/19 has a ""best by"" date of 4/11/12. The nuts had a bit of a stale taste, and also noticed the chocolate coating looked like it had melted a bit and then became solid again, showing creases from the packaging. Even with subscribe & save, the bars are approaching $2 apiece, that is too much to pay for something in this condition, I think. If they fresh and in premium condition I think they might be worth the price, or of course if heavily discounted in their current condition. Perhaps if they move out this 4/11/12 stock and replace now in the cooler months, they will stay fresher longer.",0
"One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food.",0
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.,0
The presentation is impressive and will get the recipients attention.  If you are looking for a great flavored tea collection.  Look elsewhere.,0
The taste is nice though it is VERY mild. I need to use two pods per one cup of coffee.,0
"The pricing is way off.  The description says that it is a savings over the $14.95 retail price, but that is the price of 4 jars at Bell Plantation's website, not just one like on Amazon.  I will be buying this somewhere else.",0
"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.",0
"One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.",0
"My toy poodle was quite interested in this toy, but it proved difficult for him to play with.  He has a small mouth and it was hard for him to pick up the yellow pieces to get at the treats.  It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.",0
I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page.,0
"This granola is pretty good and satisfying, but nothing super special.  This company makes a pumpkin flax seed granola that is to die for, so i was hoping this would be similar, but it isn't.  If you can find the Pumpkin Flax Granola, get that instead!",0
Never used this product before and was surprised that there were no instructions in the package.<br />I will try experimenting assuming one of the contents is lard instead of oil.,0
The blend is very strong and full flavored.  I was expecting more of a French roast flavored blend.  This coffee is the harshest I have tasted.  If you like a coffee that is super dark and will give you a kick this is the one for you.  I'll finish this batch and try the French roast next.,0
"This tea is rather cheap and you get what you pay for. It is a low-quality white peony tea and you should brew it for longer to get the typical strength and taste. I would say 4-5 minutes instead of the more typical 2-3 minutes. Even then there is some quirky chocolaty flavor.<br /><br />Finish your newly purchased tea quickly or, better, put it into your own spare tin boxes because this type of packaging will not keep it fresh for long.<br /><br />Next time I will probably pay more and buy some silver needle white tea (higher quality than white peony). Or I will buy my white peony in a brick-and-mortar store, where I can taste it first. This tea is not bad, but is not very good either. I cannot really recommend it.",0
Read other reviews that were very positive and decided to try it.  Not my favorite.,0
"Have now tried it on a number of different things including tacos and burritos, turkey burgers, cheeseburgers and as a veggie dip. In all cases, so-so. It is essentially a spicy mayo without any great character - about what you'd expect from Taco Bell, I suppose. In fact, I liked it best on the turkey burger where it took advantage of the turkey's natural blandness to stand out some. The creamy texture is nice, but all in all, I pretty undistinguished addition to the condiment world. Not terribly bold or spicy, but it got the creamy part right. A safe bet if you're looking for something to put out for company you don't know very well. Perfectly edible and forgettable.",0
"Overall this brand is good but I think it is lacking in ""spicyness"" as they don't seem spicy at all. I don't , not like them but I just wish they had more ""sweet spicy"" flavor instead of more sweet. The package I got was a bit old I think as it was a bit dry but not inedible. Don't get me wrong, I love jerky but these could be better and maybe fresher. My only real complaint other than it's dryness is it just isn't spicy enough to be called spicy. I love peppered/spicy jerky and this really doesn't fully cut the mustard.",0
"The other reviews are correct that say these ""beefy sticks"" aren't to be confused with ""bully sticks"".  While this Smokehouse product has similar pricing to bully sticks, they simply aren't bully sticks.  They aren't long lasting at all.  Because of the high price of these beefy sticks and they're more of a quickly consumed treat rather than a long lasting chew, I took 2 stars off the rating.<br /><br />My 30 lbs sheltie girl ate hers in less than 3 minutes and she's a lady-like eater, not a gulper.  But both shelties of mine do enjoy these beefy sticks greatly, so it gets 3 stars for what it is, a treat or a very quick chew.  I just won't buy them again.  True bully sticks are the way to go if you want something that will occupy your furry chewer's time.  A really thick bully (I buy the full 36"" bully canes, otherwise known as ""walking sticks"") will take my kids nearly 2 hours of steady chewing to get a few inches off of it.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a quick chew that's rather expensive, these Smokehouse beefy sticks are just that.",0
"OK, I do love popcorn, but I'm definitely not in the gourmet category.  I'd been using a store brand white popcorn, but decided to try the ""gourmet"" variety to see what I had been missing.  I still pop the old fashioned stove top way, so consider that when you read the rest of this review.  I like the look of the various colors, the popcorn tastes quite good, is it better than my store version, I don't really think so.  What surprised me was that when popped, it makes about 1/2 as much as the store bought, so I have to use at least twice as much to get the same amount of popped popcorn.  So, all in all, I'm going back to the store brand and I'll save some money",0

"This cellar looks nice and works reasonably well, but when it arrived, the lid didn't fit properly on the glass below. I needed to bend the metal handle supporting the lid a little to get it to sit properly. It still doesn't fit perfectly, but it works ok.

"I was a little amazed that the product states to cook for 10 minutes. I have never known a navy bean to cook in 10 minutes.  My soup cooked for 50 minutes before the beans were done.

"Bottled sunshine is a beautiful idea. It strides the border between science fiction and Saturday morning cartoons. To think you could go to your grocery store and buy this or order cases of it online brings a smile to my face. But is Neurosun as a beverage the equal of Neurosun as a concept? The taste, which is that of a pina colada flavored Dum Dum pop is cloying. The effects, when compared to Neurogasm or Neurosleep are marginal at best. You feel good after drinking Neurosun and it has some things that your body needs, but it's one of the less useful Neuro drinks available. Bottled sunshine is a beautiful idea, but Neurosun is not really what you expect when you look for bottled sunshine.",0
"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.",0
"Guys: Although this doesn't pack the vitamin/mineral punch that Total has, this is a tasty, low fat cereal at a good price. Although it IS a processed food (processed rice, added sugar etc.), I like that it's not just  strawberry ""flavored"" bits or heavy yogurty-covered raisins and such.......it's real freeze-dried strawberries (ok, they're not fresh, but that's not a problem for me...I LOVE dried fruit in my cereal).  It's also a convenient way to get real strawberry taste in my cereal and it stays fresh.  It's one of my go to cereals out there. The only negative is that it's a tiny bit too sweet for me (it looks like they spray a very light sugar coating on the flakes, not like frosted flakes, but still not needed for my taste).<br /><br />It may not beat the sale price of boxed cereal at Costco or a discount supermarket outside NYC, but compared to typical boxed cereal prices in NYC, $3.39 per 16.7 oz box is a very good price (most brand cereal in a non-discount supermarkets here cost about $5.99/box, and they are rarely above 14 oz per box).",0
I ordered these because of the recommendations but I wasn't all that impressed.  The teas seem weak and rather flavorless to me...and the colors are not nearly as bright as pictured.,0
"Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count ""value"" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.",0

"I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.

Me and my wife liked this drink pretty good...It tasted very similar to the sparkling drinks you can buy that are non-alcoholic in Apple flavor...can't figure why it has a apple taste since it's not in the ingredients but it does.<br /><br />I would say this would be great as a special drink to have once every few days or so..but so far as drinking it every day all day....I wouldn't like it that much.,0
"First off, this product does NOT work like ephedra products do at ""burning fat"" - it just doesn't have the same effects on the body.  I knew that before purchasing...<br /><br />However, there are not any noticeable stimulant effects unless taken with caffeine (tea is what I used); this produces a combination that you can notice a slight increase in stimulant activity above what the caffeine alone provides.",0
"I loved the idea of this snack. As others mentioned, enough crunch and volume that it is hard to finish a bag. The flavors are not that great. I really like Honey Mustard and Onion flavored snacks but the smart fries, not so much. My six yr old loves snacks but not even the cheddar was appealing to her.",0
"I give this item 3 stars because I sent this package to a friend who lost her father. About a week later, after not getting a thank you (which is out of character for my friend) I reached out to see if she had received the package (very tacky), she said she had been wondering who sent it for days. I filled out the message that was supposed to be sent along with the package, but apparently it never got to her. I read that others had this problem in the reviews, but was hoping it had been fixed, but no it has not. She said she enjoyed the package, but it would have been nice to have my message go along with the package so I would not have to ask if she got it, which can be pretty awkward and tacky especially during such a touchy time. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAH13A"">Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Small With Heartfelt Sympathy</a>",0

"The dog and I disagree.  She loves it; I don't.  The title is misleading it states Grilled Sirloin, but it is based largely around soybeans, corn and wheat -- among the first few ingredients; this typical of most Purina products.  My vet has warned me about potential allergies like corn & wheat.  It also contains artificial colors, such as Yellow 6 and Red 40.  Artificial coloring this has been known to lead to bladder, and/or urinary track issues.<br /><br />Even when I fed her the recommended amount, 1 cup per 10 pounds, she seemed to remain hungry.  I don't recommend as a daily feed but, as a supplement - she gets to gobble it up & I don't have to worry about her nutrition or health.",0
"This bittersweet ""dark"" chocolate is unremarkable, but fine. I generally like dark chocolate at 80% or higher. These bars are 70% cacao. I think that is the minimum percentage to be called dark chocolate.<br /><br />It tastes similar to other chocolate bars with 70% cacao, so why pay more (and deal with the absurdly long name)?<br /><br />There isn't much more to say. It's just a barely-dark chocolate bar. If you want something more interesting, try their 68% bar from Papua New Guinea. That has a unique fruity flavor (without any fruit in it).",0
"Pretty good by the cat's standards, about 50% of them like it and 50% don't (we have rescue foster cats that come and go).",0
"As is, Cocoa D'Arriba consists of the best and natural ingredients only; no emulsifier, no artificial Vanillin. Concerning the high quality ingredients and business ethics, these are big pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />I recommend Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa instead, which is certainly a more successful product in the series. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar. It has more taste and after taste.",0
"So the first thing I noticed when I opened a can of this, that it is blue color, then the flavor.  I don't know what people like in it, but it just made me feel like I had been orally violated by Frosty the Snowman.",0
"This is a great product it grows very pretty, very quickly, but my kitty was not very fond of it.  Im not sure what it is, but she would rather eat the grass outside.",0
"The main virtue these bars have is that they are useful snacks that don't tempt me to eat them up when I don't need them.  Bites with dried cranberries (maybe 3 to a bar) in them taste good enough - otherwise they taste like puffed rice drowned in syrup, which is pretty much what they are.  I prefer almost any of the other gluten-free bars I've tried - Gluten-Free Cafe lemon sesame bars, Larabars (all of them - especially apple pie), Kind fruit and nut bars, etc.  But these aren't terrible - and unlike the other bars named, they don't tempt me to snack on them when I'm at home and other food is available, which means I have them available for road trips when I need them.",0
"Even though it says it's a medium roast, it's more mild and weak flavored. Would definitely have to use more pods to get better flavor. My son also tried it and used 2 pods for a 16 oz to go cup. He agreed it was weak but also commented that it had an odd flavor note to it.",0

"I bought this because I felt I wasn't getting enough vegetable in my diet at college, and I'm sure that it has done a terrific job stuffing my system full of nutrients, but I am always hesitant to take it because of a few reasons.  First of all, as I'm sure must be expected, this powder (when mixed with water, of course) has a god awful taste. Thankfully, the drink doesn't taste all too bad in the moment, but the aftertaste leaves you looking remarkably like a cat wheezing out a hairball. This might be due to the fact that the powder doesn't dissolve fully into the water, and instead all sifts down to the bottom of the glass, such that when you reach the end of the drink you're literally drinking a gritty green sludge (even if you stir vigorously and then drink it immediately). The only other reason that I have any qualms with this product, is because you're forced to use so much water to mix it into, that you overload your stomach with liquid and it sloshes about for a surprisingly long time. This always leaves me feeling nauseated, and I always end up burping excessively and having the fight the urge to vomit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy this product exists, but I wish there was some way to make it dissolve more effectively, or simply taste ever so slightly better. I've heard that mixing in a packet of Emergen-C does wonders for the taste, and I've also considered mixing the powder into something like apple juice to help the taste.  In any case, I'd still consider it a worthwhile product with just a few understandable drawbacks.",0
"Not quite the same as the cheese powder in your box of Kraft macaroni. This topping is a fine alternative to salt, but does not add a great deal of non-salt flavor. This is very similar in taste and texture to, for example, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAYJIU"">Reese Popcorn Salt</a>, which is finely pulverized table salt, but Kraft adds whey and powdered milk and a ton of orange coloring to make this salt seem more like cheese. It gives it a slightly sour taste, which might sound unpleasant, but actually does the trick beautifully compared to the much plainer ""salt with dye"" cheese sprinkles I've tried in the past. Still... If you're truly interested in cheese flavor, use finely grated <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264OMUM"">cheddar</a> (lightly sprinkled, it will melt like butter on piping hot popcorn) or go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001650XUK"">grated parmesan cheese</a> (or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E55Z46"">powdered version</a>, which, when sifted finely, makes the ultimate cheese topping, since it is, of course, actually cheese) for a fuller flavor. Another popular alternative, if you want to stick to powder, seems to be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016LZT8"">Barry Farms dried cheddar cheese</a>, although I have never tried it myself. :)",0

"These are okay.  The significance of these little wonder fruits is all about their ""power super fruit"" containing protein. They do not taste very good right out of the bag though.  Mixed in granola or cereal they are okay but not plain.",0
I did not realize that this was the price for ONE bottle.  That's my fault.  As a result I wouldn't purchase it again.,0
"I found these snack cakes to be extremely dense and unfilling. They also fall apart pretty easily. The moist, dense, unflavorful chocolate cake also sticks to everything including your fingers, so beware. Not even my kids liked these, and well, they like just about everything including brussels sprouts.<br /><br />What makes Oreo so great is the crunchy cookie and sweet white icing, but neither of those qualities have been replicated very well in this cake. If you truly want a snack cake stick to Hostess for the best quality, or Little Debbie for the best value.<br /><br />I hope Oreo can revise this snack, because Oreos are a great, timeless product that sell themselves. I don't think many people will be repeat buyers of this particular product, however.",0
"I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.",0
"This product tastes great, as one reviewer said it has a mild nutty flavor which adds a nice flavor to my smoothie, it can be a little gritty depending on how many tablespoons you add, but that doesnt bother me. The reason i knocked it 2 stars is with the 16oz container, 3 tablespoons is 11 grams of protein, and their is only 15 servings per container! For somebody like me who works out everyday and drinks a protein shake directly after workout, this is not the size nor the product for you, go with the hemp protein without fiber and 50% protein compound <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JU81ZG"">Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein 15G, 16 ounce canister</a> i recommend the 3lb bag,This 16 oz container might last me two weeks.",0
"I've purchased this product many times at the grocery store before and really liked the taste. The beans were small and dry (some reviewers said chalky, but I liked the taste) and did not have oily residue from the roasting. They were much crunchier and saltier. However, I just purchased this product on Amazon, opened the package and found that the beans were bigger and almost slimy from the canola oil. This was the complete opposite of the store-bought ones. Honestly, I'd stick to buying them at the grocery store because I don't like the oily taste of the ones that I bought from Amazon.",0
"Both of my finicky yorkies love this treat, but I don't!  It smells awful and I have to hold it for them to enjoy it, unlike other treats that I toss to them and let them enjoy while I enjoy a little peace and quiet.  Also, the liquid gets in their ""beard"" so the odor of the treat lingers even after I tuck the bottle back in the treat cupboard.  It is rare for both of my dogs to agree on a treat and it is fun to watch them enjoy it, but it is inconvenient.  I will not likely repurchase this.",0
"This is really tasty jerky and the price is right, but ~20-30% of the jerky strips in the bags I purchased contained some sort of ""gum-like"" inedible grissle that I end up spitting out.  I've bought 2 bags of this product approximately 30 days apart and both were like this.  I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.  It's a shame, because as I said, it really is tasty.<br /><br />UPDATE FEB 2010<br />OK ... I've kept my monthly subscription to this Jerky ...  What can I say ... Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ... I sort of look forward to the monthly delivery.",0
The concept of a portable food like this is great.  I think the servings should be closer to one ounce each and I wish they didn't have any added sugar.  Nonetheless a great alternative to some other sugary snack.,0
"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.<br /><br />He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning, though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks, and it came apart into twisted, jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.<br /><br />Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws, he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust, though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view, but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping.",0
I found these for 1/2 the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well. Makes a great gift :),0
"This isn't what you really expect bitters to be, though you can still use it. It doesn't have the added complexity that most bitters have, it tastes like just alcohol, sugar, and cherry without any bittering agents to balance it out at all. It's drinkable in over ice, it tastes more like a cheap schapps than anything else. I could see it being useful for desserts, which is why I bumped my rating up to 3 stars.",0
"I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist.",0

"These cookies are not bad but I expected more from Chips Ahoy. The reason I love their regular cookies so much is because they are crunchy. These are not, they are very soft and chewy and that is not a texture I love in a cookie. While these cookies aren't crunchy, the chocofudge in the middle is a nice and added treat. It would be nice if the original crunchy cookies had this middle and then they would have a homerun on their hands. As it stands, these cookies are just okay.",0

"I received my shipment of six bottles of this mustard in early January.  It is, in my opinion, the best mustard for a hotdog.  It really does make the hotdog taste like it has mustard and chili on it.  The problem is that my local grocer quit carrying it, so I had to move to Amazon.com to get it.  Another problem is that when you buy food items online, you can't inspect the product.  My case of mustard is due to expire in December of this year!  Now, I really like mustard, but I am unsure if I will be able to eat 63 ounces of it before Christmas.  I'm not sure if the chili seasoning has anything to do with the short expiration date or if I just got an old box.  In closing, let me just say again that this is the best hotdog mustard (assuming you like chili).  Give it a try, and if you get an old box, like I did, sell some of the bottles to your friends.  I'm selling some of mine for $2 apiece.",0
"I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.",0
"Based on reviews of the Weaver's French Roast Organic Coffee, I was looking forward to my first cup.  Sorry to say that I was disappointed.  I found the coffee to be ""thin,""  and not full-bodied although I used 4 heaping spoonfuls to 3 cups of water.<br /><br />I've been trying different brands of French Roast since First Colony went out of business and thus far have not found a replacement.  The Weavers was the 4th brand I've tried from Amazon and since there are lots more brands out there, I'm going to keep trying.",0
"They are edible. But wheres the promised flavor? I was a tad disappointed because while I understand candy is suppose to be sweet, these are just super sweet and no sign of anything else - the only two ways i can come up with to tell which flavor you're eating is to 1. check the label on the bag or 2. look at the color. although, be careful, the cherry and the strawberry are both similar tinge of red...good thing the shapes are different though. I truly wanted to like them...",0
Good taste - but at least 2 of the 12 boxes we received had some larvae growing - i.e. looks like fine webbing holding the rice together - had to toss it.,0
"I bought this tea as I had one of the Senseo machines.  I was a little disappointed that you need an extra tray for the machine in order to use them.  I think this is a poor design for the machine and is just more clutter in my house.  As for the tea itself, I never really used it in the Senseo machine because it really doesn't work right without the second tray.  I have used it as just a seep in a regular cup of hot water and it is fine.  Some other reviews said this is weak tea and I can see that if it is run through the machine.",0
"Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.",0
"There are now several varieties in the popular Kraft Macaroni and Cheese line.  This is a relatively expensive (per ounce) variety.  The selling point is that it is a healthy option, as the pasta incorporates reconstituted cauliflower.  Like the other varieties, it produces a tasty snack.<br /><br />Macaroni and Cheese (or just 'Macaroni Cheese', as the British say) is actually very easy to make.  You just boil the macaroni until it is soft and there is little water remaining, then add grated cheese, margarine or butter, and a little milk.  Stir it until the mixture has melted and is coating the pasta, and serve.  Black pepper tops it off nicely.  Using these packets is only slightly more convenient and a lot more expensive, plus you are getting heavily processed ingredients.  I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.<br /><br />Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.  Try adding a few florets into the macaroni when you boil it.  Then, whether you add your own sauce ingredients or use these packaged versions, you really will be getting a tastier, more nutritious meal.",0
"In the past a can of roast beef was really filled with roast beef; one had to pry it out with a fork. This product seems to be a minimal amount of roast beef and a maximal amount of brown gravy. As a point of curiosity I called Hormel and asked them about the small amount of beef and the large amount of gravy and was told that may have been the end of a production run and was short on beef.<br /><br />They sent me a coupon for a free can so I got the can and checked it out and found it was the same as before. There is some beef in there and it can taste good on rice or potatoes but just be prepared for the large amount of brown gravy.<br /><br />The taste is reasonably satisfying, especially if it is loaded up with pepper. It will probably take more than one can for a family meal.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer that it is a workable alternative for emergency use and can be eaten without cooking; it also has a good shelf life so that helps out.",0
"I came across Blk water as I was browsing the internet and was intrigued by its clever bottle slogan - ""Enjoy the Dark Side."" I decided to give it a try. I left the bottle in the fridge for a day after it arrived in the mail. It tastes just like clear water, no weird after taste. However, I still can't get my mind wrapped around the fact that it's ""dirty"" - not clear. Even though it tastes just like clear water to me, the color of the beverage plays a trick on my mind. ""If it's water, why isn't it clear?"" If you're considering purchasing this product, you should go ahead and do so. It's worth a try. After all, you'll never know if you really like it or not unless you try. Right?",0
"I ordered the 50-""dose"" Starbucks VIA coffee from Amazon rather than direct from Starbucks, saving money and getting fast, free  delivery. I like the Italian Roast, and recommend it.",0
"wow,this coffee packs a punch. The flavor is strong but not bitter like starbucks, and eat something when you when you drink it, two of my family members said it gave them an upset stomach.",0
"Recommended by the pediatrician for our 2-month-old as a supplement to breast milk. He was very colicky, getting up every 2 hours and crying nonstop. Within 24 hours of switching to this formula, he calmed down and stopped the crying.  This product is pricy compared to other regular formulas. We're constantly looking for sale or coupons and the cheapest price online. At the time, the seller - yl11219, had the best price and we needed the supply for a trip. Fortunately, we did not rely on the arrival of this supply because we never received a response from the seller regarding the order status, and finally took them more than 2 weeks to ship us the order.",0
Not rich enough.  I use four ounces of water to be drinkable. I like a much darker roast.  For regular coffee I like Starbucks French roast.  Does Starbucks not make a Dark roast decaf?.,0
"My dog loves these.  However, these are chewed up and swallowed up in about 5 seconds.  The chews of the same description/brand for medium and large dogs last a lot longer and my dog has to work on them for a long time.  These are good, they just aren't what I expecteed.",0
"This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . .  where is the mint!?  Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor.",0
I've eaten FRESH white peaches in the past. This is my first time tasting them canned. These taste more like canned pears; firm minus the grit texture. Actually I thought I had grabbed the wrong can from the pantry and went to the trash to verify these were actually peaches. Not sure I'd buy these again.,0
"I have had many different kinds of farina, but this one is thick! I keep experimenting with the amounts of water. Very paste like. Maybe needs more maple syrup?? =)",0
"This shampoo really cleans your hair- perhaps overly.  In the shower, after using this product, my hair feels stripped and straw-like.  I definitely put conditioner on every time I use this shampoo.  That said, afterwards (with the conditioner), my hair feels very light and clean.  I do not feel like there is any build-up in my hair.<br /><br />For me, I believe this shampoo is a bit strong.  However, I do not use any styling products such as mousse, or hairspray.  I think if I did, this would be a nice shampoo, as I am fairly confident it would strip all of that gunk from your hair.  Or if you have really oily hair, this might be a good shampoo to try.",0
"I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.<br />In hot humid weather it is also really hard to get them out of the wrapper. You can put them in the fridge for a while, but unless you are working on craft or cookery projects or run a store, don't buy in bulk in warmer months or if you live in warmer climates.",0
"I have tried may different coffees based on reviews fro Amazon.  Kicking Horse Dark is certainly not the worst (Three Peckered Billy Goat takes this honor).  On the other hand, it certainly isn't near the top of my favorites, either.  I would rank Kicking Horse on par with your run-of-the-mill Starbucks House Blend.  Neither is offensive, but also isn't anything special.<br /><br />That being said, no small part of taste in coffee is the 'taste' part; which is surely very personal and subjective.  For my money, though, Deadman's Reach is still the best I've found.",0
I'd eagerly awaited for delivery of this vanilla candy that I vividly remembered from childhood and was disappointed with this ersatz version of Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  It's not as rich and creamy in the mouth and doesn't have the real vanilla flavor that I recall in the original.  I would bet that the ingredients are not the same; for one thing soy is now used.,0
"I like the berry and lemon flavors of these better, the PB was soooo very sweet that I could only eat half with a cup of coffee.  This flavor is like a treat, not a meal replacement.  The Lemon Lift is best",0
This is the first time I tried Columbian coffee from GreenMountain. It is a good tasting medium bodied coffee and I would buy it again. 4 stars for taste.<br /><br />I subtracted one star for K-cup packaging. I have come across 3 K-cups so far that have either closed the water flow completely or allowed a very slow drip. My Kuerig has worked fine before and after those bad K-cups so I know it isn't my machine.,0
"This product gets 5 stars for taste and 1 star for the high sugar content. My son absolutely loves this product, and it smells delicious. I prefer healthier options for my kids. When I purchased it, I was hoping it was rice with a little peach flavor, but it's juice, sugar, and a little rice for texture. I appreciate that it's organic, and I will continue to give it to my son. It won't be a staple in his diet, only a treat.",0
"Honestly, I've tried very few rice pastas, but this one wouldn't win me over.  The texture was rough and grainy, even after 5 minutes of soaking in very hot water.  The directions said to warm them for 1 minute in ""warm"" water (no temperature indicated).  We did over 5 minutes in water at 120 degrees to no avail. The noodles were still pretty chewy and has a slightly grainy, raw-ish feel even heavily immersed in coconut milk broth.  Wouldn't buy again, especially for the price.",0
I bought a box of these at the store..got home..opened the box and there is 2 small snack size bags of crackers and this cost me 5 dollars!These companies really cheat people on this type of stuff cause they know people who have celiax have no choice..and poor people...people on disability...social security etc...it is hard to afford this high priced food and get a little amount for the price..,0
"To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.",0
"I am used to all types of water including tap water. If you weren't told otherwise, this water tastes 'normal'. However, if you tell someone that it is special water, then the person thinks that they can taste a slight difference. We'd need a blind taste test to figure that one out.<br /><br />This water though isn't about taste -- it is about the special properties of the water and what it can do for the drinker. For me I couldn't feel a major difference but I am not a power athlete nor do I think I have problems drinking other types of water. My mistake in reviewing this product is that I shared the water with my friends for their opinion instead of drinking it solid for a few days. Such a test may help me better understand if this water makes a true difference. It might be that the creators of this water intend for a person to drink this water over weeks/months to get the true benefits. If that is the case, this is just too expensive for me.",0
"I used this one to make a full gallon for a lot less than the stuff advertized here and it works. I have had no problems in my garden for the last month.<br /><br />Homemade Deer Repellent<br /><br />To make the homemade deer repellent mix the following with one gallon of water:<br /><br />  5 eggs (Blend them thoroughly if you'll be using a sprayer to avoid any clumps. You'll probably need to strain the mixture before using)<br />  1 cup of buttermilk, milk, or yogurt (think stink!)<br />  2 Tablespoons of hot sauce<br />  1 Teaspoon of liquid dish soap<br />  1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil<br />  15 drops of cinnamon oil - optional  This ingredient seems to be difficult to find but it is optional.<br />  2 Teaspoons of finely crushed garlic - optional<br /><br />Tip: Mix the ingredients in a blender with a quart of water first. Then combine the mixture with additional water. It will help keep your sprayer from plugging.<br /><br />This homemade deterrent is most effective when sprayed just before your buds appear, but can be used throughout the growing season. You'll want to change the ingredients occasionally. You can begin without the cinnamon oil and garlic in the mix. Add it later. Randomizing the bad tastes will help confuse the deer. Start in a small area to determine if the repellent is working before making large quantities is recommended.",0
"This product, Clear Scalp and Hair beauty therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil is not a product that I should use.  It left my scalp feeling itchy and my hair dank and nasty looking. I was a hot oiled greasy mess.  Most of the other reviewers seemed to like this product so I am worried somewhat that I have somehow used it incorrectly.  It smells wonderful and is easy to use; I just don't think I used it correctly.  The price is right; not too expensive. I wouldn't recommend it for hair as fine as mine; naturally curly hair would benefit from this product greatly.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",0
"I followed all the instructions and great guidance from this site, but my dog - a rescue dog, formerly an outside dog and not used to 'toys' didn't figure this out. Perhaps if another dog showed him the way, he'd get it. The product otherwise was well-made and a creative idea!",0
"Expecting a product similar to the tasty dried mango slices with chile seasoning, these pineapple bits are a disappointment.  They are coated with granular sugar, and what chile there is.....barely noticeable.  I am brushing off the excessive sugar and spicing the pieces with some salt-based Tajin Clasico seasoning and they are considerably improved.",0
"Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase.<br /><br />Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K-Cups weren't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage.<br /><br />I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again.",0
this isn't really what i was expecting. drank 4 cups and didn't feel anything. was thinking it would have the effects of green tea but didnt really do much.,0
"Good Product, just wish the click was a little louder, you have to look at the indicators to see if fence is charged, the click it makes can't be heard.  I would purchase again.",0
"First off, yes, this tastes pretty good. It's a nice blend of spicy pumpkiny flavors (though actual coffee taste is minimal), and there's a nice latte style head. It's creamy and delicious (and very sweet). But it doesn't dissolve very well -- you're going to have to work at it with a spoon for a while to get rid of the lumps. But you'll need the exercise to help kill the 60-calorie load, which, admittedly, is pretty minimal for something this yummy. My main complaint is the highly-touted ""lock-in fresh pack,"" which, in *my* pack, wasn't a very good lock, since very time I tilted the ""sealed"" container, some powder came out. Also, if I were a regular drinker of this coffee, I'd be concerned about the price. It's a great deal to pay for a product that is primarily sugar.",0
"I was excited to get these for homemade vanilla extract. The beans seemed good quality but there was ""fuzz"" on them! And I found what appeared to be a white dog/cat hair. I pictured someone holding them against their sweater while trying to get them in the bag. I obviously have no idea how they got fuzz on them but I was disappointed for that reason.",0
How about selling a six-pack or 12-pack instead of a 24-pack?  Mine had an expiration date about four months in the future; that wouldn't have been so bad (though it's still unreasonable for a high-volume merchant like Amazon) if I had been able to purchase a smaller quantity.,0
"This tea has a really bad taste to it, bought it for weight loss, it didn't help. had all the other teas dr oz recommended too. no weight loss, in fact i think i gained weight while drinking teas all through the day as suggested by dr oz. but you have to remember that caffeine makes your pancreas put out more insulin which in turn makes you hungry :(",0
"I normally buy the organic version, but since they were out of stock, I ordered these.  They taste as good as they normally do, but the ingredients are not the same as listed.  They are: wholegrain oats, sunflower oil, palm oil, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate: raising agent, natural flavouring.  I normally avoid anything that says natural flavoring and wouldn't have bought these it that were listed on the page.",0

"If you just want good-tasting dried onions, then you might give this product 5 stars.  These dried onions taste as good as potato chips [organic, no salt added] and you would be willing to eat this product by itself without any other food.  However, I'm very concerned that the healthful phytochemicals in these onions have been severely damaged and mostly lost.  The ""sting"" in these onions is completely missing, indicating to me that Frontier either used ""sweet"" white onions deprived of sulfur instead of the organosulfur-rich regular white onions - or - Frontier dried regular white onions in a way that destroys too much of the highly beneficial phytochemicals.  The fact that the product we actually receive has been chopped up too finely instead of the nice, large chunks that we see in the photo also increases the odds that the healthfulness has been damaged.",0
"This product was not as flavorful as I had expected.  The only flavors of the variety pack that I really liked were the jalepeno and the honey mustard and onion.  Two flavors I would not ordinarily enjoy. For the cost, I would not purchase again.",0
This set must have been on their shelves MUCH TOO LONG!  The taste of this coffee wasn't good!  I've had much better Island Coconut coffee!  Direct from Vermont might have to be my best option!!,0
This dog food was so well liked by the dogs that they wouldn't stop eating. I never had this problem with Purina Dog Chow.  I actually had to regulate their portions because the dogs wouldn't stop eating it.  I can only assume that this stuff is loaded with something sweet to make these dogs act like this??  I eventually mixed it into their Dog Chow and I won't be purchasing anymore because of their love of this dog food.,0
"On the can, it states that its lemon juice is from concentrate - and it tastes like it is.  I dunno if you have ever sucked on the lemon juice in the fake lemon from the grocery store as a child, but it tastes just like that.  I think - in my own personal opinion - that I am better served taking plain pelligrino water with a squirt of fresh lime.  This BTW also has 140 calories per can.  More than a coke or pepsi.",0
"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs.  The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!!  But, there was way too much unpopped corn.  We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought.  The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!",0
"I had not realized until just now that these FERRERO ROCHER HAZELNUT CHOCOLATES 48 COUNT GIFT BOX, were made by the SAME Ferrero Company that makes ""Nutella"" Hazelnut-Chocolate spread, (which I totally love to eat!)  I had some of these individual chocolates once, and did NOT like them!  Those who share my taste in chocolates will not like them either!  For these Ferraro Rochet Hazelenut<br />Choclolates, have bits of hazel nuts, (finely chopped...but NOT finely chopped enough for me), embedded in a chocolate coating, the whole surrounding a whole hazelnut.  I'm one of those people who likes FILETS....boneless fish filets, boneless chicken filets, etc.  I, (and I know I'm NOT alone here), like my chocolate mixtures to be complete MIXTURES....like Nutella spread, (or ""figaro"" hazelnut chocolate pieces...also called ""chocolate truffles"").  Biting through<br />hard, embedded ""pieces"" of things -- even such tiny pieces of hazelnut as the chocolate-hazelnut coating has here -- is NOT for me, or others like me.  In this, I have discovered, I, (or make that, ""we""), have true ""preppy"" tastes, (even though I did attend plain old Queens College in NYC -- part of the very public<br />City University of New York where, it seems, (to me, at least), egalitarian has gone from good to exremes -- and even fraternities and sororities are officially outlawed!  To some, this may seem only ""fair"" and ""equitable"".  But to status-seeking me, it seems SO unglamourous!  I guess I'm not the typical Queens College of the City University of New York student, though I do sincerely laud them for making eduction more available for everyone.  I only wish they had more of what private universities have.  To me, ""equality"" is equal luxuries for all, not equal utilitarianism for all.  Same goal, different methods, I guess....)  In ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", it states that preppies like filets...no bones to slice through, or fat to trim away. (Why waste the time, why spend the effort?)  The same has to go, (at least for me --and others with ""preppy"" tastes), for these otherwise ""gourmet"" quality confections.  Those little bits of chopped hazelnuts in the coating -- not to mention the BIG hazelnut in the centre -- make eating DIFFICULT, and spoil the pleasure of eating. Rather than have a (fancy) chocolate that I must chew through, I would prefer a plain old Hershey choclate bar. It, like the more expensive Nutella, IS a chocolate ""filet"".  I suppose this liking of the ""ordinary"" Hershey bar, (and a plain one please -- not one with almonds),  proves I am NOT a snob -- I, (and others like me), simply have TASTE!<br /><br />I thought I was alone in this.  But since reading ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", I know that others -- far richer than myself -- also have these tastes.  This, of course, vindicates me, and I feel glad of it.<br />Enjoy ""Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 Count Gift Box"" if you wish...and give it to friends, if that is your desire. But this sort of chocolate, because of the way it is formed, is NOT my choice for either myself or my friends.  And, no matter how excellent the chocolate itself is, it will NEVER be of ""gourmet"" quality, to me!",0
"We decided to buy this carousel rather than the one made by It because it held more (35 vs. 27) and because it was taller and narrower, thereby taking up a smaller footprint. The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the It version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons. However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the ""leaning tower"" rotates annoyingly from side to side. Decided to live with it rather than dealing with a return.",0

I am not paid for this review. When I took my first bite my first impression was that the Bunny Bar was sweet. I did not like the texture, it was nether crunchy or soft, but kinda hard to chew. I could taste a bit of cherry, but not a hole lot which is not good in my opinion. The chocolate didn't seem to be of a very good quality, but it might be because it was semi melted due to the extreme heat we have right now in CA.",0
"A vaguely recognizable Guinness flavor with a slightly sweet, thin finish... Frankly, I'd rather just drink a regular Guinness.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, this is a gimmick beer.

"Ingredients: sweet potato, carrots, broccoli, celery, apples, whole egg, tricalcium phosphate, flax meal, parsley leaf, carob powder, dried kelp, dried alfalfa, ginger root, garlic, vitamin D3.<br /><br />The ingredient list was not on the Amazon product page so when I ordered it I thought it consisted only of dehydrated fruits and veggies.

My dog is on a low-fat Vegetarian diet to control her cholesterol levels and allergies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000634HD2"">Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula Dog Food, 28-Pound Bag</a>.  I thought of adding this mix-in to make her meals more palatable.  While Sojos is a tasty and natural mix-in that helps my little carnivore miss her meat less, I was disappointed to learn that it has these ingredients in it:<br />1- EGG - is highly allergenic. My dog is allergic to poultry and since this is a poultry product, I'd rather not have this in the formula.<br />2- GARLIC - published as a substance that is toxic to dogs.  My references:  both the ASPCA web site, and the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813819857"">Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology</a>.  I am including a very short excerpt from the book, ""The Allium species of plants belongs to the Alliacae family and includes onions, garlic, chives, and leeks.  These plants contain propyl disulfides and can cause Heinz body anemia when ingested by companion animals.  Cooking, drying, processing, and spoiling do not negate the toxic effect.  Pets on diets with Allium supplementation (e.g. garlic or onion powder) may be chronically poisoned.""  Detailed info on pages 457-460.  When I learned this, I quickly stopped feeding my dog this product.  This didn't come cheap and that also adds to my disappointment because now it will have to be thrown out.<br /><br />If the manufacturer changes the formula and removes those two ingredients, I might consider buying this product again.",0
"I love the quality and especially the variety of flavors of coffee they are offering. The bad part is that it is too expensive on Amazon! I bought it the first time from Amazon and it ended up costing me close to $1/shot. Now I'm using Nespresso's website and the best part, they have an App for phone that is really easy to use!!!",0
End product was kind of a surprise. Less seems to be more with this tea. Gave me major heartburn and this is highly unusual in my life.,0

"The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money.",0
"This is a pleasant balsamic, but only that. It has a pronounced flavor profile that begins enjoyably enough, but becomes reminiscent of molasses or burnt caramel. I wonder at the methods used to create it's silkiness and body, especially given its youthful age. As another reviewer mentioned, it tastes cooked. It's a decent balsamic, there are simply better choices available for the price.",0
Husband was disappointed with this product.  Was a little too soupy and not enough seasoning. Had to doctor it up quite a bit.,0
"I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local ""healthy supermarket,"" and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.",0
"I bought these at a specialty store before ordering them from amazon.  They did not contain milk at that time.  I loved them, and decided to order a case.  Milk, as of the writing of this review, is still not listed as an ingredient on this website.  There are stickers over the ingredients, which include milk powder.  I called the company and was told the recipe had changed.  They were very nice and offered a refund.  Unfortunately, we opened one and ate some before I noticed the sticker.<br /><br />Even if you don't mind the milk, please be aware that they will arrive in crushed bits, not in wafer rolls.",0

"I wasn't happy with this product unless it was made with real eggs, then it was still a bit dense and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer Bob's Red Mill's awesome chocolate cake.  Both benefit from mixing in some extra vanilla.  So, not to be avoided, but I don't use it much.",0
"Our dog loves this stuff. I bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food, I thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then. But this stuff stinks really bad like dirt, it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house. If they could improve the smell of it, that would be awesome, because our dog just loves it but we can't bare the smell of it.",0

"Since I read the reviews on the""Brooklyn"" brand of K-cups for Keurig, and how they exploded in the machines of users, I was very skeptical to even try the four that I found included in my sampler pack. I just tossed them because having to clean my entire machine due to such mishap is certainly not worth it.  As such, I lost out on 4 of my coffees.  I am surprised that Amazon would still include them after such poor reviews.<br />I will certainly not order this item ever again, and maybe anyone else should think twice as well!! As for the rest they were fine but coffee is too expensive to be losing money on 4 cups I did not get to enjoy!",0
"Item is too expensive, better buy it at the grocery store. Flavor is great, but not the sellers price. Usualy Kmart, Walmart and Walgreens carry it and many supermarkets too.",0

"I make my daughter's yogurt since the only whole fat yogurt available in stores where we live is Stonyfield's, and they're almost $1/cup. The recipe uses 3c. whole milk and a cup of dry milk, which sent me on a search for a dry milk that was more nutricious than the plain old nonfat dry milk that most places carry. Nestle Nido Kinder was my answer: I like that it's fortified with so many nutrients that growing kids need, fiber was a huge plus since my daughter sometimes has regularity problems, essential fatty acids, and the taste is really good. My daughter also likes it mixed as a drink as well, and since it taste slightly different than regular milk, it's a nice change every once in awhile. I compared this to toddler formulas that are out there, and this has just as much nutrients for more than half the price (with S&S discount 30.7cents/oz. and Similac Go&Grow toddler formula is 76cents/oz. on Amazon). I've also purchased Walmart's version of Pediasure before I discovered Nestle Kinder, and they're also nutrient comparable, but Kinder is WAY cheaper than even a generic pediasure (it cost $1.31/8oz. bottle and an 8oz sippy of Kinder made with nursery water cost 40.6cents to make). I highly recommend trying this with your toddler if you're looking for something to supplement your child's diet that is also budget friendly.<br /><br />***Update from two years ago when I made this review: The price more than doubled! I was paying $13 for this 3.52lb. can with Subcribe&Save. I love the product still, HATE THE PRICE!!! I'm sorry, but I'm sure not making almost triple what I was so I sure can't afford to pay that much for the same product.***",0
"So, the nutritional properties of Beneful are there for you to decide of your own volition, but as for a dog food my dogs like, this is it. I mixed it with Taste of the Wild which is grain free (and the mixture might be seen as sacrilege for the purists), but the dogs enjoyed it solo and in the mixture. I do notice they eat it by color though. The red kibble bits go first. Actually one dog loves the red kibble bits so much she dumps the whole bowl to get the red ones. Then goes the green, and finally the brown bits. Not sure what that is about, but it seems to be pretty standard by now. She actually started to growl when the other dogs came to eat before she was done with the red bits.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and can be zipped closed, which I appreciate. The kibble size is relatively small, so for my mini doxies, it is pretty perfect. My sister's yellow lab came by, though, and I am fairly certain he didn't even have to chew- just inhaled and the bowl was empty. So I think this food is fine, but nutritionally questionable...",0
"At $7,099.00, this is, no doubt, an expensive product. But try it once and you'll agree: this particular chicken noodle soup is worth every one of your hard-earned dollars.  Also, since it is low sodium, it's relatively guilt-free!",0
"I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now.

"This product was inexpensive, shipped quickly, and performed as expected.<br /><br />I would, however, have liked to know that it is DYED orange. I don't know if that would have precluded my purchase.",0
"Peanuts have good taste, but were not the jumbo size I expected.  The peanuts were fresh in the can just not the size I thought was advertised on the can.",0
"I was so excited to get this curry paste. The flavor was good if you can get past the heat. Wow, it is hot. My boyfriend goes to Thai resturants and orders Thai hot and then asks for some more hot sauce. He even said it was hot. The next time I make it I'll try adding less paste and additional coconut milk.",0
this is a nice green tea with a citrus flavor but it has not chi flavor at all.  i don't know what was in the bag labeled as chi but thats not what we got!!!!!,0
This is really good stuff if its cocoa you want. I didnt really taste coffee at all..I found that if I make a 6oz cup of regular coffee first then add a 6oz cup of this stuff it makes the perfect 12oz cup of mocha coffee. still good as cocoa in the evening too.....Its dual purpose!!!!,0
"From crazzeto's wife:<br />My baby developed a milk intolerance and very bad acid reflux around 2 months so we had to switch from breastmilk to Nutramigen and she HATED it. We had to flavor every bottle with expensive vanilla powder just to get her to drink it, and she still had a lot of pain and feeding difficulties. It's also three or four times more expensive than other types of formula, and honestly I think it is mostly because the company knows that if your baby needs it this is your only option and will have to pay whatever price they give you. We ended up switching to Similac Sensitive after a while and although she had more reactions to it, at least she would actually drink it and gain weight (unlike with this stuff) and it was cheaper too.",0
"With the purchase of a new single-serve coffee brewer, I was looking to enhance the java experience by finding a proper chocolate addition.  My research led to me to sauces rather than syrups and I opted to try a product by Torani, an already trusted name in coffee products.  Sadly, I haven't found Torani's Original Mocha Sauce to be all that bold or flavorful.  In fact, though I'll continue to use the bottles I've purchased, I won't be buying this same product again.",0
"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!",0
"I bought one of these at a store and thought I would order a box of the Peanut Butter-Dark Chocolate Protein online. I am not sure if it is the heat of the summer or off batches but the last two 12 packs I have ordered have been in date but as hard as rock. Not like the individual one I bought in the store. Also, it is a delicious bar and barely impacts my blood sugar so makes a great on-the-run snack.  Note: I don't taste the peanut butter at all. I like peanut butter so was a bar disappointed but the bars are still tasty.",0
"Our baby eats the other flavors of the Sprout Baby Food, but not this one.  I do wish that they made more flavors with a little bit more protein in them.  This one and the sweet potato and white bean flavor (which our baby does eat) seem to have a good serving of protein. These are one of the only prepared baby foods that do not have BPA in the container. The glass jarred baby foods have BPA in the lids, even the organic brands. It comes in a BPA free pouch, which is resealable, recyclable, and very portable.  I do highly recommend all of the other level 2 flavors. This review is 100% independent and non-compensated for in any way.",0
"This flavor is light and refreshing; however, it doesn't hold a candle to the premixed ""skinny"" margarita mixers available in the grocery store (e.g., Jose Cuervo, Mix Masters, etc.). In fact, the Crystal Light margarita mix really doesn't taste like a margarita at all to me.  I was able to mix it half and half with one of the premixed mixers and the flavor was close enough, so I guess you might be able to spend a little less on your margaritas by extending your mixers with the Crystal Light, if you're on a really super tight budget.  Otherwise, I would buy it only as a refreshing alternative to the other standard Crystal Light flavors. The flavor is not tart like lemonade..just kind of smooth and refreshing. Not sure how else to describe it.",0
I bought the black pudding thinking it would be as tasty as what I eat when I go to Canada. The pudding had the same consistancy but it was bland. If it had a little more spices I would give it a 5 star.<br /><br />I will buy it again. It is the only Black pudding that I can get in the USA.,0
"I have tried several of Annnie Chun's and have been pretty satisfied, but this one has a sauce that is overly sweet for my taste.  The noodles are great and it makes for a quick meal, but I would recommend a different flavor or try the noodle soups by Annie Chun",0
"I much prefer artichoke hearts, but I ordered the artichoke bottoms because my husband ""thinks"" he doesn't like the artichoke hearts and this is one way to include healthy,  beneficial artichokes in salads, omelets, etc.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, it is the same very good quality that we have found in all of the Roland products we have ordered.",0
Nicely packaged. Plenty of olives but they are very mushy. Ok to cook with but you can not serve them straight out of the refrigerator to guests.,0
"This Spanish ""paprika"" has the beautiful red color of Hungarian paprika, but not its unassuming flavor. This Spanish version, pimenton, has a pronounced smoky flavor. It's going to be interesting to find new ways to use it.",0
I love the strong scent of this tea and it tingles my throat after I have myself a sip. It could've have been better if this tea had more sweetness of an apple because it is rather bitter. I'm not too sure if I would buy this flavour of celestial tea but I certainly enjoyed other ones.,0
"I'll say right off the bat that I am not a big fan of the alcoholic version of Mojitos.  I enjoy one every now and then if I am with friends who happen to be making them, but it isn't my first choice for a cool down drink with a kick (that would be Firefly Iced Tea).<br /><br />Hoping that I would find a decent alternative to the real deal, I picked up Crystal Light's Moctail Mojito drink mix.  Like similar drinks in this line, the Mojito mix is very easy to prepare.  Simply add one packet to two quarts of water, mix, serve over ice and you're ready to relax.<br /><br />When I made the mix, I was a bit taken aback by the somewhat bitter taste.  With lime flavoring as a primary ingredient, I expected some bitterness, but not this much.  I also noticed that the minty taste that accompanies your standard Mojito was lacking in this virgin mix.<br /><br />While the Appletini mix in this Crystal Light line doesn't have the standard ""fake sugar"" aftertaste that you find in most Crystal Light products, it is very apparent in the Mojito mix.<br /><br />In the end, I'd say that the Crystal Light Moctails Mojito mix is good for a quick, five calorie refreshment if you want something other than water, but it pales in comparison to the Appletini mix for overall flavor.<br /><br />Give it a try for yourself, but don't expect to be wowed.",0
"Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.  The K-Cups still brew a decent cup of tea, although as you cannot control the steepage the tea comes out on the weak side for me.  While still tasty, the much greater expense ($0.45/cup vs less than half that for teabags) for the convenience may not add up for a lot of people. However, if you're go-go-go in the morning and don't have time it may be worthwhile.  I myself will be going back to teabags but will still use the Keurig to get fast hot water!  Best of both worlds!",0
"Frankly, the flavor is nothing special.  There is no overtone of any Kahlua influence.  Dom Francisco vanilla nut, and hazelnut are just as good, if not better, at half the price.",0
"I've never been terribly impressed by Godiva chocolate, but after AOL taste tested hot cocoas and said that most are essentially sweet, brown water, I thought I would give highly-rated Godiva Hot Cocoa a try.  I guess it's better than the packet mixes like Swiss Miss, but I think NesQuik mixed in hot milk would be just as good and much cheaper.",0
"The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++",0
I have been using the agave for years and i must report that it hav changed> it is much thinner and not as sweet so you must use more.,0
"I bought a couple of packs of the decaf and the expiration date was further out to March 2013.  When Starbucks has them (all flavors) on sale for around $25 shipped, I bought a pack of the Italian Roast.  I was disappointed that this package received will expired November 27, 2012.  I was hope to have a further date because I don't drink them everyday.  Emailed Starbucks and they said products still good 75 days past expiration date and if I don't want it, return for full refund.  Amazon do not have a return policy on food items and Starbucks didn't offer to refund my shipping this item back to them.  I just have to take their words for it and keep the package.  Sending it back at my expense isn't worth the hassle.<br /><br />I think I shouldn't worry about expiration dates so close but if Starbucks drop the prices, you know they're getting rid of expire soon coffees.  I probably buy at local Costco next time.",0
"My whole family loves these so I put them on my subscribe and save list.  We were thrilled to get the first shipment, but then my husband noticed that they are manufactured in China.  No thanks.",0
"After reading previous reviews, I ordered these gumballs.  I found that some of the gumballs tasted funny and all of the gum became hard to chew and stale after a couple minutes.  Not terrible, but you can find better, like double bubble.",0
"I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local ""healthy supermarket,"" and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.",0
I bought this to fit in with my high protein hig fiber low carb diet.  They do taste great and I would give them 5 stars if they didn't include the following: THis product contains SODIUM ERYTHORBATE and SODIUM NITRATES.  These 2 substances have awful side effects up to and including DNA damage...If they were all natural I would buy again but these substances are terrible for your health...If you don't believe me you should google both of them...If this does not concern you then by all means you should check them out as they taste pretty good but I won't be re-purchasing them any time soon...,0

"i love these freeze-dried strawberries.  my toddler loves them too.  but unless you're going to feed a small army, the bulk size container should last you a couple of weeks, right?  well, the tub seems to be airtight, but the strawberries get soft and ""stale"" pretty quickly.  great strawberries, not-so-great packaging.",0
My dog loves the bones but they seem to splinter more than some other bones. Just have to keep an eye out,0
"Coffee itself was good enough but after ordering on the subscribe and save, I just got notification that my next delivery would be shipping soon. The price was raised and I got no other notification of that fact. I think that something should have been sent asking if I'd want to pay the higher price, which of course I don't. At least I'm not sleeping, Amazon, and still have time to cancel. Just a nasty way to do business.",0
the candy itself was a hit. although the quality after being shipped was not. the wax bottles had melted into on another causing one big clump of wax candy....not so great,0
"Hey they are chips, you want me to say they taste like chicken?? They showed up on time in good condition!",0
"I bought these because I'd never seen this flavor at my local stores but I liked the flavors I had tried.  This flavor had way too many onions.  I ended up pouring the vegetable packet into a bowl and fishing out most of the onions before adding it to the soup.  I like onions, but there are just too many.  I will stick to the regular chicken flavor from now on.",0
"I went online to find the Zico Passion Fruit coconut water and found that amazon had it for the cheapest price. afte trying the regular, passion fruit and mango I would have to say the regular is my favorite, mango second and the passion fruit last. the passion fruit just didnt taste very good to me and had a defining artificial taste.",0
"Nothing fabulous; very salty. Weird aftertaste after eating a bunch of them made them less appetizing. I won't be going out of my way to get them, but I didn't toss them out either.",0
"We sent these as a Christmas gift to family.  Unfortunately, from the response we received ...not at all impressed... the cookies and box were not quite up to what was shown in the picture.  It didn't make us feel very good and I don't think we will be using them again in the future unfortunately.",0
"I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.  Then, when he was 9 months old, about 4 months after receiving the product, I decided to try it again, as he was at that age where he knows he should come when called, but is a bit defiant about it.  By then, the stuff in the bottle had gotten a bit thick, and the roller didn't work too well.  I used it a little anyway, just forcing the ball to roll with my finger, but I then left it in my coat pocket, and when I wasn't paying attention, Archie bit into the pocket and crushed the bottle and it oozed out inside my pocket - arghh!  Not the product's fault, obviously.  It could definitely work, but I think I will just stick with the old standard kibbles in a plastic bag for now anyway.",0
"The Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookies do not have a ""cream center"".  The center is a vanilla-flavored hard sugar disc.  The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase.",0
To get the flavor of Mudslide you can't make a large cup of coffee or it is just too weak....but tasty in the smallest cup size or one up from that.,0
"My family has four dachshunds and they all gobbled up these treats. One of my dachshunds developed an allergy to these treats after I went through 2 bags. He got hives and this throat swelled up. We caught it fast and got him to the vet. He had to take benadryl  for a few days. He's just fine now, but I can't risk feeding my dogs these treats anymore.<br /><br />Before anyone questions, I know they were these treats because he had one small reaction before the big one. The big reaction was right after I fed one of these treats and  he had no other treats as these were the only ones that I had on hand.",0
"I bought this 24-Count box of Extreme Berries over six months ago to liven up bottled water for my long stays on campus. I didn't really consider the purported health benefits and I think I snagged them when they were discounted. The first time I mixed some up I noted the taste was unusual in some way but also picked up on its ""natural"" flavoring. I'm not implying it's not naturally flavored, but that the flavor tasted natural, which is a good thing. Even at a discount they weren't exactly cheap either so I really wanted to like them. But 6 months later I have more than half left and I rarely finish them once I've mixed them up. I typically get through about 3/4ths of it and then I can't really stand the taste anymore. Now part of the problem is they may have aged and the ingredients may have deteriorated without the demonized preservatives I presume they excluded. But now it tastes, if it didn't always, like strawberry chalk. If it was the only sweet thing I ever allowed myself to have, it probably would taste pretty good. But now it kind of tastes like a bunch of ground up sweet tarts suspended in water without the sugar. Now that I've picked out this chalkiness it seems very distinct and I just can't enjoy it anymore. Now considering all the good stuff its supposed to have in it, and the ingredient list does seem to impress, it's important to be fair. This is a health food (dietary supplement as it says on the box) and that wasn't really what I was looking for. It's not the worst tasting of that kind of product I've ever had and all I can really say is that in that regard it meets expectations.<br /><br />Note that it is sweetened with stevia if that interests you. Really this is all about the antioxidant blend. I don't know what competition is out there but I can say the other means of imbibing the antioxidants in this seem to me like a far less palatable endeavor.",0
"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.",0
The braided bully sticks were a bit thin and loosely woven together. In my case this is exactly what I wanted as I have two small bichon frise dogs. To give them a whole would be too much. I cut them in thirds and unravel the  braid easily. This way each dog gets a portion to chomp on.,0
"Not to be compared with the other brand named products.  They are good, but the layer of yogurt is thinner.  Also keep in mind you'll find a lot of seeds in the raisins.  So for people getting these for sensitive teeth better get the brand names.  I have no issue with flavor they taste delicious still.",0
I was planning on separating this into 5 separate gift baskets but the tea bags do not have their own individual paper wrapper so I had to make labels for them.  Otherwise it's great tea.,0

"I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box.  If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.",0
"I am used to strong coffee, so few coffees work for me. Starbucks usually are strong in flavor and stimulation effect except breakfast blend (I'm talking about Tassimo ones), Verona though didn't work for me because the taste was bitter and sour, it was strong and kept me alert most of the day more than other coffees, but I did not like the bitter taste, I prefer the medium version.<br />I also think it is expensive for home made coffee. I would give 4.5 stars to the medium versions; strong, taste good, stimulating without the bitterness flavor. I also like Seattle henry blend from tassimo, tastes good, cheaper not as strong though, I intensify the flavor by stopping the brewing cycle before the flushing. it does the job.",0
"I have enjoyed this tea for some time, and as I am British, I know my tea. I highly recommend the tea.<br /><br />I usually buy this at World Market (Cost Plus), and they used to sell it at about $4.99 for the 80 bag size.  My local store is currently out of stock as I believe Williamson Teas in the UK are changing the packaging (and perhaps the price?).  Anyway, you can see that this is not a good deal even if the shipping was free, but these people (not Amazon) charge over $10 to ship from FL. USPS Priority Mail is $5.55 across the country for a 1 lb package (package of 80 tea bags plus packing is &lt; 1 lb.). Outrageous! - they are marking up their shipping as well as the tea!  Most of their (again not Amazon) other British products are also over-priced.<br /><br />I recommend you look elsewhere.",0
"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.",0
"Lavender Matcha!!  What could be better?  This matcha smells of soft lavender - reminding me of being out in a field of lavender.<br />My first impression of this matcha... I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I wanted to put this in a sachet under my pillow and have sweet lavender dreams.  I cannot get enough of that soothing lavender scent.  I had thought that this might be a good soothing matcha before bed.  I'm tempted to make a facial mask from it!<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with about 3/4 perfect teaspoon of matcha. I held back on adding a full teaspoon until I knew how strong it would be.  Once that was properly mixed I added a bit of sugar (sorry, can't do without a touch of it) and 7 oz of water.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water stayed the same, a robust lavender.  The quality of the actual matcha is very good.  This is definitely one you need to try for yourself.<br />I'm going to play around with this more.  A latte might not be the best route for lavender but iced might.<br />To try Lavender Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]",0
"Organic, natural foods should taste great and be satisfying. While these bars are very healthy for you, they taste too grainy and heavy. Eating them makes one happy for trying to eat healthy foods, but they honestly do not taste that great and it's a bit of a chore to finish even one bar. I wish that there was more fruit flavor in the bars because the fiber taste seems to overtake the fruit flavor.",0
My dog doesnt like the flavor of the duck but loves the peanut butter.  I was shocked because she loves duck dog food.  I gave them to my girlfriend and her dog loves them.  My dog is super pickey and somewhat of a treat perfectionist!  She is spoiled I will admit it.,0
"I got these, thinking that they'd be a good healthy snack, and they do indeed taste pretty good. But they are way too oily. I expected them to be more like Veggie Chips, which I really like. But they aren't.<br /><br />Hey, they might be healthy but it doesn't matter. They leave a greasy residue in your mouth/throat after eating just a handful of them. Just as bad as french fries.",0
Tasty but too tasty?  Too much like candy for my purposes.  If you are on a diet you might like these bars too much and find you want more than one...,0
"Trolli Eggs are sooo good. They only sell these at certain markets so I was excited to see that Amazon was selling a pack of 12 at a lower cost. The cost of trolli eggs are increasing. I remember it was always $1.00 at Stater Brothers, but now it's about $1.50. This was actually a gift for a friend who is in love with this candy. It was supposed to come with 12 as advertised, but there was only 10 in the package. BOOO! Minus 2 stars for 2 missing.",0
"I am torn on this product because my dog LOVES it and it keeps her occupied for hours, but it is really smelly. Worse then any bully sticks I have bought.

"What I bought is not what I got!  I thought I was getting Decaf and it isn't.  The shrink wrap on the outside labeled it as Decaf but it was regular roast coffee!  If you have to drink Decaf, be wary!  Luckily my husband drinks regular coffee and he can use this but I was really disappointed that it wasn't Decaf.  I had one cup and was pretty hopped up.  I can't drink regular coffee because of my thyroid disease so it was a tad unnerving.",0
"It seems like I am brewing sweet iced tea every other day.  Being from the South I grew up on iced tea and was hopeful that this MIO Sweet Tea would allow me a quick alternative for a glass of tea if I didn't have time to brew some.  However, it fell short for a few reasons.  First, make sure you are aiming down into your glass because a little squeeze makes a strong stream and the first time I used it I ended up spraying it 4 feet away onto my newly redone white kitchen cabinets and it wasn't that easy to clean off.  It didn't stain, it just spread.  So aim carefully.  Secondly, I felt like it didn't taste anything like brewed tea.  I kept adding more hoping to get some tea-like flavor but never acheived it.  Lastly, all I could taste was sweetness to the point I thing I could have gotten the same flavor just adding a sweetener to plain old water.  So overall, I don't see the point of this particular flavor.  I did once try the strawberry-watermelon flavor and found it lite and refreshing, so there are good flavors out there but this Sweet Tea flavor just couldn't reproduce the tea flavor for an avid tea drinker like myself.",0
"It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!",0
"In a nutshell, I find Lavazza in Blu Espresso to be too mild and a little too 'mocha' tasting.  My long time favorite <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8"">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> is smooth, Italian espresso, not too light, and not too deep with a very nice espresso taste.",0
"Hubby is the coffee drinker around here.  He likes Starbucks in general but he said this Vanilla coffee just isn't ""that vanilly"".  Not really a word, I know, but that was what he said.  He likes his regular coffee strong so that could be the issue here but he said there's not a chance he'd buy it.  He really likes another brand, I believe it's ""Melitta""? Vanilla coffee.  If you're a coffee drinker you probably know what brand I'm talking about there.  He said this Starbucks doesn't even come close to that.",0

"We get these all the time and my husband really likes them, however, this last package has been void of strawberries...Was something wrong with a batch that didn't get caught at the factory??",0
"The flavor is great, but it lasts a depressingly short while. The hard case makes it easy to bring some with you all the time, great for sharing with bros. I bought this to fill the $25 requirement for free shipping, next time that happens I'll try something else, just because of the short flavor life.",0
"Has anyone noticed a different brew cycle with these T-Discs? Before, the machine started very briefly and there was a several second pause before the cycle started.

"I can appreciate the gentle, subtle mildness of this Pekoe, but I suppose I prefer the ballsy kick of a nice Breakfast Tea. Even a harsh Irish type. The price jump up to this mid level premium brand just isn't justified by its marginally superior flavor. A teaspoon of sugar almost always balances the playing field with any decent commercial tea. Even Walmart generic tea suits my morning ritual just fine, at a tenth the cost! So there ya go. Cheerio...",0

"I LOVE ginger. It is so good for you. It's supposed to calm a sour stomach. There are lots of good health benefits. But this herbal root also gives you such a hot zing that you feel a little more awake along with bringing joy to your taste buds. That being said, my taste buds found the level of ginger in this beverage to be a little bit much. This would be great for the diehard ginger lover OR fantastic if mixed with fruit or other fruity herbs in hot water. This product could also add zing to your conventional iced tea in the summer. So I would recommend trying it. The fact that it is a powdered compounded product adds ease to mixing it for an instant cuppa lift!

"One of my favorite dishes to make at home is chicken piccata. It's a tasty chicken dish. One of the key components is capers, to add a bit of bite to the dish. Roland capers are normally the ones that I use (I know, they're not top of the line). Even though relatively inexpensive, they do the job on my chicken piccata (and other recipes calling for capers).

"I am a big fan of guatemalan coffee.  Starbucks Guatemalan is by far the best!  Costco's kirkland Guatemalan is pretty good.  I saw this Community Coffee guatemalan that had 15% off and another $3 coupon off, so i said what the heck i'll give it a shot.  Not nearly as good as Starbucks and not even close to Kirkland's.  Its subpar at best.  I don't hate it but I don't love it",0
"Being a big clif bar fan, I thought these would be great. However, they were very bland. Thankfully they were not sickeningly sweet like a fruit roll up and the ingredients were healthy.

They didn't like them at all and refused to even put them in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />These fruit snacks are healthy, but not tasty.",0

It still has the characteristic earthy flavor and umami mouthfeel, but just not as prominent. The leaf style is a little more broken than others I've tried. Still, all-in-all, I got my money's worth and would recommend it to someone who wants a classic Chinese green tea without floral or grassy notes.",0
It comes in a plastic jar. The toasty taste and smell are to over powering for me. Leaves me feeling a little queasy. Otherwise its a nice oil and I can buy it at the local Martians grocery store.

If you love an over powering taste and smell of coconut you will probably love this product if you don't then pass on this one.,0
"Let me first say that my daughter loves these from when she was 6 months old.  They are tasty and fun for her to eat; that's not the problem.<br /><br />After having been gummed for only a short time, these biscuits turn into a gluey, sticky mess.  It's amazing how tenaciously the goop sticks to mom, baby, clothes and anything else in the vicinity.  Be ready with several wet naps or a clothing change if you give these as a snack.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, they are HARD.  When my daughter is 3/4 finished with hers, she stuffs the whole thing in her mouth.  It will not dissolve, and instead becomes a rather large (in my opinion) choking hazard.  I will note that I have never had a choking incident with the product.  However, when I give her these biscuits I monitor her closely and take it away from her when about a quarter of it is left.",0
"I was hoping these graham crackers were the small Nabisco Honey Made boxes at the convenience stores.  They were wrapped in clear plastic wrap with no markings and shipped in a cardboard box.

"Those who transfer to a gluten-free diet know that getting enough fiber in their diets is a challenge.  Perky's Crunchy Flax Cereal is the highest fiber gluten free cold cereal I've found (6 grams or 24% of your daily allowance in a 3/4 cup serving). (Please let me know if you've found others with 6 grams or more of fiber a serving!) For its fiber content, it gets raves!  As a person who takes medication that leads to constipation and who can't eat many different fruits because I have interstitial cystitis, it's impossible to get enough fiber with fruits and vegetables alone. So, I eat this cereal every day and sometimes twice a day.<br /><br />I used to eat some great high fiber cereals before going gluten free.  While this cereal is a lifesaver because it is high fiber, the taste leaves something to be desired.  The ingredients in the cereal are sorghum flour, ground flax seed, raisin juice, honey, and salt.  That's it.  I'm thrilled there aren't a bunch of preservatives and artificial things in the cereal, but I wish they'd work on improving the taste of this cereal and perhaps making it available in various flavors.  As is, the cereal tastes a bit like a bland version of grape nuts. I've tried adding fruit and it helps a bit.  The best I've been able to make it taste is by adding a little stevia for more sweetness and come ceylon cinnamon (safer than regular cinnamon for those with IC) to it, but that blah taste still breaks through.<br /><br />The cereal stays super crunchy in milk for awhile before getting softer - good or bad, depending on what you like.  There's 200 calories in that 3/4 cup serving, which is a bit high, but you are getting a lot of omega 3 fatty oils from the flax seed, so that's a nice trade off.<br /><br />Aside from the taste, this is a great cereal.  But come on, don't we want our cereal to taste good?  That's the reason for the 3-star rating.",0
"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",0
"These pouches of ""Mediterranean Style"" Chuck Salmon are handy to have around the house for a quick snack with no prep time,or to take along for meals on the go. I like to keep things like this, or cans of kippered herring, along with rice cakes or WASA bread in my glove box because I do not eat fast food. The taste is good, with a bit of spiciness. I was a little disappointed that there were no Italian herbs like oregano or basil. Once I get my garden in, I'll just bring some along with me. But really, it would have helped the flavor and nutrician quite a bit if they had included some herbs. Also, the soybean oil taste is not great; olive oil would have been much better. My other suggestion would be less water. The net weight is 3.5 ounces, but because of the water content, there isn't as much actual salmon as I had anticipated. An OK product, though.",0
"These licorice wheels aren't bad. The texture is great, and the flavor is OK. But it's just OK.

"I'm not a tea connoisseur, so please take my review from the impression of a ""lay person"".<br /><br />When I first opened the package and brewed a cup, I thought it was sort of weak, but acceptable--light accents of fruit without the tea overpowering it. As time went on, I remembered that tea can lose flavor if it's exposed to air. While the paper bags containing the teabags are a wonderfully eco-friendly decision, they don't do much to protect the tea from air.<br /><br />Compounded with the fact there's only 1.3g of tea per bag (compared to 1.9 - 2.0g in some of lipton's other products), this tea will probably only be enjoyable if you use 2 bags if you don't drink it all fast (and maybe even if you do).<br /><br />That being said, the flavor is quite nice, with neither the fruit nor the tea overpowering one another. I just think they should have used more tea per bag.<br /><br />One last word, there is absolutely no acai in this--it's only flavoring. The anti-oxidants come from the green tea itself, so don't buy it if you're only after the properties of acai.",0

"I ordered a case of six boxes.  Each box was to include a pouch that contained the sauce and a small packet of spices.  Of the six boxes, only two contained the spices.  I was lucky in that I was making a large batch and used more than one box, so when I discovered the problem, I used one packet of spices for every three pouches of sauce  that I made.  But had I prepared only one box at a time, four of them would not have contained any spices at all.  For this reason, I would not purchase this product again.  It is very tasty, but since you cannot be sure you will get everything, I wouldn't advise taking the risk.",0
"This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU ""Petit Beurre"" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.",0

My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I'm not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.<br /><br />This product isn't so bad that I won't eventually finish the bottle, but it's not something I plan on purchasing in the future.",0

I was hoping for a mix comparable to Bellegem and this is not that mix. If you're looking for waffles with amazing flavor, you should pass this one up and try Bellegem instead.",0
"Yes, I know. It says ""vanilla"" and you expect it to taste like vanilla. What am I complaining about? Well, I was sort of expecting it to taste a bit more like coffee with a hint of vanilla, but instead this tastes like a blend of vanilla and coffee, in that order. Some people say they barely taste the vanilla. For me, it was front-and-center. It also had a sort of acid feel in the mouth, like fake vanilla, even though it says it uses real vanilla beans.<br /><br />It's good coffee, though. Quite strong, quite potent, and well-ground, it works in any coffee maker and it doesn't take much to make a nice, strong cup of coffee. It's just not for me. I'd recommend cutting this with another plain coffee, to minimize that strange vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you like vanilla, you'll probably like it. Me? I think I'd rather just order a mocha.",0

"Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog.  At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it.  The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating.  Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this.  He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog.  He did seem to be more ""chipper"" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat.  Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food.  I'm not sure I agree with the ""good for all life stages"" philosophy either.  In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels.  Much as humans do.  Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content.  Hope this helps!",0
"I haven't had licorice that tasted like this in years, and I still can't decide if that's a good thing. The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings).

They're addicting, but they just don't feel like food in your hands.",0

The seller recommends you reserve 1 lb for immediate use in the fridge and to store the remaining 2 lbs in the freezer for rapidly approaching anticipated use.

"I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me.",0
"I'm going to start by saying that I do enjoy this cereal and may purchase it again. The fiber content and the fact that the ingredients combine to make a complete protein make this a vegetarians delight. That being said, it isn't remarkably tasty without some doctoring. I put dry blueberries and a touch of honey on mine and it's delicious. But I can't responsibly give the cereal a perfect star rating if I have to alter it in order to enjoy.",0
"Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.",0
"I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.",0
"This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.",0
"This is an acceptable premium matcha tea.  But if you are looking for the best that Amazon has to offier, this does NOT compare to the DoMatcha 1st harvest organic matcha.  I tried DoMatcha and loved it, and I only strayed based on  the price...this IS a lot less and the reviews seems good enough.  Specifically: It IS about as green as DoMatcha (but  not quite) and decently smooth tasting, just not as ""bright"" as the DoMatcha 1st harvest.  I do not like the way it is packaged...as once you open it, it is loose in the tin (versus in a foil pouch), so you are going to lose some powder each time you make it just from opening the container. So even though it is cheaper, and you get a small fraction more, you are technically wasting some of the tea.  The tea, also doesn't blend easily with my traditional method of making a paste, then adding milk (I use almond milk) and hot water (not too hot!) and frothing it with the bamboo whisk along the way in stages.  Others have talked about having to sift their matcha, and this particular tea would seem to benefit from sifting, but who has time for that if it isn't necessary?  I have been making a small pitcher of this tea each morning and there is always sediment at the bottom of the pitcher and my cup and I did not experience this with DoMatcha.  So, if you do choose to buy this tea, you will not be unhappy, but you will be happier with DoMatcha 1st harvest organic.  I am going to try the 2nd harvest organic DoMatcha and see if that comes close enough to matching the 1st harvest. If so, that will be an even better buy, dollar for dollar..wait for more reviews.",0

"I love eating pistachios.  I like the pistachio taste and their crunch. I do not like having to open the shells though. I opted to try these as an alternative to the Keenan Farms in the shells that I normally order.  The pricing was very reasonable and none of the nuts were stale. While these where ok as far as pistachios go, they lacked the firm crunch and strong flavor I enjoy. Yes these were easy to eat, but missing out on the flavor and crunch make these a one-time order for me.",0

"The dark chocolate is perhaps the best thing about this granola bar, which otherwise seems rather generic - chewy but a little bland in flavor.  It's basically oats and chocolate - nothing fancy, and fine for a quick snack on the go, but it's not about to set the cereal bar world on fire.",0
"So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors.  I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a chocolate cookie.  The peanut butter ones are three stars too for the same reason.  The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!",0
"I got this because the Senseo pods were temporarily unavailable.  The coffee is okay, but not as good as the Senseo dark roast.  The pods are much bigger, which caused the hinge on my Senseo machine to have problems.  Of course, now you can't even get a Senseo machine, so oh well!",0

"I saw the review that gave a 1 star without actually receiving the product.  While I agree with that review that the contents should be listed, a simple web search revealed that this product is in fact (an all important point by the way) sweetened with Aspartame.<br /><br />If you are someone like me that likes tonic with their beverages but simply cannot stand diet tonic that is readily available due to the use of Saccharin as a sweetener (which makes me literally ill in tonic) then this *may* be a product for you.<br /><br />Is it as good as regular tonic (Canada Dry, Shwepps, store brands, or the premiums like Fever Tree)? - NO.<br /><br />Is it a livable substitute if you want to avoid the hundreds of calories? - YES.  It does however put a damper on your Gin or Vodka if you buy Premium brands.<br /><br />There are other Aspartame-sweetened diet tonic brands available that I have not tried due to the enormous shipping costs involved.",0
"I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.

The candies are softer and easier to chew than the usual gummy bears or happy colas which makes it easy to gulp down a whole bag in no time - even if the first few bites make your tounge stick ;-)<br />The German strawberry version ""Primavera"" is a very different kind of candy - be careful not to confuse these two (like I did ...).<br />To give you an idea where my Haribo taste buds come from: love Happy Cola, Fizzy Cola, Haribo Confect and several other Haribo candy that, unfortunately, are not available in the US.",0
"5 Stars for the product minus two for the price mess up from the shipper...ultimately corrected...but I will now purchase the cans at the store....my dogs gobbled this down, mixed with their kibble---so I am very happy with the product",0
"Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds (Dark Chocolate flavor) offer an interesting take on the age-old combination of chocolate and nuts. Instead of being coated in a ""skin"" of chocolate, the nuts are roasted in what appears to be cocoa powder; the result is a mixed bag.<br /><br />Although there's a definite hint of chocolate flavor, it's not very strong, and if you're looking for a chocolate-y treat, you'll probably be disappointed. However, if what you want are almonds with a twist, then you'll likely be delighted with Emerald's latest  product.",0
I purchased this as a gift and the recipient said the coffee was good but not as good as other Kona they had tasted.,0
"As a confirmed Hamburger Helper junkie, I was very curious to see if Velveeta had the goods to dethrone ""The Helping Hand"" as my comfort food of choice. First off, I'll say this: The ULTIMATE CHEESEBURGER SKILLETS DINNER does, indeed, taste remarkably like a real cheeseburger. Going beyond just offering cheese-covered noodles and ground beef, there are hints of ketchup and mustard and onions, among other tantalizing tastes. My Wife, who is not a big fan of Hamburger Helper, stopped after a few bites- The mustard taste was too much for her. My eight year-old Daughter, not a huge fan of meat of any kind, loved it. For my part, I ate my first helping with gusto, but by the time seconds rolled around, the spice mixture was getting to be overpowering and a bit sickening. I scrapped the noodles and ate the rest of the ground beef. It wasn't bad, but the spice mix wasn't something that made me want to keep eating it. I'll happily try other Velveeta Hamburger Helper knock-offs, but this one didn't quite hit the spot the way I'd hoped.",0
we tried some other organic baby foods lately and she loved them but unfortunately she hates HATES HATES this food.  She's never had such a reaction to any food before but actually cried and screamed at the first taste of this.  I guess it's just not for her.  We've given her other foods from happy baby and she's loved them but this one she will not eat.  Too bad I bought a huge package!,0
"I didn't really like this soup as I found it rather boring to eat. I mean, the lime flavoring was a good idea but it should have been a little more powerful you can only vaguely taste it in the soup if you concentrate. Overall, I dont think it had enough pizazz. I mean, if you like to eat plain beans you will like this but if not...-_-",0
"This cookie is very similar to the Chewy Chips Ahoy except it has added chocolate chips on the outside.  It tastes okay but it's not going to earn raves.  Just like the Megafudge version, the cookies are very small and at 150 calories per serving (which is only a few cookies), it's not worth it. The taste isn't spectacular, cookie kind of dry, although the fudge center tasted good. It's a small package as well (10 oz) and at more than $3, I think I can find a better tasting and more satisfying cookie at my local grocer.",0
"These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an ""off"" batch.",0
"Edible, but not great. I picked these up because Amazon had stopped carrying Pemmican beef jerky (which hadn't been the same since the company was sold anyway) and I was looking for something to snack on. I like Slim-Jims ok when they're good (but quality control is a major issue with Slim-Jims, as for every good one you get, you're likely to get one that tastes rancid or worse).<br /><br />Obviously, these aren't like beef jerky, they're closer to Slim-Jims. The consistency seems to be much better than Slim-Jims and the price is pretty good. The flavor isn't as good as a good Slim-Jim, but is much better than a bad one, so it kind of evens out.<br /><br />I was hoping these would be closer to the ""Matador"" line of snack sticks that Jack Link's makes. For whatever reason, despite carrying many Jack Link's products at present, Amazon doesn't seem to have the Matador line.",0
I usually love Kashi products but this one caught me off guard.  They have a nice flavor but they are kind of dry and pasty.  Very hard to eat without having a drink nearby.,0
"It is a naturally sweetened soda with Stevia, but I expect more robust flavor simular to Dr. Pepper.  I wouldn't even say it is close to Dr. Pepper.  I was disappointed, especially when I love the ""Cola"" flavor of Zevia so much.",0
"My order doesn't appear to be melted, but it was left on the porch around noon without ringing the doorbell on a day that's expected to get over 80 degrees, so order at your own risk.<br /><br />Whoppers - 53<br />Hershey Bars - 21<br />Reese's Cups - 17<br />Kit Kats - 12<br />TOTAL - 103 Pieces",0
"I LOVE the taste of this coffee...bought the Cyclone.  I have made either 4 or 5 and 2 have exploded and made a mess in my Keurig and all over my counter.  I now see that that was a problem in the past, which I hadn't noticed--however the company says it is fixed.  I am definitely having some issues, which is too bad because I really like the coffee.  Would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to clean up such a mess.  Now I have a bunch of cups that I don't know if I should make or not?",0
"My wife loves this tea. I tried a cup and I like it too, even though I'm a coffee drinker.<br /><br />The problem is, 5 out of every 6 K-Cups we've used have split open and spread the ground-up tea all over the place. It takes the fun out of having this type of coffee/tea maker if you have to clean it after every cup.<br /><br />We've bought these before, from a different source, and didn't have this problem. We're hoping this was just a bad batch. At any rate, if you buy these, be aware that you may have many cleanups in your future.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the tea itself is so good.",0
"I love chocolate. If a manufacturer wants to guarantee that I'll toss a box of their product into the basket at the grocery store, just add some chocolate. Well, unless it's bacon, bacon doesn't need chocolate.<br /><br />When I saw this Nature's Path, I thought it would be a great replacement for my typical evening treat of Cocoa Krispies. And health-wise, it is a step in the right direction. A definite plus, because I can now say ""healthy"" and ""chocolate cereal"" in the same sentence.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have finally found something that I consider too rich and chocolaty. The actual cocoa-saturated oat clusters are very good, not too sweet, just the right amount of crunch (if you eat fast enough). If they'd added more than a thimbleful of the dried strawberries, I think the taste would be darned near irresistible. Unfortunately, there's not enough of the tangy berry to offset the very rich and sweet chocolate. The addition of actual chunks of dark chocolate just really take it over the top.<br /><br />This does make me want to try some of Nature's Path other cereal offerings, the quality of the product is very good, and the ingredients are healthy.",0
I love marmalade and constantly am searching to find an exceptional product.  This was not it.  The bitterness was there but the product was just too dense as if it had too much pectin.  I blended it with a domestic marmalade and together they were satisfactory.  The search continues.,0
"this took way too long to get here but we love the pretzels! they are light and airy and delicious, and are always sold out at whole foods.",0
"I enjoy this product simply because it is beef jerky (don't know when I became a redneck) and I like how it comes in 1-oz packages, but I won't be ordering this flavor again.  I'd recommend the pepper flavor instead.",0
"I bought a quart ($50 + shipping) direct from the vendor, expecting to be amazed based on AMZN reviews and reviews on the vendor's site.  I wasn't amazed.  Yes, it is delicious, something like a lobster bisque with a few chunks of claw meat added.  Very rich and flavorful, but not noticeably better than any premium lobster bisque in your grocery.  Did I enjoy it?  Absolutely!  Would I buy it again?  At $50 a quart plus shipping, no way.  A can of good quality lobster bisque plus a few big shrimp will satisfy your craving for the flavor and leave a lot more money in your pocket.",0
"Because its called Flax Plus Maple, I shouldn't have been surprised that it was maple flavored, but they went a bit too heavy handed with the maple.  Its overwhelming.  However, if cut with 75% of another cereal, such as muesli or granola, you get just the right amount of maple.  However, if you love to flood your pancakes with more syrup than pancakes, this would be perfect right out of the box.",0
"This is an old school DVD. The only extras are ""Read only"" no making of or anything. Still, it is a nice picture that we love about DVDs.",0
"As one who really likes Gevalia cofee, I had visions of creamy chocolate truffles melting in my mouth when I read the box.  The reality was a rather rude awakening.<br /><br />If you have ever had chocolate extract, it does not taste quite like chocolate.  It is said to contain the ""top notes"" that are lost in heating and processing of cocoa.  The top notes do not taste like the chocolate we know and love because we aren't use them.  Some people like it, some find it artificial tasting.  This Gevalia chocolate truffle coffee tastes like cheap Folgers with a splash of chocolate extract.  I think the chocolate flavoring ruined the wonderful taste of the Gevalia coffee.  I tried different things:  adding cream, sugar and even vanilla extract.  Although I could get it to taste quite good, the coffee by itself was a disappointment and was not very good without a lot of doctoring.",0
Not very sweet in comparison to Southern Sweet Tea I've had and not very tea tasting either.  Quite disappointed and won't be ordering this again.,0
The Juice doesn't taste good to me. I think my expectations were way too high. I recently purchased a premium acai juice that cost 100$ for four bottles that tasted amazing. I'm not sure if antioxidants are the same as getting actual vitamins? It is only 93% juice and It tastes more like cane sugar. I got a cold shortly after drinking this product. Not sure if it was related to drinking the juice.,0
"These Lipton To Go Stix are small packets of powder which you mix with water to make a green tea beverage.  I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.<br /><br />Summary:  If you like your iced tea to be very sweet, and you want a diet version, you will probably like this.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Low calorie: only 5 calories.<br />- Taste: Hint of honey up front and a mild green tea flavor coupled with fruit.<br />- Portable:  One small packet makes 16oz<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Very sweet.  This is personal preference.  If you like your iced tea very sweet, you'll probably like this.  I personally like about half the sweetener.  I'm not sure why diet drink makers feel the need to make their artificially-sweetened drinks so sweet.  The main flavor I taste here is the splenda sweetener.<br />- Dissolves slow.  After 60 seconds of stirring there were still a couple of clumps.",0
"I'm not sure what a Jalapeno sauce is supposed to taste like, but this one isn't as spicy as something with 'Jalapeno' in the title would imply. It does have a nice light Jalapeno and creamy flavor, which isn't too bad, just not my favorite taste. It seems more suited as an accompanying flavor than a primary sauce. I found it was fairly tasty spread on sandwiches along with another sauce, such as BBQ sauce.",0
"I have to say that I was disappointed in this coffee.  The Kona coffee I remember was not at all bitter and had a unique taste.  This coffee was bitter and that unique Kona taste wasn't there.  As coffee goes, it wasn't bad, but not any better than I could get at Starbucks.",0
"I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1/2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!<br /><br />The ""Salt & Pepper"" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!<br /><br />The ""BBQ"" is good, but not that good!<br /><br />The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what-so-ever nor my other 4 friends!<br /><br />The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!<br /><br />3 starts is too much for this over-marketed, less of flavor, and over-priced snack!<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />2 stars off: bad flavors<br /><br />1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it!",0
"Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note. I was not as taken by the strength of the blend.  Mild to bland would be my comment there. All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay",0
"I need to increase my nutritional intake due to a health condition.  It was suggested I put this on my popcorn to help boost my health. I toss it with some olive oil on my popcorn and treat myself to some Hawaiian sea salt too.  It isn't ""much"" but it makes me feel proactive in managing my health.  It is certainly an acquired taste.  It is helping me with my vitamin levels so I am pleased. It is a lot cheaper on so many levels than a visit to the clinic.",0
"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",0
My Chauncy is spoiled. He gets raw marrow bones so he did not have an interest in this. May be good for a dog that hasn't had the taste of a real bone.,0
This used to be my favorite bold coffee.  However my last two orders of this product have been disappointing.  It has now become bitter and less flavorful.  Also the lid has changed color (now dark blue like all other Timothy coffees).  It is time to try other brands! 04/2009,0
I bought this k-cup after all the positive reviews and was disappointed. The caramel after taste is bad. Gave the rest of the box to a friend who happened to love it.,0
"I bought these a few days ago to try out for $5 for (1) 11 oz bag at Costco. They are edible but not great. The slices are too thick IMO making some really hard, I have found ends and many slices with the core still in it. These are pretty bitter as well. I think I would enjoy the red ones a lot more but am not sure if Costco carries those. Still well worth $5 though considering a reg. bag of organic chips aren't much less... the price on here is pretty nuts though! :(",0
it would have been good only the expiration date was over due by about 10 months<br />but the dog loved them anyway they should really keep an eye on those dates for sure<br />Marielle,0
"I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages, and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad, but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent, and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well, I was expecting I'd like this one as well, but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better, but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking.",0
"This is nice soup, however 7 out of 8 cans were dented, many were seriously dented.<br /><br />I would only buy this on extreme sale because of the dented cans. I give the soup 4 stars and the cans 0 stars.",0
"""Mentos Watermelon Gum"" is a fairly good tasting sugarfree gum, but the flavor dissipates very quickly. This gum has a hard outer shell and a soft inside, but it isn't the ""squirt"" type that you might expect by looking at the picture on the plastic package (it is way over packaged, in my opinion). Each package contains 15 pieces.<br /><br />Not recommended",0
"Definitely came with 72 packets, but I kind of expected the box to be bigger. 72 packets fits into a pretty small box! $16 is a lot for gummy bears, but I guess I got what I ordered so I'm satisfied enough. If you want 'em bad enough, it's certainly as advertised! just be aware of what you're getting for your money.",0
"Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.",0
"I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.",0
"I have been using this shampoo for a week now. I have been using it alone, without the additional conditioner. My hair is long, straight and very fine. I use volumizing shampoos as a matter of routine. I usually move between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISB3AG"">Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139353Q"">Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo, Lemon Sage</a>. Both of these work great for me, although they have different issues. Pantene is instant volume, but coats your hair. Lemon Sage, if used with the conditioner, works well but costs a good bit more. It also creates build-up, but not nearly as quickly.<br /><br />I found this shampoo pretty much on par with those (left my hair soft, full and pleasantly but not strongly scented), with one exception - my hair looks pretty good immediately after I wash it, but not so good the day after, and since I typically wash my hair in the evening this means I don't get the benefit when I want it most. Both Pantene and Lemon Sage seem to last from shampoo to shampoo.<br /><br />Like Pantene, this product does build-up. The effect of this is to actually weigh down your hair and make it look flat and greasy. This can be counteracted by periodically using a good clarifying shampoo - weekly or every other week. I'm in-between at the moment, as the one I've used for some time has gone off the market. I wound up picking up <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027C9CS"">Suave For Men, Deep Clean Peppermint</a> even though I'm not a man, because it was the only one the store I was in seemed to carry, and I was out. But I'm in the market for something better. This one strips away the build-up, but it's very harsh; it actually burns my scalp.<br /><br />I experienced the same problem many others have reported: while it was only a small amount, my bottle leaked in shipment. I doubt I lost much product, but who would want to lose any? If I ever decide to pick this up again (and I may not, given the next day issue), I'll probably look for it in a store.<br /><br />I'll note that the product may perform better with the matching conditioner, but it might also lead to quicker product build-up.",0
"I have used the clear scalp & hair beauty strong lengths shampoo alone and with this conditioner and I don't see any benefit to using the conditioner.  By comparison the shampoo is very thick and luxurious and the conditioner is very thin and light.  It is most likely because with the nourishing and moisture rich feeling you already get from the shampoo you can get by with a light duty conditioner.  In my case it just isn't needed at all and that is taking into consideration before using this product line, I have experienced breakage while trying to grow my hear longer.  I might use the conditioner once or twice a week for the heck of it but in the future I will probably not bother buying it again.",0
I LOVE the flavor of this coffee but my normal portion size on my Keurig Brewer must be changed to the next smaller size down or it's like drinking water.<br /><br />The flavor with the smaller portion is really delicious so it's worth having a smaller cup.  I would buy again but for a full size of similar flavor I will stick with Green Mountain Coffee Limited Edition Golden French Toast.,0
"I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.",0
"The product came swiftly. I expected it to be jerky like the chicken strips that I have gotten before for my dog, that look like dehydrated breasts, but it is different. My dog did not like them, but she is picky. It would be probably be fine for other dogs, and I like the fact it has the extra joint support in it. I would buy from this company again, just not this product due to my dogs taste, not the product.",0
Pop chips are great but you really have to be a garlic lover to enjoy this one as a snack.,0
"I had tried the speghetti and it was AWESOME!!! I tried the pasta boxes and they taste normal, you can not tell them apart from the normal noodles you get in the store. I tried the mac/cheese box, the noodles were ok but I am not a fan of the cheese seasoning they give you. I understand they are trying to keep down the calories. I would prefer to buy the noodles and make my own cheese sauce for my mac/cheese in the future. Overall, the pasta is really great.",0
"I love the sauce, but I did find the postage quite high and the product was slow arriving",0
"The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, ""original wild"" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous.  My mouth was burning for an hour afterwards.  This may be ""fun"" for some but not for me!  And I will give the ""mild"" a try - just to be fair).",0
"At first my dog loved this food, but after couple days he got really tired of it. once you open the can it smell like fish and I don't know if it is normal... I stop giving him the can because it would't it is... I guess it is better for you to try it out for at least 1 or 2 week before buying a LOT like I did...",0
"If your like me and hate water, even bottled water, then this is a great portable water enhancer. Like the other flavors it does have a certain taste other than the flavor that is consistant in their product. Can't really describe it but it doesn't really bother me either. I do like adding it to my water bottle when I take the dogs out to the nature preserves for a very long hike since I can't stand water. I do recommend the other flavors to this one though. I love sweet tea infused with real peaches and this is not at all close to the real thing in my opinion, more like close to a kool-aid flavor. Still RECOMMENDED.",0
"I just got my first order of Copper Moon here in Afghanistan, and was really excited to finally, hopefully, have a really good cup of coffee.  Alas, it was not to be.  Not that the coffee is bad, mind you.  If I had to sum this coffee up in one word, it would be ""average.""<br />  Yes, as others have noted, it is not in any way bitter, but it just doesn't stand out head and shoulders above the pack.  When the PX here has any at all, they carry a German brand that is equally non-bitter, but has a more robust flavor, without being bitter and overpowering like most coffee from St**b**ks.<br />  Ah well, live and learn!",0
"This was good but not worth the extra money.  Honestly, it tasted mainly like a ""lemon-lime"" type concoction as opposed to a margarita.  However, it wasn't bad but the same taste could probably be achieved by ordering a simple lemon-lime flavor.",0
"I'll be honest, I'm one of the few who isn't a big fan of Starbucks coffee. I think the coffee is a bit too bitter. So, I was reluctant to try this coffee.<br /><br />Having said that, I was very pleasantly surprised by the fact that this particular coffee is not at all bitter. But, that's where my excitement stopped. The coffee really didn't have much flavor. It didn't have that rich coffee taste. I also didn't taste any vanilla at all. I must admit, I'm used to freshly ground coffee, so the fact that this coffee is pre-ground may make a difference. I can't vouch for the whole bean option. However, with my experience, for the price, I'd look elsewhere.",0
"my kids are in 1st grade now, and they do not want to drink from the kindergarten juice box size. It is a rite of passage into their development. Please offer this product and especially the carrot and apple in larger portion servings; even for the adults-please.",0
"A simple meal is often welcome when your working life takes up a good portion of your day and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger offers exactly that. It contains the basic ingredients in a box, ready to prep and serve with minimal effort or culinary skill. All you need is ground beef and water to create this food product and it can be served as a main dish or a side dish with other foods.<br /><br />Velveeta is the most popular processed cheese food in America and while I am not too fond of the taste of the actual cheese product, I have found the Velveeta meals a decent tasting food that makes for a reasonably easy meal. And this particular product is no exception. The cheese is fairly smooth and there is a decent amount of balance from the seasoning mix. I found it compatible to my palate, even though I readily admit it is nothing incredible.<br /><br />Nutritionally, Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger is fairly good. The base product, without meat, has a good amount of calcium and iron. But on the negative side, there is a good deal of sodium in this product and it definitely comes through in the taste, which is a little saltier than I prefer. Calories are not too bad, provided you can consume in moderation. A single box is intended to serve five people and if you can keep your portion down at that level, your waistline and heart shouldn't suffer.<br /><br />I like meals that are easy to prepare and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger certainly fits in this category. There is little to do other than brown the ground beef, add water, stir, and wait. Taste- wise, the product is good, but not great and it doesn't come even close to the taste of a freshly made meat, pasta, and cheese casserole. However, it will do in a pinch and it has enough to offer to award it with a slight recommendation.",0
"before you buy this, make sure you do your research first.  it may be potent- good and bad for you.",0
"I recieved the product VERY quickly and felt I got a good deal, which was great, but the pill pockets inside the bags are very dry and difficult to work with. A little disappointing, since I know that the texture should be akin to Play-Dough, which makes it conducive to hiding pills in. Also, the packaging is actually different than what is pictured, which I expected.",0
"My two dogs get a chicken breast filet at bedtime each night.  They love them.  I have tried many different brands; they love them all.  This particular brand has one thing I really like; they are fairly uniform in size.  However, the ingredients list vegetable glycerin which I don't see the point of in a jerky type treat but also provides some carbohydrates.  This may be good or bad, depending on if you are looking for a pure protein source. The reason they get 3 stars, and the reason I probably won't buy again, is they contain salt.  Why? Other brands are only chicken breast filets with no additives.  And yes, they are made in China, but most are.  Just have to use good sense; they are a treat and should only be a small percentage of the dog's daily intake.",0
"with so many choices, we were on a caffeine high after choosing one of this.. one of that.. now try this one.. but, i wish there would have been even more variety. some of the flavors only had one k-cup while the hazelnut and french vanilla had 7 or 8 each.",0
"I have used many, if not all of Amazon's available ponzu, and this product is ok, but I much prefer Marukin Nama Ponzu 11.3 fl oz for $4.79.

It is a little bland, but saltier than I really like. Amazon has many ponzu choices, and possibly one is  almost as good as the Marukin, but probably not.",0
"The product was shipped by U.P.S.  It was clearly marked ""Chocolate - Store in a cool dry place.""  It was, nonetheless, left at my doorstep when I was not home.  I do not know how long it had been sitting in the Florida heat before I got home, but the product was melted and all but inedible.<br /><br />It strikes me that I shuld have received a notice of attempt to deliver, and the product should be kept in a ""cool dry place"" until it could be accepted by me.",0
"The bread comes out alright (and has a sour smell/taste), but given that the packaging contains a packet of yeast and has flavors added to the flour, I am inclined to believe that this is not really sourdough.",0
I *love* the Multigrain flavor of these chips/crackers!  I especially love the fact that they're only 80 mg of sodium--so I was totally excited to see--under the nutritional info at Amazon--that the olive and jalapeno flavors were also 80 mg of sodium per serving.  So I ordered all three.  Imagine my total shock and dismay to find out that the olive and jalapeno flavors are truly 210 mg of sodium per serving! Just wanted to warn all future buyers--if you must watch your salt for health reasons--stick to the Multigrain ones!,0
When I ordered this item it's exactly what I would expect it to be a natural herbal laxative. It does list the importance of shouldn't be taken if pregnant as it's also a very powerful laxative and may not be suitable for some other individuals with possible digestive issues too. I know this practicing herbal medicine for over 20yrs it's warnings are valid but it should be more classified as a colon aid then a diet aid. Better yet labeled truly as it is a laxative,0
"They were certainly packed well, with dry ice and all.  I don't think they would have thawed out in a month.  I've only tried the chocolate peanut butter and it was OK.  For the price I was expecting much more.  I like it best when almost completely thawed.  Then is tastes like a frosty from Wendy's.",0

"Taste is just Ok, a bit greasy compare to 94% fat free micro kettle pop corn bags (purchases here at better cost.) Coconut flavor is like coconut flakes flavoring.<br />Not a good value since you get 18 bags for $30.

The bomb. Well these bombed.<br />Put these out next to the M&M's.  The M&M's were gone and this dish was still full.<br />Extra Extra Extra hard shell with a mild coffee taste.<br />Since its several pounds it should last for a lifetime.,0
"I tried this just to see if it lived up to the Starbucks name. The flavor just wasn't there. It has some vanilla flavor but not what i would expect from this brand of coffee. I think I will stick to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a> added to regular coffee. Then I can adjust the taste to my mood.",0

"After hearing that beef bones are bad for dogs (splinters and such), I started searching for a safer alternative for my german shepard Wiz.<br />Previous good reviews convinced me this braided rawhide ring was suitable.<br /><br />Wiz was ecstatic (as he always is whenever he gets something from Amazon). He pranced around happily, showing off his new toy.<br />After an hour, he ripped out a chunk of the ring. After a week, the ring pretty much disintegrated.<br /><br />Price and durability knocked this product down for me, but Wiz was satisfied.<br />Not recommended for real HEAVY-DUTY chewer.",0

"i LOVE these raspberries. absolutely delicious and addictive. thing is...whole dried and organic don't make up for the fact that they add sugar -- and calories -- to something that really doesn't need it. at the very least, can't you please cut the sugar in half? then you'd have a customer for life.",0
"Some people can make the Best coffee with the 'Chock Full O'Nuts' brand.  I'm not one of them, but my mom sure is.  Not sure how she does it except that she measures one cup of water for one scoop of coffee (or something like that-- geez is it any surprise that hers is better than mine?)<br /><br />Mom's coffee comes out with a deep, dark flavor that is absolutely yummy after dinner.  It manages to revive the adults even after a huge Thanksgiving meal.<br /><br />Three Stars.  My advice would be to try this affordable coffee if you have the magic coffee touch.  But if you are a mere mortal like myself, stick to more idiot proof brands.  Or only buy one experimental can.<br /><br />And yes, alas... no nuts in Chock Full O'.",0
"Very hard coating and the flavor is mediocre. Not as good as expected. I've found jordan almonds at Target (not my favorite store by any means-but credit where credit is due) that had a much nicer taste and were not so break your teeth hard... they were also less than half the price of these. Will not buy these again sadly, because I liked that they were supposedly made by a family owned company.",0
"Before purchasing this sugar, I read the many positive reviews.  I definitely think this is a healthier alternative to the processed white sugar you buy in grocery stores.  However, I did find that this has a very distinct flavor and could not use it in all my baking.  For example, if you use this sugar to sweeten a drink such as tea, the flavor is overpowering.  I attempted to make a fresh strawberry pie and needed to sweeten the strawberries and thicken into a syrup.  I used only this brand sugar and ended up dumping all the ingredients and starting over because the taste was just terrible.  Now I typically combine Rapunzel sugar with another organic brand when baking anything, just to avoid the possibility of tasting this sugar throughout my food.  The value is great, I just can't use it as my go-to sugar.",0
I expected a little more flavor as I usually like Green Mountain Coffees.<br />Next time I'll look for a French Roast!,0
"Item's picture shows box with 40 tea bags, totaling 2.56 OZ (72g).  What I have actually got is box with 40 tea bags, totaling 1.73 OZ (49g)!

"I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless.

"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.",0
"One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.",0
"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.",0
"Comes in round, flat, pods so beware before purchasing. I just dropped one in the filter holder of my regular coffee maker used about 1 cup of water and it worked out OK. There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no ""berry notes"".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try. This coffee is fine for the average coffee drinker. It's not bold enough for the purist, but won't offend them either.",0
"i love this coffee, it's my favorite however it doesn't come in decaf and i can only drink so much caffine without the side effects. please come out with decaf, we love coffee too.",0
"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",0
"Love the packaging!! As for this flavor - my 2 yr old loved it but I thought it was not great, very thick.",0
"This is the first time I ordered, I hadn't read the reviews, which I know I should have. The product was very very sweet, and I like sweet. I kept the coffee, BUT, personally this might be ok if I make it as an iced coffee for the summer.  I guess if you like extra sweet, this is the coffee for you.",0
"I think it's good quality tea for what you are paying, however one should be aware that this is not top of the line silver needle tea.  There are better examples out there.",0
"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!",0

This product is great as you will see an increase in your milk supply probably btw 1-3 days after taking these pills BUT what I did notice 3/4wks into taking it that all of a sudden I was eating like I was pregnant (increased appetite) and needless to say looking very swollen and gaining extra weight.  It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises.,0
"First I should say that I'm a popcorn-aholic.  I love popcorn - mostly just the plain white stuff.  I'm not much of a fan of carmel corn and for the most part I only like cheese corn when it's mixed with plain popcorn.  This popcorn was okay.  The carmel corn was light and crispy but to me it tasted like there was way too much vanilla in the carmel coating.  The cheese corn was much softer than the carmel and I thought that was the better of the two flavors because it wasn't overpowering (remember, I don't like super cheesy popcorn).  Oh, and for some reason, it seems that the tufts of cheese popcorn were much smaller than the carmel corn; I like big fluffy pieces of popcorn, not little ones.<br /><br />This certainly doesn't compare to any candy store popcorn (I occasionally treat myself to popcorn from [...] - it's the BEST popcorn ever!)and I didn't expect it to.  I did hope it might be close to Earl's Popcorn, which is also prepackaged but sadly, it comes in well behind them.  All in all, it was fresh and tasty, just not quite what I was looking for.",0
"Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats.",0
"I don't really dig the flavor or texture of these snacks. It has a funny bite to it, which I'm sure is from the OJ and lacks any crunch. However, the packaging was great, came quickly, and was good quality.",0
"I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the ""chili"" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again.",0
These are very good. I have ordered this product many times. this is the only time the order was stale. I have ordered since and everything has been fine. I would still recommend this product to everyone.,0
"Be careful!  The low carbs get you, but if you have a problem with sodium, realize the content is high!  I have been buying these ""crunchy cheese snacks"" in Classic White Cheddar for a couple of years.  I was originally drawn by the low carbs per serving bag.  The 1/2 oz bag says ""1 g"".  I bought them by the box of 16 packs.  I used ""subscribe and save"" and started buying 4 boxes of 16 - 1/2 oz bags, per month. That's 64 of these 1/2 oz bags each month.  They are also available in 2 oz bags. Plus, they grow on you.  Literally.  I knew, but didn't take into consideration the high sodium - 275mg per 1/2oz bag - until recently.  A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content.  I hope it happens, soon.  I won't buy any more until they do. I like that they are also Gluten-Free.  It's just too much sodium for a little bag and people should be aware of it.",0
"This drink mix works as well as products similar to it.  The powder is difficult to get disolved completly, but can be done.  I did not like the flavor, way more banana than strawberry.  It did help me stay satisfied until my next meal.",0
"Newman's Own has branched out quite a bit into different types of organic foods since it's beginning, most with a good degree of success. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about this licorice. I am addicted to licorice (yes, even black licorice) and the thought of a pomegranate flavor was pretty cool, since I really like that fruit. So I can say the concept was better than the actualization.<br /><br />This licorice is a bit tough, and doesn't seem to have a very strong flavor. There is a bit of tart pomegranate, but I'm not sure that most people would be able to identify the fruit in a blind taste test. However, the flavor was good enough to keep me eating. What wasn't very good was the after-taste. I'm not sure what in the licorice would cause it, but it hits fairly quickly and does not fade very fast. It's sort of bitter, and is not very pleasant. The semi-good news (I suppose) is that it does not increase with the consumption of more licorice - it just stays constant, there in the background.<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors of their licorice (if they have any) to know if there is an after-taste with those as well, or if it's something to do with the pomegranate flavor. But I can say with some certainty that I will not be buying this licorice of my own accord.",0
"Taste good, but a bit different than traditional western soda. Not too sweet, maybe a little more carbonated than it should be, so kids will think it has a mildly spicy taste. The prices for this package are a bit high, probably because of how much packaging is involved for shipping, but other than that, good product. I have bought each of these individual Ramune at an Asian Super Market. Each bottle costs $1.99, and my local Asian supermarket offers one free when you buy two. If you live in/near a fairly large city, just use Google maps to find an Asian supermarket near you that has Japanese goods and buy from there.",0
"Well, I keep testing different food products for gluten-free items which appeal. This product was sort of mediocre. It didn't taste bad, but I didn't like the flavor, or lack of it, in the 'pasta' portion of the ravioli. I will eat what I purchased but won't buy it again.",0
"This stuff is amazing! Doggie love's the green one (apples) the orange ones also. This is red so the dye in it can make your dog's stool darker in color / almost black. We freaked out the first time thinking he had blood in his stool but it's the dye. It is quite large so only give this to your dog if he is a larger breeder or larger puppy that's finished teething. FYI : this took 4-5 days to ship to me and I did pay shipping even though I had in my cart more than $25 worth of product. This is the smaller box. They offer this in a larger box. Very good, and great ingredients. Just read the label for the size and weight of product.",0
"I purchased this salt after hearing about my sister's trip to Haiwaii. The salt is fine, and I like it, but it cost me almost twice that amount to ship it to me in NY so I was not a fan. I will be suing it sparingly and be on the search for it in specialty stores. The price was right BEFORE I actually saw the shipping price.",0
"We were expecting these to be a bit different than what we got.  They are drier and not sweet. (I actually tend to like things not sweet). I am sure they are probably good for you & they are not the worst bars we have tried. I think for the cost, I wish I enjoyed them more. You get enough bars to last a long time. They'll probably expire before we use them all, though.",0
"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can.",0
"This coconut water is ok, I have a whole case, so I will drink it, but I may put it in smoothies or mix it with something.  I can't find the first coconut water I tried and really liked, so thought I would try this.  It is lacking the sweet, fresh, refreshing taste that made me go searching for coconut water.  The taste and aftertaste have a vague similarity to the tang of sour milk to me.  I was hoping that maybe it was my first one, but I've had 3 or 4 now and I'm still not thrilled with the taste.",0
good but does not have nutritional information on the box or on pouches and I've ordered this twice and never got a full 100 count box.,0
"I used this gravy in a shepherds pie recipe, and it wasn't very good. Haven't tried it by itself though.",0
"This is what I use to add to the Maxwell House flavor to get an OK cup of coffee from my Tassimo machine.  With Starbucks dropping the T-Disc format, I had to start experimenting with blending what is still available in T-Discs to get something I like.  If this doesn't work out, I will soon have a used Tassimo on the market and will look to move to K-cups and Keurig.",0
"I bought this thinking it was going to be a lot of gummy bears, just to have at work. But turns out that 5 pounds isn't as much as I thought it would be, a co-worker and I finished these in about a week. I thought $15 was a great price for the amount but it really is not. I have gone to other stores such as Target and bought some of the generic gummy bears which taste almost exactly the same for about half the price. But then if you really do like the Haribo gummy bears it is a good purchase, but if you are not picky I would suggest you buy some generic ones.",0

"I used to buy World's Best Cat litter when my cats were kittens then I switched to Fresh Step after they turned 1 year old. The world's best litter is pricy and does not absorb odor well. My first Fresh Step litter is the original Natural Scoop which is much more affordable and is able to minimize the odor not to mention it's 99% natural. My cats had no trouble adapting to it. But for some reason, Fresh Step stop carrying the Natural line so i had to get the ""Perfume and Dye free"" which is slightly cheaper and does a even better job with odor control but it seems to be phasing out as well (I checked fresh step web site and they no longer display that line). I'm quite disappointed that they stop producing both these litter. The new Natural pack does not have good reviews... I'm hoping that they bring back the original Nature and continue to produce the Perfume & Dye Free litter.",0
"After reading a number of reviews of this product, I'm baffled.  Some people love them, and some compare them to a Pop Tart.  The item I got is nothing like a Pop Tart in texture.  It's not what I'd call a cookie either, and it's not my definition of crispy.  I'd call it a dry, hard cracker.  The blueberry filling tastes pretty good.  It's a good combo of tart, sweet and fruity.  But there isn't a lot of it, and I just can't get past the unpleasant, cardboard exterior.  I thought maybe I got a package with an expired freshness date, but it's Sept 4, 2012, so not that.  These bars don't seem to pack much nutrition, according to the labeling.  I think you can do better for a 100 calorie snack.",0
"I love sweet tea but don't want the extra calories so I opt for unsweetened with Splenda. I was looking for a K-cup tea for iced tea and thought I'd give this one a shot since it claims Perfect Iced Tea. I am sorry I did. It is bitter and has a strong floral taste. I've tried different settings on my brewer and even extra ice and water in it and I still can't make it taste right. I like my iced tea stronger than my family but this one is even too strong for me. It's also ""cloudy"" and looks like ""swamp water"".  I think I'll go back to making iced tea with Celestial English Breakfast Blend. It won't make as big a glass but it's not as over powering.",0
"I purchased NEURO TRIM on a whim. Lately I've been interested in trying different energy drinks, supplement drinks, beverages that claim to aid in weight loss, etc. I was intrigued by the bottle's shape, the purple color of the container, and the unique cap. Per the instructions on the bottle, I didn't consume the beverage until about an hour before dinner. I had been rather hungry that day, so I was surprised that by the time dinner actually arrived, I didn't feel as hungry as I had earlier. Other than a slight sweet taste, the drink was rather tasteless. The closest thing the flavor reminds me of is a weak mixture of Kool-Aid.<br /><br />The packaging says that NEURO TRIM helps with ""healthy weight loss, better digestive health, promotes healthy aging, and helps curb appetite."" The drink does help with curbing appetite. However, I'm not sure if it has much impact on healthy weight loss. According to the directions, in order for that to happen, a person is supposed to drink a bottle of NEURO TRIM three times a day before each major meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It might work because by the time you pay for all the NEURO TRIM you're supposed to be drinking, there won't be any money left over to buy any actual food.",0
"One of the 4 was broken,was it necessary to send all of them back?  Other than that I loved them perfect size and great spoons.",0

"I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.",0
We absolutely love this sauce. I serve it with shrimp and basmati rice and steamed vegetables. We eat it at least once a week. We bought a pack of 12 cans because it was a little bit cheaper than in our local health store. Unfortunately most cans arrived damaged with big dents and I hope this hasn't affected the quality of the product inside the cans. The oustside packaging (Amazon packaging) wasn't damaged though!.The problem might come from the handling at the manufacturing place. Not too sure of what happened!:(,0

"Some people like lots of sugar on their cereal - ON, not IN - so this cereal should appeal to lots of people. It also has a fairly good taste, you can taste cinnamon in there and it has a nice crunch to it. One caveat though, if you want your cereal to remain crunchy in milk, pour yourself two small bowls instead of a big one, because these bits can get really soggy. But still, good taste, but not for everyone.",0
"I too wanted to love this formula because i believed it was better for my little one.  however, we also experienced issues with constipation.  my poor baby was in so much pain that she would cry.  the smell was good and the consistency was good too, however it just didn't work my baby's tummy.  we have used other formulas and she has not gotten constipated with those.  she has also been exclusively breastfed for about 3-4 months with no constipation issues.  she is now going on 5 months and i am only supplementing here and there with formula.",0
"Some of Gevalia's earlier attempts at t-discs coffee's seemed weak and watery to me.<br /><br />This is a much better effort, and provides a full 12 ounces, which is better if you want a large cup, possibly for your go cup.<br /><br />I still found it slightly not so strong and a little bitter.  Personally, I prefer their ""Dark House Blend"" as my everyday morning coffee.<br /><br />I normally drink Starbucks Pike Place coffee, so I'm used to stronger flavors but don't like it bitter.  This is only ok, but is a little less expensive, per cup.",0
"Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with ""100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E"" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?",0
"It does seam to have a little more starch than the higher priced brands. But, if it is cooked right. 2 cups of water to one cup of rice started in cold water and allowed to come to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes stirring to keep from sticking then remove from heat and cover tightly..",0
I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.,0

"I don't recommend this stuff for your big Thanksgiving dinner, but it does do well in a pinch.  I use it mainly for recipes and it's great if you're out of croutons for your salad, but to just prepare and serve on its own, well, it's very salty and I have to be quite careful what recipes I do use it in for that reason.  It has ruined recipes in the past so I do pick and choose.  Honestly Kellogg's performs much better, I prefer the seasoning and it doesn't have much salt at all.  Recommend with the above reservations.",0
"I bought this because it was sale and I was feeling hopeful. On sale it was a reasonable $4 a package. However, the rice is awful - couldn't even get past the smell to eat it (and I usually adore cumin)! The channa masala is passable. Tasty, but runny and not many chickpeas. I'll be saving the rest of the sauce for late night curry cravings, but from now on I'm sticking to my own recipe.",0
"Upon receiving this item I went in thinking these bars would be bland, I was so pleasantly surprised because they were delicious. They are gluten free which is good however if you read the ingredients they are full of sugar and carbohydrates which for someone wanting to watch their weight or having certain medical conditions they may want to avoid.",0
"If you take regular, old salted cashews and add some pepper yourself, it will taste like this.  The sea salt does not appreciably alter the taste.  However, salted cashews with pepper are a tasty snack.  Good, but nothing special.",0
"I'm a low-carb lifer, who also is a certified chocoholic, so I've tried most of the low-carb sweets on the market.  I purchased a full box of these, so I had a chance to ""live"" with them for several weeks.  I have to wonder if the other reviewers calling this ""great"" chocolate have ever actually tried anything beyond Hersheys.  Because while it's perfectly edible, it is very far from great.  Have you ever had one of those cheap chocolate bunnies they sell around Easter?  They cost $2, and taste like very cheap chocolate?  That's exactly what this tastes like.  Again, it's not horrible, and it's perfectly edible, but using the word ""great"" when describing this chocolate is like using the word ""great"" when describing a Chevy Cavalier automobile.  It's entirely inaccurate.  This tastes like cheap chocolate, but for what it is intended - low carb eating without terrible stomach distress - it does work.  But please don't buy this thinking you're getting a wonderful chocolate experience.  It's not even as good as a Nestle bar, and it's like eating tree bark compared to Recchiuti, or Fazer from Finland, or even Godiva.  Would I buy it again?  No, I'd rather eat Lindt 85% dark and take in 1-2 carbs of real chocolate.  But if I were forced to a life of sugar-free chocolate, this would be acceptable.",0

"That's pretty much what these ramen noodles has, spiciness. I love spicy noodles like the next guy but even after using only half the packet, it still leaves your mouth hot and spicy. And can barely appreciate the quality of taste these noodles are suppose to bring.<br /><br />It's like when you order the most spiciest buffalo wild wings. You cannot taste the meat but just how hot they are. The same can be said about these supposedly top brand ramen noodles.",0

I ended up purchasing the 5 pack sample from a different site, and I must say I am glad I didn't just buy a box.  Its not the worst thing I have ever drank, but its not that good.  It is sort of bitter and almost flavorless, needs lots of cream and sugar for me.",0
"How do you review a dog food that you aren't even going to taste yourself?  Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina (this product), Chef Michael's Sirloin (fancy stuff), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but Chef Michael got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the Beneful or others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give up the CM.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  The Beneful was the most colorful and interesting ""looking"", but it didn't make them appear interested. Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />As far as the next day, there was leftover Beneful, so the blue jays that look for freebies were checking it out. They liked it.  I don't think it's a bad dog food, but given the options, they were just not interested in Beneful (although I like the commercials!).<br /><br />One thing that bugged me (slightly) was that I was told that both corn and oatmeal make dogs coats itch...not sure if that's true, but Beneful seems to make a big deal out of their veggie ingredients.  Dogs are carnivores.  I couldn't help but think maybe the bag and advertising was intended to impress people with the ingredients, rather than the dogs.  They've been eating this since the Chef Michael ran out, and I didn't notice any itching, and I also didn't notice too much doggy doo-doo, which often is excessive with cheap dog food.  So I would think it's a quality product, just not in comparison.<br /><br />An unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out.",0
"Good coffee, unfortunately, there was only one month left on the sell by date (when I buy locally there's usually a year or more).",0
"I received a pack of this mix to try.  While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.

"Focusing on taste/texture alone, I'll have to say Splenda Essentials with fiber is pretty good. It doesn't have the aftertaste that many other artificial sweeteners do. From that point of view, it's a very pleasing sugar substitute.<br /><br />What irks me is the way they package this chemical, artificial product. The box makes it appear that you're getting a healthy alternative to sugar. The name alone, Splenda Essentials, makes it seem like it's a product you NEED to have a healthy diet. Then, instead of stating what it IS, a chemical, artificial sweetener, it says 'no calorie sweetener'. Still sounds healthy, right? The ingredient list even fits what a lot of people consider healthy - just three ingredients - Soluable corn fiber, maltodextrin, sucralose. Diabetics, primarily, do well to give up grains entirely. SO why use a product when the first two ingredisnts are grain derived?<br /><br />Here's what maltodextrin is: a polysaccharide that is used as a food additive. It is produced from starch by partial hydrolysis and is usually found as a creamy-white hygroscopic spraydried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose, and might be either moderately sweet or almost flavorless. It is commonly used for the production of natural sodas and candy. It can also be found as an ingredient in a variety of other processed foods.<br /><br />In further research, I found that CORN SYRUP is being relabeled as, yes, soluable corn fiber. What's the point of using an artificial sweetener that's touted as healthy, yet contains a product that's worse than sugar? Very messed up, indeed!<br /><br />Why did I give it 3 stars instead of 1? Because it DOES taste good. I'll give it that. Also, with a type 1 diabetic in the house, we do use an occasional artificial sweetener. We all hate fake tasting ones, so I think it deserves a 'like' for flavor. That said, it gets a big fat 0 for misleading marketing and labeling.",0
"I tried several of the varities to pad my orders, including the Kona Coast Chai, Lahaina Spice and Hawaiian Breakfast.<br /><br />Lahaina Spice is the best of the three, and it is between 2 and 3 stars.

"I bought a Jr Carousel gumball machine for my fiance's birthday, and with it 3 pounds of .6 inch sugar-free gumballs. The Jr Carousel Gumball machine is nice, but I am here to review the gumballs. They seem to be lacking in the flavor department, and are also pricey. Yes, they are very sweet, but they don't have very much in terms of actual flavor. All you get is the artificial sweetness. The intense taste does not last long, but this is true with all gumballs, sugar free or not. Most commercial gumballs are brightly colored and each color gumball has a different flavor; the surprise of getting a different flavor experience every time is part of the allure of putting quarters into the gumball machine. Not so with the Carousel Sugarfree gumballs: while the Carousel sugar free gumballs contain a variety of bright colors, I have yet to detect any difference in flavor between say a pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or white gumball. No assorted fruits or mints, the only flavor present in these gumballs is simply the sugar-free sweet. While they do taste good, they lose their flavor quickly and get a little boring after a while.",0

"This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little ""spicy"" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.",0

Glutino needs to fix this problem asap.,0
I love the flavor of this product and as with any k-cup coffee it is great when enjoyed right after brewing.  It's a good after dinner coffee in my opinion.,0
I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!,0

"I bought this because I wanted an instant cappuccino mix free of transfats. It's fairly tasty, but it doesn't compare well to my favorite transfat brand in terms of mouth feel. If you're accustomed to a thick, creamy powdered cappuccino mix like Land o' Lakes, you're in for disappointment. The Victorian Inn mix is thin and watery by comparison, even if you double the amount of powder used, saturating the hot water (and yet, the Victorian Inn mix packs more calories into a single serving). On the other hand, if you're accustomed to the International Coffee tins of cappuccino powder, you'll feel right at home with the Victorian Inn powder and can switch without reservation.",0
"The flavor is good, but about half of the pieces were too tough to chew. I wouldn't order this brand again.",0
"I love the taste of ginger - in foods, soda, dried and jam. The thought of a refreshing and relaxing ginger drink aroused my interest. My single sample arrived in a huge box. The ""green"" in me cringed; first warning. Then the packet had only the instruction of ""mixing with 250 ml of water"". Second warning.  How long should I steep it? no idea. When the drink was, what I thought was ready,i.e. mixed with the correct amount of hot water, I tried it - wow, the ginger taste was intense! I added 1/2 again the amount of water and reheated it. This was better, but still very powerful. I went back to the packaging to see the make-up of the product -no information was provided; a description of some of the ingredients does come on the full supply box but I did not have that to see. (I went back to the listing for this fact). Strike three. Then I checked the caloric content - still no details. Maybe that is on the box, but that was nowhere to my knowledge. The fourth and fatal blow. I cannot recommend this product as it tastes too strong, has no indication of specifically what it is made of and no caloric details. Too bad, the concept was good.",0
"The cereals taste good. The cost is not bad. I even had subscribed to it for a few months. However, the packing is worst. Every package that I received, the plastic bag containing the cereals are open or teared. I think it is just a poor quality plastic bags that they are using. It is happening to every package I am receiving. So, finally I cancelled my subscription.",0

"I ordered this tea along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was the best of the lot, though that's not saying much.  From what I've experienced and what I've seen in some other reviews of Roland teas, the flavoring is really weak on all of their flavored teas.  Well, OK, faint is perhaps being to kind.  Non existent is really more correct.  Russian tea is supposed to have a smokey taste that some people are put off by.  The flavor of this tea is very faint, fainter than I was expecting and fainter than I would have liked.  The other Roland teas I got were disappointingly weakly flavored and weren't worth getting.  This one at least has some flavor.",0

"Decided to try Madhouse Munchies based on the description and the positive reviews.  No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it.",0
Not made in New York!! Why Not?<br /><br />The package is not reclosable.<br /><br />Great taste.,0
"I love flavored coffees.  This one is supposed to be vanilla nut.  As I'm drinking it this morning, there is neither vanilla nor nut, either by aroma or by taste.  In that sense, this coffee is a complete disappointment for me.  It will get a three star rating, nevertheless, for two other reasons.  This is a good morning breakfast coffee despite the complete lack of flavor.  Secondly, about a month ago Amazon ran this for $13.84 for the three 12-ounce packages, including super saver shipping, which made it a fairly good purchase.  Currently, Amazon has the price back up around $20, which is too much for me given the quality, or, rather, lack thereof.",0

"Well I got this tree a few weeks ago and the leaves started to turn yellow as is normal. The tree has only been kept inside with NO other plants and under a full spectrum light. It now has aphids and a fungus and unfortunately isn't looking too well.<br /><br />Update: The plant is still alive a few months later. It was a constant battle with the aphids until I finally put the bonsai tree outdoors and a swarm of lady bugs devoured all of them haha. The one issue I'm still having is that I can not get this thing to produce the berries its supposed to. About a dozen or so flower will bud and then die after blooming.<br /><br />As a tip to other buyers, remove the moss on top of the soil IMMEDIATELY and water it every day. The soil should be damp all the time. If your leaves are drooping or turning yellow, it needs more water.",0

"I like cold breakfast cereal and usually have four to five different boxes in the kitchen cabinet most of the time.  I also like the flavor of peanuts, so I figured this product would be worth trying.<br /><br />The flakes reminded me of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes -- very crisp, very sweet.  I tried it with milk for the first time for breakfast. I found the flavor of peanuts at breakfast was not very enjoyable.  The next day, I tried eating some as a snack, right out of the box.  It was in the late afternoon.  As a snack at this time of day, the product was far more enjoyable.  I also tried it sprinkled on vanilla ice cream, which was good.<br /><br />The combination of ultra sweetness and peanuts didn't work for me early in the morning.  But thinking of it as a snack and using it apart from its traditional intent, I found it tasty and satisfying.",0
"Hi,<br /><br />Didn't think these were as good as the other ones of the same brand.",0
"I have 3 different flavors on these and they are : jalape&ntilde;o , apple wood ,a and hickory. I so far think hickory has the best smoke taste but apple wood has more bacon flavor. Jalape&ntilde;o is good but not the best . All these products do and will add complex flavor to your food. They add great smoke and subtle bacon flavor. You can smell the bacon and taste it on most foods. I think it is the best on chicken. I disagree with the people that say there is hardly any bacon flavor and I think you guys have poor palates. Do not expect this to make your food taste like it was wrapped by 90 pieces of bacon for Pete's sake! No seasoning is meant to achieve this level of flavor and if you want full bacon taste then buy bacon and eat it! But JD's bacon products are amazing and my wife and I love it on most BBQ meats and I like to add it to chili's and anything you wish to add extra flavor to. Highly recomended and it will always be in my spice cupboard .",0
"This cereal tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios, but I don't care for the artificial, sugary smell when you first open the box. That plus it leaves the milk looking a beige, peanutty mess! Still the taste is good, just nothing new, unexpected or exciting. Just your basic nutty cereal.",0
"After transitioning from Natural Balance Duck and Potato, we've gone through several bags of Sojo's Turkey over the course of several months, so I feel I can write a fair review.<br /><br />Our dogs are small poodle mixes, rescue dogs, weighing 10 lb., 10 lb. and 7 lb. We follow the Sojo instructions mixing water to food in the recommended 2:1 ratio. We feed twice a day. I've spoken to customer service a few times with questions and they've been super nice, although they didn't always have helpful answers.<br /><br />Impressions: The food smells great (even to me!) and the dogs go bonkers for it. They love every bite.<br />Sojo's has variable consistency - some bags were a powdery consistency - creating a mush when mixed with water. These are the best bags - everything becomes part of the thick mush.<br />Other bags have big chopped pieces of veggies/meat - these are not my favorite bags. The added water hydrates the pieces and then creates a ton of watery gravy - too much fluid to feed the dogs.<br /><br />After a month our dogs each lost a pound of body weight. They had no body fat to lose so it was a bit distressing. They warn that fat/weight will come off a dog after switching to Sojo's and then an appropriate amount of weight will be gained back. Our dogs never gained it back. I was feeding the amount recommended for dogs up to 12 lbs (which should be more than enough food for our pups).<br /><br />Despite this, for an hour or two before each meal time all three pups were clearly in distress - shaking, quivering, starving. This went on for many weeks before I decided there is something lacking in this food. (I didn't know if this was excitement for the yummy food or actual weakness/lack of energy, so I gave it some time.) I even tried feeding more than the 12 lb. dog amount - enough to supposedly sustain a much bigger dog - and still they were quivering and weak (and our dog food budget was taking a big hit).<br /><br />I have slowly transitioned them back to a mix of Sojo's and Natural Balance (ratio of 2:1). Now our pups are happy again, they aren't shaking and panicked at meal time.<br /><br />The claim that dogs will have better teeth and better breath... Sojo's breath does seem a bit nicer (due to the parsley I assume) but their teeth were not cleaner. I imagine a professional cleaning plus feeding Sojo's exclusively might result in teeth staying cleaner. Feeding this food doesn't change the current cleanliness of their teeth (though their customer service rep tried to spin it this way).<br /><br />Sojo's has high water content so our dogs urinated constantly. That's a good thing for their kidneys, but a bad thing for our little guy who can't hold his pee. He had a million accidents while on Sojo's.<br /><br />Sojo's has high fiber content so our dogs became poop machines. Non-stop poop makers. This is good for their anal glands, but it really gave me and our septic system a run for its money (we dispose of their feces in the toilet). Tell-tale was the comment by our groomer when we picked up our little 7 pounder: ""He did a human size poop. How did he have all that in him?"" Exactly. That's Sojo's.<br /><br />And the worst, most telling, example that Sojo's didn't provide adequate nutrition... About 4 hours after eating, our little guy would go out to the dog yard and chew on old Sojo's poop. There are visible bits of undigested veggies in Sojo's poop and he would pick them apart and eat them. He was starving. Now that Natural Balance is mixed into his meals he no longer eats poop. He's happy and content. [Only on an all-Sojo's diet did he have this pica behavior. The veggie bits are still in the feces, but he has no interest and no need to eat them. Another spin from customer service: ""The dogs love Sojo's so much I've heard they will eat the poop."" Now we know the pica behavior is driven by hunger, not passion.]<br /><br />I equate Sojo's to the old saying about eating Chinese food ""two hours later, you're hungry"".<br /><br />In any case, I think we're all very happy now with the mix of food. They have lots of yummy veggies, some turkey and the kibble that sustains them. I wish Sojo's was enough, but it's not. I'm glad to have found a solution without giving up Sojo's altogether. And so are our dogs.",0
"I love licorice and try to drink pomogranate juice daily, but the flavor of this licorice was not for me. It reminded me a little of a 'perfumey' artificial grape taste, perhaps because of the elderberry extract listed in the ingredienct list before pomegranate juice is. I actually like elderberries so am not sure why I didn't like this better than I did. The texture was okay, a bit chewier than traditional red vines and more like those long licorice ropes. I didn't detest it, but I can't say I particularly liked it, either. The product is made in Mexico and certified organic by Oregon Tilth. I'd stick with the black licorice flavor when ordering this brand.",0

"Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a creamy dressing for salad or tacos. It is a thick dressing, medium hot, with a slight egg & strong mayo-salt flavor. 100 out of 110 calories come from fat-so this is not health food.  I think it is tasty, but not delicious. However, it should go well with taco's if not over applied. Of course, IMO adding your own fresh Jalapeno's and fresh sour cream to your taco will taste much better then using this dressing.<br /><br />It is doubtful, I would buy it with all the many (better & more healthy) alternative dressings on the market.",0
"My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??",0
"I like the idea of this product: an alcoholic beverage with no alcohol and one that's just 5 calories. Of course, that's also this products downfall: it's a ""mock"" beverage meaning you should expect this to be an imitation of the real thing and for the taste to be odd or off. For me, this isn't something I'd buy after sampling it: it has a bit of a kick and an odd aftertaste that simply turned me off after a few sips.",0
"I should preface this review by noting that I consider myself a Big Red connoisseur...I think I probably drank the stuff out of my baby bottle.  I really love the stuff, and grew up drinking it out of bottles, made ice cream out of it...you name it, I tried it.  However, as I get older I prefer not to consume quite so many calories if I can.  What can I say, there is nothing like the real thing.  I had hopes that the ""zero"" version might be closer to the actual sugary version, but not so (I do realize that most diet sodas taste nothing like their full-sugared counterparts, but I was hopeful).  It still tastes very much of artificial sweetener and I did not notice much of a difference between this and the plain old diet version.  Go for the real thing if you can!  Nonetheless, thank you Amazon for mailing soda to Hawaii!",0
"I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well.",0

"These Honey Flavored Hard Pieces tasted okay if you like honey. Actually, I used them when I had a sore throat and thought the honey filled center soothed my throat for a time.

I think they should repackage them for sore throats :)",0

"I've tried both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Megafudge</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0"">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)",0

"It's very disappointing that the original version of this is no longer available.  The ""2"" version, which I received, too, isn't nearly as good.<br /><br />I did contact Amazon CS by email and phone before ordering and they told me I'd get the right one, but I didn't.<br /><br />At this point, even though the ""2"" version isn't as good, I don't know of a better one, so I'll probably reorder now since I'm running low.<br /><br />Wrigley, please bring back the original!",0
"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",0
"We usually buy our dog food from the feed store, in very large bags.  When the Beneful Originial Dog Food arrived, I was impressed by the colorful bits and the chewy chunks, which looked more appealing than the all-brown food we usually buy.<br /><br />However, when I compared the actual ingredients and nutrients, they really are about the same.  Purina's Beneful had a number one ingredient of Ground Corn, a number 2 of chicken by-product, and then more grains before the seventh ingredient of beef.  Our usual food has a number one ingredient of Chicken, then corn meal and several grains, with beef also as the seventh ingredient.  So far, that puts my food a bit ahead of the Beneful, as we prefer that meat be the first ingredient in our dog foods rather than corn.<br /><br />I felt the Beneful food to see if there really were chewy chunks in there.  Beneful has a higher moisture content than our food (14% compared to 10%) and there are some chunks that I can squeeze a bit.  That's one point for the Beneful.<br /><br />When I compared the calories, they were essentially the same.  Beneful has 360 kcal/cup and ours has 350 kcal/cup.  The breakdown of protein, fat, and other vitamins were a wash.  Beneful might be higher on this one a bit, but then it'd be lower on the next one.  Beneful had a few minerals that ours didn't list, but ours had some minerals that Beneful didn't list. Beneful DID have 3% more crude protein than our food, which may tip the score in Beneful's favor once again.<br /><br />In the end, our dog enjoys the Beneful, but I don't feel it is that much better than the food we currently buy.  We can purchase our food less expensively than the Beneful, so we will continue to use our feedstore dog food once this bag of Beneful is finished.",0

"My dog has been on a healthy dogfood regimen since I got her as a rescue several years ago. I do give her table scraps in moderation, so it's not like she's being tortured by healthy kibble.<br /><br />I figured to mix in the Beneful with her regular food. Not a good idea. She loves it (but then she'll pretty much scarf down anything that doesn't outrun her.) She's been having gas problems ever since I started mixing the foods together.<br /><br />She also seems uncomfortable, like she's got a tummy ache. Corn is the biggest ingredient, so maybe that's the problem; her kibble has meat as the first.<br /><br />I packed up the Beneful (comes in a great resealable bag, which I wish the healthy kibble company would emulate) and sent it off to the dog shelter. I hope some of the pups there can appreciate it more than my dog.",0
"I'm not a huge chocolate eater.  I don't care much for overly rich chocolates, but I do enjoy semi-sweet dark chocolates (like Hershey's) and eat them often, even if not in huge quantities.  The Newman's dark chocolate wasn't quite as tasty to me.  As other reviewers have noted, it has a rather waxy texture to it that sort of threw me off.  I felt like I couldn't taste the flavor as well because it was too smooth and waxy.  Overall it was more bitter compared to the Hershey's.  And while that may suit some people, it wasn't quite my cup of tea.  I'll stick with my semi-sweets and let the real dark chocolate lovers have the Newman's.",0

"Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.",0

"I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says ""That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness"".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.",0

As for dandruff, it really does not seem to work as good as the stronger selsun blue.<br /><br />On this bottle it says it has ginseng, tea tree and natural mint - none of those fragrances were apparent to us. The shampoo itself is extremely thick; it takes twice the amount of time to rinse out as most other shampoos. It almost feels and acts like it has some conditioner in it. Our hair does seem thicker and fuller. I really cannot say that it is worth the extra price than most other shampoos, but it still is a good shampoo, just not necessarily a good dandruff shampoo.",0
On the package it only says English walnut halves so not sure if they are raw or not.

"What is ""four ears up""?  Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1"" x 2"" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the ""four ears up"".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an ""8 ears up"" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a ""four ears up"" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.",0
"Not my favorite Madhava Agave Nectar flavor, but I haven't tried it on fruit yet- just tasted it from the foil liner.  It's still nice to  have options with sweetening (I'm a diabetic).  I don't drink sweetened tea, but it might be good for that :)",0
I've fed my dog several packages of the chicken jerky and she really liked them.

At the time I noted that there was also Aloe Pulp Juice available so this time I tried a couple more bottles without even thinking about it. That was a mistake. I opened a bottle of ice  cold juice and too a swig. It was much too sweet! Some people might like it, I would hasten to add, but not me. I prefer drinks to be light, refreshing and almost sweet free. This stuff is like drinking concentrated sugar water. Well, I looked at the ingredients and it contains sugar cane syrup and honey. No wonder! If sugars and calories (this bottle contains 220) are not a problem, then you might enjoy this drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0

"Everyone has different tastes and likes so for that reason I've rated this 3 out of 5. Personally, the taste is quite yucky.. like a super sweet something or medicine like taste.. Perhaps some people will be ok with that. I wouldnt mind it IF the product gave me some energy as it states. I felt no difference. I use 6 hour energy drinks and  Mio to compare the product too and both those products (although tastes may not be the best) worked very well giving a boost of energy. This bottle is alot bigger too, and only a squeeze is suppose to do the job. Like any product as such I would recommend trying it out once as it may be ok for you or it may not.<br /><br />I personally like the smaller portable bottles. Another thing it needs to be used within 30 days of opening...... something to keep in mind so your forced to use it on a daily basis or it will go bad.",0

"My 8 y.o. son and I tested two The Switch beverages--this flavor and Kiwi-Berry.  I think we both preferred the latter.  Although, my son seemed to like both.  My thought is this is because they are both quite sweet.  While the Kiwi Berry had a pleasant taste, this one tasted not so much like real watermelons or strawberries as it did the artificial imitations of those flavors one finds in candies.  I can see how this would appeal to a child.  But, as an adult, I found it odd to be drinking a beverage--and one advertised as a healthy alternative to soda (not so much)--that reminded me of my childhood addiction to Jolly Ranchers.

"Dragon Pearl tea is one of my favorite types of tea. I drink Dragon Pearl several times a week, so this is coming from my experience of a variety of different brands. My favorite Dragon Pearl I buy from a local herb shop for $7/oz. It's fresh, highly aromatic and tastes wonderful.<br /><br />When I came across this deal at $9 for 4oz, I was curious enough to give it a try. When I first opened the canister, it had the floral-filled aroma I was expecting, albeit not as potent as I am accustomed to. I was about to make my first cup of tea, when I noticed a hair inside. Grabbing a hold of it, I pulled out a 10"" long strand of black hair. My first instinct was to return it, but I didn't. I hope whoever was working that day hand-rolling my tea was at least a bit hygienic.<br /><br />The tea itself once brewed was weak. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, just significantly weaker than I am used to. If you're looking for a nice, inexpensive gift for someone, this would fit the bill nicely - sans hair, hopefully. However, if you're looking for an impressive Dragon Pearl tea for someone used to drinking it, they will probably be a bit disappointed. I'll probably finish the can, and then head back to my herb shop.",0
"I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.",0
"The upside is, the tomatoes grow. The downside is, there are only *three* packages of cherry tomatoes--the rest are ""spacers"". Admittedly, they take up a lot of room, but I think I can manage that on my own! Each tomato plant costs about $7, which is outrageous. They had better yield a hell of a lot of tomatoes.",0
"I like the fact that there are no artifical dyes or coloring added.  It doesn't make my cat sick, he has finally stopped throwing up.  The only problem is he really isn't too fond of it.  I can't feed him this on a daily basis.  I use it alternating with other foods.  If your cat isn't real picky, it is a great choice.",0
"These are good, but the chocolate coating is a bit waxy and the chocolate could be more chocolaty.  The chocolate kind reminds me of a heftier version of the chocolate coating that Hostess or Little Debbie cakes have as an icing on their products.",0
"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",0
"If ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years (as the popular myth states), this one is the most likely. It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that I've swallowed more than half the sticks I've chewed is not a pleasant thought.",0
"i love graham crackers and these were just ok.<br />they were a little dense for me and really didn't have that ""graham"" taste like the normal ones you find in the store.<br /><br />they weren't horrible but they weren't my favorite.  i would buy them only if the store was completely out of normal graham crackers.<br /><br />i just didn't care for the dense feeling, the lack of ""grahamy"" taste and just the overall graham cracker feeling.",0
It does record with ease and decent quality for the price. The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.,0
I like so much these biscuits. They're so great but there was a little space of time (I think) where heat caused cookies were pasted each other. Is not a good idea to ask for chocolate or something like that.,0
"I bought 8 of these when they were $1.75 and on sale for 4 for the price of 3.  I would buy Dingo Dental Munchy Stix 10-Sticks, 3.1-Ounce again at that price because my dogs do like them.  However, the price since went up to $7.70, then to $6.24 for a single package.  They should sell several packages at that price.  NOT WORTH anything close to that price, especially when you can buy them in the store for $1.52.<br /><br />Also, they don't freshen either of my dogs' breath much at all (even after going through about 10 packages of them), so they're just like a regular treat in that respect.  For breath freshening (but not teeth cleaning) Chocolick Mints work well (not real chocolate, but you are giving your dog the taste for chocolate, not really a good thing, either).",0
"The pastachio mixed in the halva are either rotten, old, or burnt. Last week I notified the company in Israel via e-mail and told them same. No answer yet. As you  will note from my account we bought two cases, but dissappointed with poor quality nuts used. We love halva and unless things improve we will stop ordering same. I always believe ""Good quality products always brings good profits"". The converse of which leads to business demise!.",0
After reading some of the first reviews I almost did not try this. A week later and some better reviews I decided too try it myself. What I found was MiO is delicious when drank; but for me this left an almost numb like sensation on my tongue which went away as soon as I ate something. Maybe I had some reaction but I found it minor but noticeable. That aside it is convenient in that you decide how much flavoring you will have in your drink by the amount  that you dispense into your water.  The flavor is as good as any instant drink mix. And is the easiest additive for a flavored drink I have used. I will not get this again but it is worth a try.,0
"Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.",0
I only have one major issue. Because of the texture of jerky in general it really gets stuck in your teeth and becomes a bit of a chore to eat.,0
"If you like then then you would love Orange Crush. A friend got this for me while he was down south (lower 49 states). They sell as 4 pack for $20 = $5 a bottle, way over price when you can get (basically) the same thing for $1 a liter.<br /><br />Over all, I think the price is for the bottle, not the content.",0
"The title says it all, the flavor is just ok, no real OOOOO factor.<br />It doesn't really taste like creme brulee, for those who know that that tastes like.<br />It's kind of caramel-ish with a burnt aftertaste, not my favorite.<br />We're stuck with a whole extra box that we'll probably only drink when we're desperate.<br />If you want a GREAT cup of dessert coffee go with Timothy's German Chocolate Cake, you wont be disappointed!",0
"I got these treats for my extra large Chihuahua who will eat anything.  She wasn't a fan of these.  Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a ""snackee"" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a ""snackee"" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away.",0
"This cake was no better than a Duncan Hines cake mix. Not extra moist. Not extra chocolately. Just ordinary. Certainly not worth $10. And the cake mix bag was torn so there was cake mix everywhere, a complete mess.",0

"It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.<br /><br />I liked it except for the licorice flavor.",0
"Krave is okay, but not great. I liked it more as a snack than as a cereal. The crunchy whole grain outer covering is an unusual flavor, not like anything else I've ever tasted. Maybe the problem I had with it was that I wanted it to taste like graham crackers. The chocolate inside is okay but not spectacular. What I see is a bold marketing campaign promoting a mediocre food.",0
"I was hoping the scent of these bags would help keep the dog poop stink down, but the scent fades quickly after you open the bag of eight rolls. What a shame.",0
"I added a package of the lipton to go to a 16.9 oz water bottle like the instructions say. I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky.",0
"First I want to be clear; the coffee itself is great, or would be, if it arrived correctly. The coffee comes in a vacuum-sealed package (or is supposed to come like that). This is to keep the beans fresh, and after the package is opened, you're supposed to store it in the freezer, to continue to keep the beans fresh.<br /><br />The problem is, the packages you receive are not vacuum-sealed. The seals are broken and the beans are at some degree of staleness on arrival. You don't know how stale they are because you don't know how long it's been since the vacuum seals were broken. It still tastes like coffee, you can still taste the macadamia and the chocolate, but you can also tell that it's a bit off-flavor as well.<br /><br />This is a great coffee, but don't purchase it through this seller unless you don't mind receiving stale beans.",0
"This cereal is faintly sweet, it suits an adult palate- not like the sugar blasted types that come in brightly colored boxes. The squares are a good size, not too big, and they hold milk nicely. The overall taste was rather bland, I really did not notice any brown sugar. I did like the fact that they are made of oatmeal for the cholesterol lowering properties. I did feel fuller than I do after having a breakfast of the flake cereal variety. It's a satisfying good, basic, cereal.",0
"The popped corn was very small and didn't seem to have a lot of corn flavor,  Ok, but dissappointing.",0

"These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.",0
Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.,0
"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",0
"This jumped-up cookie-wannabe really is taking things a little too far. McVitie's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJD5LQ"">Hobnobs</a> are already a mite sweeter than many British biscuits and many believe that they already pander a little too much to modern American-influenced tastes ever to truly qualify as a proper biscuit. To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton (who will want the 12-pack).<br /><br />Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a ""proper"" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube.  Hmmm...",0
"My cat cannot get enough of this food - so it must taste great.<br /><br />With this as her regular diet, she gained 3lbs in a year; my vet said this is a fattening food.  I still give her individual pieces of kibble as ""treats"" but I feed her Blue Buffalo weight control now.",0

"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.

"I found this ginger-lemon tea to be so-so. Although I mixed the powder and water quite well, I found the taste inconsistent.  Some sips had an overpowering ginger taste.  Other times the flavor was more moderate and the lemon taste was reflected.  In the end, I found that this had too strong of an aftertaste, a sensation similar to that experienced with some artificial sweeteners.  If you like Gold-kilis other products, or if you like very strong ginger flavored drinks, this is for you.  If not, you may wish to try another product.",0
"A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00416L8OQ"">Gaggia for Illy Espresso Machine</a> that works with illy single-serve pods <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRE5D8"">illy iperEspresso Capsules Dark Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRAWCQ"">illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a>.  I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM"">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the ""caffe"" and the ""cappuccino"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast; the coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly like you feared it would:  Coffee with that ""special"" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The caffe was not a drink to be chugged down.  It is suited to sipping as it is not a thirst-quencher.  With the first few sips, I noticed a pronounced tangy flavor that I did not care for.  By the time I got half-way through the can, I had pretty much gotten used to the tang and it didn't bother me.I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set them in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste.",0

"I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.  Next time, I'll go for a medium or dark roast.  I think it was the medium that I had before and I really liked it.",0
What a great idea.  I was convinced this was the answer to my cat/pill problems.  So with great anticipation..I gave this to my cat.  She sniffed at it and gave me a dirty look and walked away.  Didnt work with my cat.  Shes on to me.  Will try something else.  But I really like the idea of this product and it may work for other cats.  So I gave it three stars for that reason.,0
"The product comes as a hard and apparently concentrated solid. It's similar to Artisana ""coconut butter."" Both products are harder than butter at room temperature, so a better description might be ""coconut tallow"" or ""coconut wax"" (no offense intended, those are just what it reminds me most of). The package says to add 2 Tbsps of hot water to 1 Tbsp Creamed Coconut and stir briskly until dissolved, which was a surprise, because the product was recommended on a raw forum. Being a high raw omnivore myself I'm also not used to foods that need some heat and processing and have instructions and I figured others might be served by this warning, as I tasted some without first diluting it and that was a horrible experience.<br /><br />I followed the instructions and found it wouldn't dissolve without first breaking up the chunks into tiny bits. You can also melt the whole package contents in a bowl of hot water, as a commenter kindly explained to me. The result was still too thick, drying, and gluey and it needed more water. I added two more tablespoons and it was less bad, but I still didn't care much for it. It has a sawdust-like texture and the gritty bits stuck in my throat and the taste was unpleasant--like coconut that's been heat-dried and stored for months. Not surprisingly, the package says the product is dehydrated.<br /><br />This and the similar Artisana coconut butters are some of the least pleasant foods I've ever tried and I'm puzzled why people like them. If you care to explain why you like it, feel free to comment, because I know some people love it. For those that like this sort of product, I think they might like this one OK, so even though I would give it one star, I compromised and gave it 3. Top quality coconut water, coconut candy bars and coconut sorbet remain my favorite-tasting packaged coconut foods.",0
"I love Ritz crackers, the ""Original"" type. However, and this is in no way Amazon's fault, the manufacturer somehow have them mixed up with the low-sodium variety, which are quite blah, and I've been lucky to get one original stack out of the three in the box. Will I order again? Of course, and hope for better luck next time!",0

I have used San Giogio brand ditalini to provide the pasta base for this dish. And this ditalini does its job well. It is not the best pasta I have tasted in this dish, but it is readily available and comes at a good price.<br /><br />All in all, this meets my needs for this dish nicely.",0
"When I saw this PETITE CUISINE GRILLED TUNA TREATS product for cats, I KNEW I had to let me Muffin, Ginger and Peaches try it for themselves. I'm all about feeding them healthy and the omega-3/omega-6 fats in this were a huge plus in my book. When I opened up the package, I was impressed to see the tuna actually looked like tuna and not some fake tuna-like substance. And there was a little zip lock on it so you could portion out the amount of treats for your feline friends and then reseal it. Cool. But what was not-so-cool was just how messy it was to take out of the bag, dripping wet and splashing all over the front of my shirt, big long chunks that has to be broken up by hand before sharing with my cats. While they devoured this special treat as soon as it hit the floor, their owner was busy washing his soiled shirt and trying to get that awful ""fishy"" smell off of his hands. There's got to be a better way to get the treat chunks into smaller pieces and not so messy...maybe individually wrapping each bite-sized portion would be better. It's not a bad product, but it could be better.",0
"Bought this expecting PACKS of gum (since that's what it showed with no other info at the time). Instead you are sent 4 cylinder type containers with 60 pieces of loose gum in them.

This same item listed here you can get from the  website at $14.95 a cube.  I really recommend looking elsewhere before purchasing this one which is 10 over a price I have found it elsewhere.

"The GOOD news is that this Comstock Apple pie filling has 60% fewer calories than Comstock's regular apple filling and it's really tasty.  1/3 of a cup has only 35 calories so that this would make a good pie for the holidays for people on a diet.  Sweetened with Sucralose (i.e. Splenda) it's made with one of the healthier artificial sweetners.<br /><br />The Bad news -- at least for moms like me -- is that there aren't any vitamins in this pie mixture.  0% Vitamins A and C.  Zero percent% Calcium and iron.<br /><br />Now, glancing over some health sites on the internet I find that what you can expect from a 'freshly' made apple pie is something like 2-to-4% of daily requirements of Vitamin A per slice, and 4-to-6% Vitamin C; and 4-to-10% of daily Iron.  So something is lost in the processing of this product.  Something that I was hoping to fill my family with... good nutrition.<br /><br />This is important for me because I have one of those kids who disparages fruits and veggies, but who will eat pie.  It's for him and his sister that I bake pies.  If there's no vitamins there doesn't seem to be a point in making them.  I could easily buy cookies which don't require preparation.<br /><br />SUMMARY::<br />I won't be buying this mix again.  At least not until the kids go off to college.  At that point I might make it for my husband and myself on the rare occasion, as the lower calorie count and lack of sugar makes this pie filling very attractive for us.",0

"i just got my Gourmet Popcorn Variety 3-pack (45 oz per pack) and wanted to make sure that other potential purchasers were aware of what they were buying.  There are three plastic bottles of popcorn in the package.  Each bottle contains 15 ounces of popcorn for  a total of 45 ounces for the entire order.  When I ordered the popcorn, I thought I was getting 3 45 ounce containers.  This would be a little over 3 dollars per pound which is reasonable for gourmet popcorn.  Instead this works out to somewhat more than 10 dollars per pound.  I considered returning it, but as a popcorn lover, I decided to keep it.  I may amend my review after popping some of it to see if it's worth the price.",0

It was fine that way, but I'd be curious if I ordered the granola in a chillier season what it would be like.<br /><br />The granola is fine, the dark chocolate is a fine perk, but it does feel like there's something missing.  The sweetners for the most part are natural sweetners.  Still I can't figure it out, something was missing, it's okay, not great.",0
"There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very ""Starbucks-y"" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.  Unless you're running a caf&eacute;.",0
"My 2 cats are picky tuna lovers and this was all that was available at the time. They still love this, but the smelly fish scent is very strong and the kitchen smells for a bit after they eat it.

"I was surprised at the strength of this coffee's flavor.  I have to mix with ""regular"" coffee or it is too overwhelming.  Not a problem, just had to play with the mix a bit.

I wish I didn't have to order 4 bags at a time, with mixing the coffee it will take me a lot of time to get through 4 bags.",0
"Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some ""healthy"" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.",0
"I have tried a few of the new flavors of Taco Bell's new sauces, and this one is very, very average. The best I can describe it is the flavor of your standard taco seasoning - slightly zesty but never hot - coupled with a very mild ranch flavor. The texture is decently creamy (the consistency, say, of sour cream). It's lighter flavor pairs it best with white meat, but I think it is just zesty enough to stand up to beef also. Overall, this is a decent sauce if you are going for a pretty standard taco seasoning. But if you want spicy or a rich boldness, this sauce definitely is not for you.",0

The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness"".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.",0
"Unfortunatly my cat would not eat it, and he is not that picky. I gave almost all the cans to a friends of mine who has 3 cats, she said they would not eat it either. Bad batch? I do not know.... Would not buy it again....",0
I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.,0
"Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note. I was not as taken by the strength of the blend.  Mild to bland would be my comment there. All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay",0
"I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did.",0
"The cereal had an impressive ingredient list, but the texture was a little off, and it's way too sweet.  The second ingredient on the list, ahead of most of the healthful ingredients, was sugar (organic cane sugar).  The cereal was so sweet, I felt like I was eating a dessert.",0
"They would eat some of it, but not finish it which they do if they really like the food. It is very easy to open and feed as you just squeeze the pouch.",0
"This Habanero sauce is potent! Only a few drops are needed to add a lot of heat to any dish. The Habanero pepper is very hot so it is hardly a surprise this sauce is quite potent (the habanero chile is likely the hottest pepper you'll ever find in any grocery store).<br /><br />This sauce is OK - It is similar to Tabasco in terms of its potency but I prefer it far more because it has no vinegar and tomatoes have been added to the mix.<br /><br />This sauce is potent, adds a great deal of heat to any dish with just a few drops. It has a very subtle sweet tomato flavor to it and has no vinegar notes. Considerable heat along with a vague hint of some tomato sweetness are its major flavor notes. The tomato taste and its sweetness however are quite subtle.<br /><br />I think this is a good hot sauce but certainly not a great one.  A true 2 or 3 star product. Primarily it delivers heat - and just that!!! Yet it has no real flaws either.<br /><br />Watch out for sellers who offer a low product price combined with high shipping charges.",0
"This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.",0
"It's ok, my son eats it, he loves the carrots, he eats all of it. I'm going to move onto stage 3 foods.",0
"The chocolate drink has great flavor and not too sweet.  The best part is no refrigiration needed, especially for little kids' lunch drink during summer or winter!  Once in awhile, it's ok to drink these lowfat chocolate milk, but the sugar content per box is 6 tsp of sugar - OUCH!  The least sugar is the lowfat milk of all the 4 flavors, has 3 tsp sugar!  Fast delivery, too!  I would still recommend these drinks as lunch drink at school (alternate with milk), better than the cafeteria ones :)  5 star for fast service & good price, 3 star for sugar content.",0
"We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.",0
"In store, I found them for about 4 more dollars, and about 6x the amount of hot fries. The bags are just too small.",0
"When I bought these I thought I was getting pimientos, but they are just bell peppers. Not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just not what I wanted to get. This company needs to be more accurate in its labeling.",0
I ordered three boxes of Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies but received three boxes of Dare Brand maple cookies.  Both brands were sold by the same company.I understand now that they were out of the Maple Farms brand so switched to the Dare brand.  Why didn't they tell me they were out of the Maple Farms brand when I ordered??  Won't buy again if this is the way they do business.,0
"I like quite a few of the Teeccino flavors, and although I like hazelnut, I don't care for this Teeccino flavor much on its own.  Not a fan straight and unsweetened, or sweetened.  However, I've gotten accustomed to adding 250 mg of vitamin C (1/2 a 500 mg tablet) to this flavor as almost a bitter-sweetener.  It changes the flavor profile to something I quite like, but I'm not sure it is what anyone else would like, and not what you would expect of a hazelnut flavored coffee substitute.<br /><br />I'll strongly recommend Teeccino's Chocolate Mint flavor, however.",0
"The Good:  Fiber One Bars taste great, are high in Fiber, and are a filling snack between meals<br /><br />The Bad:  Causes extreme gas, like nothing I have eaten before, and some minor stomach cramps.",0
"This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat. My cat does not like it and I am stuck with a big bag. This is a bargain brand, and gets the job done.",0
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:48 Mins<br /><br /></span>This white tea is good quality, but is not worth the money, I purchased once to test out a different brand, I do very much like the containers, though I will only buy this if the other brands are out of stock. Potrero Tea, organic silver needle, is superior in my opinion.",0
"I had thought I was getting a good deal, thinking that the boxes would be the standard ""candy bar"" size. But sadly all you get is 24 small boxes marked with a retail price of $0.25. So for $9.45 you get $6.00 worth of candy. Sad, very sad...",0
"I am a fan of the double bergamot stash earl grey from stores in packs of 18.  This bulk box does not contain the same quality product.  I don't know if it just sits around too long, or my order contained an off-season batch, but when you can go to target and get the same 100 bags for about $1 more than the subscribe and save price for a better product, why buy in bulk?",0
"I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good. After watching a demonstration on the benefits of purifying the water that comes into my home I can see that drinking from my tap is not an option. However, as much as I like the Essentia water I am not convinced it is so much better than other bottle water that is certainly more affordable.",0
I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.,0
The candy was fresh and well packaged but not all that sour. It was certainly more sour than regular airheads but not sour enough for those who want an extreme sour experience.,0
"So many brews, so little time.  First, like with many of the cheaper brands, the bag doesn't open easily- tends to rip. It, of course, has little flaps to close it up.<br /><br />Once opened, it produces a deep and rich smell- for those who simply enjoy, can I say, the bouquet of coffee.  Tastewise-what can I say?  People prefer different brands for different reasons.  For the most part, one knows immediately if this cup suits them. This one is nothing stellar at least not in our house.  At least it wasn't bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />Definitely will drink if nothing else left in cupboard.  Not bad, but simply, not our cup of coffee.",0
"I'm not a gourmet, just someone who looks forward to her morning latte. I typically make a 12-oz latte with a single shot.  I like saving money by making my own lattes, but don't want to take the time or deal with the mess of grinding beans, so I prefer pods. I recently bought a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG"">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>, and was inspired to expand my horizons beyond Starbucks espresso pods, so I tried a few different brands. Given the price, I expected these to be very good, but was unimpressed.  The taste is not significantly less bitter than Starbucks, and the aroma less appetizing. They do give a good pull in my machine, but to me are not worth the price premium.  These are E.S.E espresso pods, made for espresso machines with E.S.E pod adapters. They are not for Senseo or K-cups machines.",0
"These leak.<br />You'll most likely have a bit of a mess in the machine, but not bad.  Some of the ground coffee will end up in your cup.<br />Still, I like the idea, and have found it to be a huge help to put a small square of aluminum foil between the cup and lid, to make a better seal.<br /><br />On caps' own merits, aluminum foil squares (folded once) actually worked better.  Together it's a pretty good solution.  It takes away from the whole point of k-cups, but sometimes it's nice to save money or use your own coffee.",0
I ordered several of these candies in different flavors.  They were NOT made in France as stated.  These were used as favors for a french themed event.  Unfortunately it was too late to return them before the event.  Sadly I was disappointed.  We used them anyway and hoped that people didn't notice that they were made in Spain.,0
"I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a ""slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.",0
I have purchased several different types of Nature Valley Granola bars<br />especially for my college aged kids. I was rather disappointed at this selection as there were only two varieties in the box  Oatmeal Raisin and Chocolate Chunk.<br />The Oatmeal Raisin bars were fine but the Chocolate Chunk in several of the bars had only ONE chunk and at most two. I do not know if this was a manufacturing error on Nature Valley's part or if they had to cut back but the kids were not thrilled.<br />The product description did not specify the varieties I would be receiving but I did not mind as we generally have enjoyed all of Nature Valley's varieties we were just disappointed in the nearly non-existent chocolate chunks.,0
"as with any K cup, the setting needs to be medium or small cup to have a satisfactory taste.  this Hazlenut is better than most I've had",0
"Good quality and well sealed. I thought I was purchasing ground or granulated onion. This item stands for what it means ""powder"". There is a difference between powered onion and ground/granules. The texture of powder is like flour, very fine and can dry up the gravy in the meal. I made the mistake in confusing ground onion for poweder. I've learned that powdered onion does not work well for me. I'll check more careful next time. There is nothing wrong with this product, It's just not my preferece in texture.",0
"My pets love the chicken treats. But over the last 3 purchases, 1/3 of the bag ends up as powder, which sticks in my pets' throats. Working out to $35/lb -- that's some very expensive chicken. So I expect to be able to use more than only 2/3 of the product. Maybe I should try to make my own.",0
"This is a great product and it arrived very quickly and in great condition. However; if the total purchase price including shipping ends up being any more than $17 for the same amount of gum, then it is not a deal at all. It costs me about $17/$17.50 including tax if I purchase the same amount from Walgreen's - plus I don't have to wait for it to be shipped. Please note that the gum itself works very well at lessening tooth sensitivity and freshens breath with a great taste.",0
"I like gummi bears,but not theses. Some of them tasted awful! Some were hard!!!!!!!!! I wont buy them again.I would have thought they would have been softer. My grandchildren even had trouble chewing them. I will however buy the gummi peaches. Hopefully they wont be hard!",0
"I purchaed the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.",0
"I drink water and tea a lot. While visiting relatives all over this planet I've imbibed water everywhere. Sometimes unfiltered tap water, filtered tap water, reverse-osmosis tap water, well water and of course, BOTH still and sparkling bottled water to avoid stomach upset in under-developed parts of the world.<br /><br />All that being said, I cannot taste ANYTHING better or worse or feel physically better or worse after drinking this bottle of Essentia.  I'm having difficulty validating IF I'm receiving it's advertised benefits after drinking only ONE bottle. I suspect more are necessary.<br /><br />However, it's likeable because it has... no calories, no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, no BPA in the plastic bottle.  BUT it's made from local tap waters! I'd purchase this for my  emergency water stash; a necessity during tornado season when water availability is touch-n-go. Otherwise, I'll continue drinking the filtered tap water at home and filling my non-BPA stainless steel water bottles daily like I usually do.  It's unlikely this product will replace my homemade sports drink, but it's nice to know there's an alternative.",0
"The tree looks healthy, arrived quickly, etc., but came in a high rectangular green container instead of the low round white one in the picture. I picked this tree over similar ficuses because of the container...so this is disappointing. However, the tree looks good.",0
"I was really wondering how this would work.  I give them credit...they made mojito flavor!  The mint and citrus are well defined...and there's a little something else in there too.  I guess it's what gin might taste like if gin didn't have any bite at all.  It's also a bit sweeter than I would think of the normal version of this drink being, but then that's probably fitting with it being crystal light.<br /><br />But that said, unless you really like the flavor by itself, this struck me as a bit weird and not something I wanted to drink much of.  We made a whole jug of it and did finally get through it, but I think both the boyfriend and I are a little leary of making another one.<br /><br />Tried adding some vodka we had around...gin might work, but the vodka just sort of killed the flavor and made it taste like odd sweet vodka.<br /><br />I did try a little of it dry in a little hand whipped creme...that was actually quite enjoyable.  I may try finding other uses for it...not sure if I want to drink it all.<br /><br />I'm going to rate it as 3 stars mostly because in the end I didn't really care for it and I wouldn't buy it again.  I can't rate it lower however...it does capture the flavor better than expected and is identifiable as what it claims to be.",0
"The drink is nothing exemplary in my opinion. Its taste is tolerable but nothing that made me want to order more of the product. While it is 100% juice and contains 100% of one's recommended daily amount of vitamin C, I could not agree that it had a ""great taste and refreshment"" about it.<br /><br />The drink also left a little bitter aftertaste. However, this was not a big deal.<br /><br />The can was probably more negative to me than anything. I am not certain why is was necessary to use an aluminum can for 8.5 ounces. Of course, this is switchbev's choice. However, I think it a poor one for our environment.",0
"I have tried Black Tiger and Wake Up Call so I thought I would give Jet Fuel a try. It's definitely strong enough, but both Black Tiger and Wake up Call have more interesting flavors.  Jet Fuel is like a one note band and the others are like combos or symphonies. It's a great note, but honestly I am now 1/3 the way through the 50 pack and I<br />pretty much blend it with another k cup just for the kick. It's not a great stand alone coffee, for me. Lacks complexity is they way coffee geeks would say it. It's like a<br />really strong cup of diner coffee. Hot, bold, but lacking sophistication.  Black Tiger is probably the most interesting cup to me; Wake up Call comes in second. With so<br />many really good strong extra bold k cups out there (Emeril's, GM Sumatra, Van Houtte Eclipse, etc.) Jet Fuel is just average.  Just lacks the depth and flavors to make it<br />a top choice. I drink it black with 6 ounces of water for the brew.  I'll be reordering one of the others when I need more.",0
"After seeing these hyped up over and over again as the ""best"" ramyun noodles, I had to try them. Verdict after two boxes? They're OK.<br /><br />Every review on here is how flavorful and SPICY these are. Well, they do taste pretty good. Do they taste that much better than the 10 cent ramyun at the local grocery store? To my taste, they don't. I will concede they are slightly better and certainly more filling.<br /><br />As far as spicy.. I'm so confused on this. Every review says to use half a packet as these will burn your mouth off. So needless to say, I was expecting HEAT! These aren't spicy at all. To give you a frame of reference, I'm usually sweating after eating ""hot"" wings at Applebees. If you've ever gone to Buffalo Wild Wings, I have a difficult time eating the ""Asian Zing"" wings. I can't tolerate heat very well. However, I have a pretty mild burn going on in my mouth after eating a bowl with full spice, and it's not unpleasant enough to warrant a drink.<br /><br />So, all in all, not bad noodles. Don't think I'd ever pay $20 for them again, though.",0
"REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.<br />THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE.

I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.<br />HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN.",0
"I got a free sample of Apple Cinnamon Belvita from my gym a few months ago but had been avoiding it because I like my weekday breakfast to be less carb-heavy. Plus, the name of this product sounds suspiciously similar to a certain processed cheese substance (didn't anyone catch that in product testing?). At any rate, I was in a pinch this morning so I grabbed my Belvita and ran out the door.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me as I took a bite was the fake-o apple ""natural flavor"" this thing is infused with. It falls closer to Jolly Rancher than Jonathan on the apple spectrum. Additionally, it's a little sweet for my tastes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. I expected something too hard or overly grainy, but it actually is more reminiscent of a Biscoff cookie than anything else. And like Biscoff, it made a decent accompaniment to a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Because of the fake-o flavor, I didn't expect this to have any actual fruit in it, but little bits of dried apple kept getting stuck in my molars. Surprise. These are more of an annoyance than an asset, though, since I spent about 10 minutes trying to discreetly pick them out of my teeth with my tongue.<br /><br />Others seem to enjoy Belvita, but it's not really my thing. I have a sample of the blueberry-flavored one I'm going to try as well, but I can't see myself consistently purchasing it.",0
"Based on reviews, I expected something better. This tea does beat Lipton yellow bag, but it is not better than some of the better bagged teas. It is nowhere near as good as some other loose teas. It is OK, if you need your caffeine fix without offending your taste buds, but that's about it. If you can appreciate this analogy, it is like a very high quality cigarette: better than low quality cigarette, but not as good a a cigar or a pipe.",0
"Tasty but not superior to other drinks of this type that I have tried. I had expected something out of the ordinary but this wasn't it. Is is tasty, but not memorably so.",0
"I enjoy the NUGO bars in several other flavors, and was looking to expand on that.  I purchased these without realizing that they are gluten free, etc.  I can see that that was totally my mistake.  I didnt read the description fully.  That being said, these are quite awful.  The taste alone is not the problem, I think it is the texture that is horrible.  Gave a couple away, but will probably throw most of them away.  The shipping was very timely, and the description listed fully what I was purchasing, so I cant complain too much.  I have never purchased anything else gluten free, but based on this experience, I will stay far away from anything gluten free in the future  :-)  That should teach me to pay more attention to the description!!",0

"I have to admit I'm more than a little disappointed in this tea. I had high hopes after trying Bigelow's Raspberry flavored herbal and black teas. This one simply doesn't taste ""peachy"" enough. In fact, I would say that it has more of a peach ""aftertaste"" than a real peach taste. It's not the worst herbal tea I've had, but I've had better.",0
The flavor is good but this cookie is much too sweet for my taste.  It's  surprising for a French product since I find their pastries to be less  cloying or sugary than American desserts.  The best I can say of these is that they're crunchy...if that's what you're looking for.,0
"I've tried these before individually, but this was the first opportunity I had to get them together.  First, the food is relatively good quality for this kind of product, but I would say that it's more oily than what you'd find in a restaurant (and definitely moreso than homecooked) and of course significantly higher in sodium.  The taste, however, is reasonably good.  Second, the price that I paid for these was very good (I ended up getting a 20% discount), and so from a value perspective I would say decently good food + good price = very good value.",0
"Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.  But, now that I'VE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet.",0
"After opening package I was a little disappointed at how small it was. However, it was a great project to involve my grandson in as no oven was involved. It was very easy to prepare. Once taking my first few bites and tasting its richness, I realized there was plenty.",0
"These pretzels are OK for the gluten free diet but not a good substitute for ""real"" pretzels.",0
My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.,0
As always Joyva is the BEST! My ONLY reason for not giving this a higher rating is the bottom layer was stale.  The rest was incredibly delicious!,0
"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats...",0
"I started out with half of the can because the can is labeled as two servings.<br />After about 20 minutes I went back and finished the other half.<br /><br />This taste is not terrible. Its actually drinkable but it is very sweet (I never put sugar in my tea or coffee).<br />You can smell and taste the ""vitamins"". To me the smell is a little worse than the taste but overall not bad.<br /><br />As for the caffeine you can tell there is some. There was a slight energy boost.<br />No jittery feeling.

"I'm not a huge fan of the aftertaste that most sugar-free candies leave, but these ones are an exception. Same great flavor as the sugared candy, but without the calories. I put them in a candy dish and nobody knows the difference, but they're great because any guest can eat them whether they are diabetic or not.",0

"I ordered and received the Benecol caramels.  They are quite expensive but if they do what they are supposed to do then they are worth the cost. I have eaten them now for about 2 weeks.  They are quite tasty-not sweet like candy but certainly good.  But it is too soon to review this product completely until I see evidence from my bloodwork to know if it does what it is supposed to do-that is lower overall cholesterol and raise the good cholesterol.  I will review it again when I have a bloodtest taken in another month.  Certainly, if they do what they are supposed to do, I'd much rather take them than some prescription medicine that has side effects.",0
I bought both baja bobs and go cocktails.. i think baja bobs is better by a lot.  They are both good though.  Maybe im too used to splenda?  i was surpirsed when reading all these positive reviews because i wasnt blown away.,0
the coffee wasn't anything special and on the label it says the processing is done in new jersey.  not worth the money at all.,0
"Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.",0
"First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really ""everlasting"" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y"">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting.",0
"First one I had was OK. The second and third tasted better as I had become accustomed to it. My husband liked it too and said he felt a bit refreshed/increased energy after drinking it. But too pricey for what you get. There are less expensive ways to eat/drink healthfully, I think.",0
"I love Lavazza products.  Crema e Gusto is by far my favorite espresso.  This coffee is okay.  No robust flavor or aroma.  I like my coffee to have a deep rich flavor and this lacks both.

"This product as sold as ""original"" but it is modern fruity bubble gum flavored, *not* the ""original"" Dubble Bubble gum flavor from 1928 which was a mixture of cinnamon and wintergreen.  That flavor was stopped when the manufacturer, Fleer, was sold to Tootsie Roll.  Someone still makes small batches of the original flavor -- but this product is just ordinary modern Dubble Bubble, the same as sold in stores throughout North America.  Amazon and/or the seller were kind enough to refund my purchase price but they continue to sell this product with the misleading label.",0
"I do like Yogi teas, and have tried several kinds over the years.<br /><br />I prepared this tea as per their instructions, letting the tea steep for 4-6 minutes.  I actually let my tea steep even longer then that.  It looked dark enough in the cup, but I found the tea too weak to only use one tea bag for an 8 ounce cup, which is what I used, and what they said to use.<br /><br />To me, it tasted like very weak chai tea, which I do enjoy chai tea.  The vanilla flavor was very faint, at least to me.  I was hoping for a stronger vanilla flavor to this tea.<br /><br />It didn't do anything for me energy wise.  Next time I use this tea, I will be using two tea bags instead of one.  It wasn't bitter to me, so I just drank it straight, using no sweetener, which I normally use honey, but that is more for if Iam drinking tea because I have a sore throat, or if the tea is bitter, which was not the case this time.<br /><br />Some medicinal teas do a very good job at helping with whatever ailment you have, but to me this tea will just be enjoyed as another cup of tea, without thinking it will actually go anything specific, like giving me added energy.<br /><br />What's funny, they compare this tea to having almost as much caffeince as a cup of coffee,80 mg for an 8 ounce cup of this tea, versus 90 mg for an 8 ounce cup of coffee, but to me, even tho I don't like my coffee very strong, one cup of coffee I would feel a difference, it would perk me up sooner, but with this tea I didn't notice any change at all.<br /><br />I agree, this tea does not make you jittery, because it really doesn't have any effect of that kind at all, at least not on me!",0
"I'm not a margarita drinker, so I can't compare this product to the ""real thing."" The taste was OK, actually too sweet for me, though I like it better mixed with half again more water than recommended.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest drawback of the product for me: each pack makes 2 quarts, and I just don't want two quarts of it at a time, much less three quarts. I tried tipping just a bit of the powder into a glass of water but found it impossible to get a consistent strength. I could have measured with a teaspoon, I suppose, but it was just a lot of trouble for a taste that was OK but really not more enjoyable than a glass of water from the cooler at the office.<br /><br />Just not my thing, I guess, though I'd enjoy a glass once in a while. It may come in smaller packets, in which case I might be interested.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2012",0
"This coffee has excellent flavor. The only trouble with these cups: the plastic on the cups is thicker than other brands. You must press firmly when placing them in the machine to make sure the bottom of the cup is punctured, before closing. If you do not, you will have a mess. The machine backs up with grounds and spits out grounds and little water. I tried another brand just to make sure my machine wasn't broke. The other brand, I placed in the maker and closed the lid. I did not press to seat it on the bottom needle. It worked perfectly by just closing the machine. I tried the Tully's and it ran everywhere if not pressed down firmly on the cup before brewing. Just a word of caution, but good tasting coffee.",0

"I got this gift box of Nami flowering tea leaves for Christmas.  Sat down to my first cup this morning.  No labels on the ""flowers"" so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea.  After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it.  I had to pour it down the sink.  I give 3 stars for a great bamboo box,but so far the tea is not drinkable.  Also without labels you don't know if you pour hot water on delicate green tea leaves or boiling water on the black leaves.  I wouldn't buy it again.",0
"Even in the stores, they tend to be broken, but these on average are worse. Given the price per cracker, that makes them really expensive.<br /><br />Love the crackers themselves. They are the best vehicle for peanut butter and jam that I've found.",0
"If you are here - you probably already know if you want this product or not, so here is a basic review for your reading pleasure.  Shake `n Bake is an old school classic.  It is crunchy and tasty, but not full of pizzazz - it is a bit bland, but sticks around in the same nostalgic way that Twinkies, Hamburger Helper, Ketchup, and Jell-o do ... these products will never die, but I highly doubt they will ever again enjoy the glory days they once had.  The very best part about shake `n bake is that it serves as Ricky Bobby's (ever fun to say) slogan ... SHAKE `N BAKE!!!!  That's right!  That JUST happened!!!!",0
"When agave first came on the scene I thought it sounded great.  But after a lot more research I don't think it's the wonder sweetener that many people think it is.  It is VERY high in (processed) fructose, not the same as fructose found in natural fruit.  Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.  My favorite is a 2 oz. bottle of NuNaturals No Alcohol Liquid Stevia--it mixes instantly in beverages, is not bitter, and lasts forever.",0
"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",0
"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness.",0
"I had never realized how popular Dunkin' Donuts coffee was until I saw all these ""donut"" k-cup coffee clones.  I've tried Dunkin Donuts, Donut Shoppe and Donut House varieties.  The Donut House flavor is the mildest/smoothest of the 3 with a muted bitter aftertaste and, of the 3, I like it the least.  The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a ""cinnamon roll"" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.  It did make for a stronger coffee taste but the flavor tasted the same, maybe slightly more bitter.<br /><br />It's not a bad coffee, and I kinda like the milder flavor for evening drinking but if I get it again, I'll stick with the Donut House plain flavor.",0
"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.",0
"Seems to me there was a different version of this cereal around some years ago that rather resembled Life. Be that as it may, this cereal in no way resembles Life and requires a bit of a commitment. It's very hearty, holds up superbly in milk, and is only kind of sweet. In short, a bowlful can't be scarfed down like frosted flakes or fruit rings; it demands your attention for the duration. This is good, because one should pay attention to what one eats. It would be nice if there was a little more flavor to devote one's attention to though. There is some, both of oats and cinnamon, but they're rather overwhelmed by the sheer bulk of the pieces. All in all, I'd give them average marks on their own and recommend them as a mixer with other cereals that have a lighter and perhaps sweeter character.",0
"These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.",0

"This product does taste really good to me compared with something like muscle milk that is not as sweet.  But there is a good reason, this has 27 grams of sugar vs. the 5 grams in the same size muscle milk.  This amounts to more empty carbs and hardly any healthy fats.  So even though the protein content is nice with 20 grams, the relatively high calories, lack of healthy fat, and overuse of sugar make me only give this a 3 out of 5 for overall health and usefulness in accomplishing your goals.  I also take a soy based shake which has about 15 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein that tastes nearly as good, so for me I am going to stick with muscle milk and my soy shakes for now despite the slightly better flavor.",0
"As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon ""bags"" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)",0
"These appear to be pretty healthy online but after the taste test I am probably going to stop the auto-ship function as they are too sweet, especially for a ""healthy"" snack.

"I wasn't sure what to expect with this product. I can't disagree with the name. It is mostly water with just a hint of a coconut flavor. It is not sweet like a juice. It is not like coconut milk.<br />What was surprizing, is the amount of carbohrdrates (according to the package label). Not as much as a sugar sweetened soft drink or a juice, but much higher than water or a diet beverage.",0
"My cats love these so much that one of them stole an entire bag off the kitchen counter, tore out the bottom, and ate most of it while I was away one morning. That said, I'm not terribly happy with these treats. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th main ingredients in the treats are ground corn, rice, and wheat flour -- starches I'm not stoked about giving my cats. The ingredient list is also very long. These were the best I could find at my local grocery store, and the cats definitely like them, but I'm hoping to find better ones through Amazon. I'm looking for a poultry-based treat with few additives; I picked these out because, despite the 'real salmon and garden greens flavor,' the ingredient list begins with chicken by-product meal; for reference, salmon meal is the 17th ingredient and the first green comes much later.",0

"I enjoy a variety of nuts for snacks and cooking. This is definitely more the snack-variety.  I liked that the nuts tasted very fresh and had a pleasant aroma when I opened the canister. The canister itself is very convenient and wide enough to reach into for the snack without scraping your knuckles on a rough plastic rim.  The pepper flavor is significant, but not overpowering. A good balance.  However, I like salty snacks, but found this to be a little too salty, even at the risk of drowning out the flavor of the cashew.  If you like VERY salty, these are good, but if you like mildly salty, steer clear.  I can't even imagine how the ones on the bottom of the canister would taste.",0
"Just received my 3 pack of the San Fransisco Bay one cup for k-cup. It was delivered as promised, arrived a little crushed, but with no damage to product. I prefer a strong brew of coffee, so it tasted a bit weak for my preference. I really didn't think there was anything special about the small bit of flavor it did have. I will try it again with a smaller brew setting... Keep in mind I love espresso so I'm a hard core coffee drinker.<br />I loved the non-plastic design, and it actually fit in my Cuisinart k-cup brewer even better than the regular k-cup! I think the design is the biggest plus because it also makes the price more reasonable. I might try this brand again, but will definitely see if they have a bolder brew.",0
"Yes, it has the ""fake sugar"" taste, but it's okay.  The real downside to the product is the price.  In a coffee K-Cup, there is more to it than just coffee grounds in the K-Cup...there is a filter etc, and the brewing occurs in the cup.  With these cider K-cups, it's just ordinary drink mix in the K-Cup.  You're better off just buying the powder at the grocery store, and run the Keurig just for hot water, as you would for tea.",0
"The directions say to use 2 Tablespoons for every 6 oz cup.  If you do that, you will gag; this can't be drank at that strength (at least, not until you get used to it and if you really like it).  Two Tablespoons is actually a good starting point for an entire 12 cup pot!<br />The flavor does not really resemble coffee much.  However, if you are just looking for a black beverage that is hot, to drink when you are cold during the winter, this would fit the bill.  The flavor is not off-putting, provided you allow it to stand on it's own merit without comparing it with coffee.<br />Just remember, no more than 2 Tablespoons of grounds per POT to start with.",0
Was wanting dehydrated/dried mushrooms in thoughts of putting them in my Japanese clear soup...but even after simmering for an hour and waiting until the next day to eat the soup the mushrooms were still far to chewy and hard for my liking.

As of right now though Im not that impressed and wont likely purchase these again.,0
"UPDATE:  This conditioner leaves a non-dissolving thick, slimy residue in my shower drain.  I have not noticed that any of my other conditioners did the same thing.  I do not know if this enough residue to cause a drain build-up & future plumbing issues.<br /><br />I have medium to fine shoulder length, non-treated, layered hair & found the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner to be on par with my other conditioner (Suave Professionals).<br /><br />This conditioner goes on thick & takes a little work to rinse out (Suave does too).  It leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny & bouncy all day long.  I did not notice a significant difference in ""no tangle"" or hair loss from Clear versus my other daily conditioner, so I cannot comment on Clear's ""strong lengths"" claim.  In the end, my decision to continue to use Clear will be based upon price point since the results seem to be similar to other products that I have used in the past.<br /><br />Note: I like the bottle design (dispenser on the bottom) & have not experienced seepage.",0
The clams were ok. I also had some canned oysters around and they were much better. The clams seemed a little tough.,0
"This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.<br /><br />The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.<br /><br />This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.<br /><br />Yet that my be all you want. A potent heat source and this one certainly meets that mark!<br /><br />If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.<br /><br />I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then give it 3 or 4 stars or even 5 stars.<br /><br />If you want even more heat then look for a Habanero sauce that does not list water as its first (therefore major) ingredient. There are other Habanero sauces which are even hotter but I'll confess I'm not a big fan of tasteless but ultra hot chile sauces.<br /><br />Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one. In all fairness I gave it three stars because it offered pure heat without any obvious flaws.",0
"Well, I was hoping that the poultry seasoning I got would be of a newer vintage, but the code shows mine was packed in August, 2001. However, it still smells pretty potent. I'm going to actually cook with it before I send it back. Price wise, Walmart wanted $3.78  for .065 ounces...so this is a steal. I'm going to rate it middling till I actually use it. Then I'll rerate it based on flavor, not just dates.<br />On the cooking side of things, poultry seasoning is my secret ingredient in nearly all of my soups. Potato soup, cream of broccoli, chicken...all benefit greatly from 1/2- 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.",0

Unfortunately its hard to estimate size with these toys but I went by a ladies comment on how her labs loved it.  Thinking that labs made this toy last I thought my two pit mixes would do the same.

"I've been a fan of Jack Links beef jerky for a long time.  This product, however, sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.  That is, this isn't a hard sausage.  It's like highly processed meat (including pork hearts!).  Under the red skin, they're really mushy, almost like pât&eacute; or a soft hot dog.  An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Your mileage may vary.",0
"Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!",0
"These are quite tasty if you like sugar or sweets (I do), but they contain partially hydrogenated oil. For taste alone, I would give these 5 stars for people who like sweets. For people who want a healthy snack, I wouldn't recommend these. Overall I am giving it 3 stars because while these may taste good, it's only due to being very sweet due to lots of sugar and corn syrup. Also, while the impression may be that these are good for you being only 90 calories (it's only a .8 ounce bar anyway), I certainly wouldn't say they are. They also contain artificial flavors.",0
I have had other Annie's fruit snacks and they are wonderful! But for some reason this mix is nasty. Very weird taste at first. Then gets a little bit better. My 4-year-old and her little friends ate them fine but I don't see why. Maybe it was a bad batch or something. Glad I got a good deal on them...would have been irritated if I would have paid a lot. But I do like that these are SO much better for you than others. As far as they consistency...they were just really gummy (I have never had that happen with other Annie's fruit snacks).,0
"Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.",0

A flavoring made of coffee mixed with chocolate.<br /><br />  2.)  From the food dictionary available at epicurious dot com:  [...]<br />  1. Originally the word ""mocha"" referred only to a very fine coffee grown in Arabia and shipped from Yemen's port of Mocha. Today, this strong, slightly bitter coffee is still available but not as popular as it was in the 16th and 17th centuries. 2. A hot coffee-and-chocolate beverage.<br /><br />So it is no wonder people will get confused -- and that's simply not good marketing.  Although Amazon's description of this coffee now has ""This is not a flavored coffee,"" I feel that is not specific enough--I would suggest adding the word ""chocolate"" before ""flavored.""  Although on the GMCR dot com website the product is categorized as a ""regular coffee"" and not a ""flavored coffee,"" my modest UCLA Anderson MBA marketing background suggests that Timothy's Coffee company include in its description of this product words to the effect that:<br /><br />  ""Mocha Java got its name because long ago in Al-Makha, a historic Yemeni seaport, Javanese coffee was combined, by mistake, with coffee from a more local, Northeast African origin, producing a unique blend which quickly became very popular in the 16th & 17th centuries.  Hence, the ""mocha"" derived from ""Al-Makha"" and the ""java"" derived from ""Javanese.""  While Timothy's Mocha Java is not a chocolate-flavored coffee as the modern name ""mocha"" may imply, it is a richly blended regular coffee steeped in Old World tradition, with the bright sweetness of Ethiopian beans and the hearty body of Indonesian beans.""<br /><br />Just my two cents.  As a ""regular coffee,"" it's slightly bitter and would be difficult to drink ""black"" in my opinion, but with some non-dairy creamer added (along with the requisite included corn syrup sweetener additive), it's fine.",0
"I didn't love this chocolate.  I bought it to try as an alternative to Endangered Species 88% Extreme Dark because it contains a teeny bit of soy and I'm trying to avoid all soy.  Compared to the latter, you can definitely taste the cocoa powder in this bar... tastes like hot cocoa in the back of my throat; not a bad thing necessarily just not a true and rich/ bitter dark chocolate.  Probably more pleasing to the American palate, but I think I'll risk the 2% soy for the delicious taste of Endangered Species and cross my fingers that they'll eventually find an equally delicious formula sans soy!",0
"The first time I drank this tea I almost gagged. I'd prepared it according to the directions but it was too spicy. I then had the good sense to add more water and a chamomile tea sachet to break down the spicyness...and it was wonderful. I then discovered that eating the ginger crystals by themselves was quite pleasant as well. I know it sounds weird, but the crystals are tasty, probably because they're so sweet...which leads me to my next point. Although sugar TASTES good, im not a fan of consuming too much of it. It's 17 grams per packet, which I think is too high for a cup of tea. It makes my teeth feel all gritty afterwards (no bueno). If they made a sugar free version I'd be sold :)",0
"After finding the right way to brew this coffee - as strong as I like it - , I realized that there was nothing extraordinary about the flavor.  It's not completely bland, it just doesn't have anything special that would make me want to buy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Organic<br />- Part of the money goes to a good cause<br />Cons:<br />- Nothing special in the type of roast.<br />- Too high price.<br /><br />I'd rather stick to other brands that I like better than buy Marley coffee.",0
I love the taste and consistency of this bar. And the added calcium is a plus. But I try not to eat it too often because it has 12 grams of fat and the saturated fat is 25% of daily value. And 2g of protein is a bummer.,0
"I've been eating super bubble gum from the time i could ask my grandfather for a nickle. I could buy ten for that nickle.I'm 55 now. I don't eat any other bubble gum but super bubble gum. I can go through a bucket of original 360ct in about two weeks with no problems. As a child i would chew,chew and chew until all the flavor was gone. Mary jane was the next one. If you saw or knew me as a little one and if i had money, you knew i has super bubble gum, mary jane. Super Bubble Gum in my right pocket mary jane in the left.. The maker have change hand so what, the size has change, the price has done some change and not to mention the flavor. Maybe the new maker no how to put the flavor back.In my day it lasted a long time that's why they called it SUPER BUBBLE GUM.",0
"These smell great, but my first impression of the taste was of plastic. If you're desperate for a snack and you keep chewing on them, they kind of get better with time, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to purchase them.",0

"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",0
I am not a big fan of this candy. It is basically a little round gummy with chili on the outside. The only thing I like about this candy is the the chili on the outside but I don't like the rest. I hate biting on the gummy part because it sticks strongly to your teeth.,0
"The package arrived fine. However, this is quite expensive for what it is. It's much cheaper to buy in the store.",0
"...  for those of us counting Weight Watcher points, it's a find.  I've been using it on sandwiches and in coleslaw instead of mayonnaise and adding a dab of real Dijon to kick up the flavor.  Zero calories, zero fat, zero carbs?  I'm in.<br /><br />As for amazon sending expired food items, that's inexcusable but not Grey Poupon's fault.",0
"I have purchased this coffee multiple times because I REALLY love the flavor.  I am almost to the point of not buying it again, however, because I keep having trouble with the seals on top of the k-cups coming open during brewing.  This wastes a lot of coffee because grounds get all in the cup I am brewing.  Not mo mention, coffee goes EVERYWHERE!  The water goes out the top of the k-cup and shoots out every which way!  It's VERY frustrating!",0
"I was swayed to purchase this coffee due to the high ratings. My observation was that this coffee had a terrific scent, not only successful in making me downright hungry when I brewed it, but fetching many positive comments from people at work. If I didn't know any better, I'd have assumed I was brewing hot chocolate. When it was all said and done, however, I thought the overall taste was just OK. Not at all bad - after all, I only drink black coffee, but perhaps my tastebuds are just defective and I require more than a medium bodied flavor. On another note, I think it lent itself well on those weekend mornings when I felt like pouring in a splash of Jameson.",0
"I bought one of these today from my local grocery story. The taste on these is not bad, its just non-existent. I don't know how others can post that it tastes just like real chocolate...I suspect they might be paid review writers. I've tried other protein bars that taste sweet and more like real chocolate for example ""Oh Yeah"" bars (but those have more sugar).<br /><br />If you value a good tasting protein bar stay away from this one. I do like the fact that it has 0 sugar, perhaps this is why it tastes like nothing. I will give it three stars just because it has no sugar and these bars do not taste bad (taste like nothing).",0
"I'm not sure I got the right product; it didn't look like the picture. I expected that the tea bags would be in an air tight bag, but in fact I got a big box of paper wrapped tea bags, and the box was just shrink wrapped, so when I opened it there was no protection at all from the air. The picture of the product makes it look like it's in an air tight bag. Anyway. The tea itself is tasty, but doesn't have the zip I expected from the only other time I had tried coca tea, and that was from a ten year old teabag a friend had brought back from Peru.",0
"I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM"">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.",0
"I was disappointed in this kit.  It says the seed pods and plastic holders will work with my Aero Garden but they are in fact too short to reach the water.  I ended up removing the seed pods and putting them in the old, longer plastic holders and that worked.  After I purchased this kit I bought the Master Gardeners deluxe kit which does not contain seeds.  Just plastic holders, growing ""sponges"", and nutrient tabs.  A much better choice as the parts actually work with my unit though I later found it would have been cheaper to buy it through the Aero Garden website (I purchased the Master Gardeners Deluxe kit directly from Amazon).",0
"I'm a big fan of Arnold Palmer by Arizona.....the best comes in the gallon bottles.  The cans have a slight metallic taste.<br /><br />This is the third best.  The artificial sweetener is probably better than all the sugar (or worse, HFCS), but overall the product is not as tasty.<br /><br />But, it's better than plain water.<br /><br />Also, there is enough in each packet to make 20 oz, perhaps more to your taste.  If you are adding it to a smaller bottle of water, don't use all the powder in the packet.",0
"It's tasty (we used it to make kimchi), but it is not at all spicy.  Very disappointing from that aspect.  We made a small batch of kimchi (4 quarts) and used two cups of these hot pepper flakes.  It's only barely spicier than paprika.  :(  If cayenne pepper is a 10, then this is a 2-3.  I don't think that ""Hot Pepper Coarse Type Powder"" is a good descriptor.  Maybe replace the word ""Hot"" with the word ""Red"".  It's definitely red, but it is certainly NOT hot.",0

"I am not a huge fan of canned coffee drinks, but I am always looking for easy coffee. This drink tasted just okay. It had a weird aftertaste that I can't quite describe. The size of the can is adequate. I definitely will not be purchasing this again in the future. If you like convenient, ok tasting coffee to go, this is it.",0
"I have used this supplement about 10 times so far, and it does have some effect on my workouts. The large size bottle though, is two servings. So taking an entire bottle puts a lot of junk into you at one time. I am afraid of drinking an entire bottle, and it needs to be refrigerated after opening, so I usually end up throwing away half a bottle. I recommend buying the smaller bottles instead",0
"This item is delicious, but was quite overpriced.  I didn't realize this price was for only one box.  I will not buy this again through this site,  It is cheaper in the supermarket.  I thought I could get it in bulk for cheaper.",0
I'm still trying to find the best way to use this product.  I have tried to grind the nibs into powder but it still doesn't dissolve.  I need help.,0
"I could not find mixing directions, so I mixed it with about 8 ounces of bottled water. The resulting drink tasted very medicinal, sort of like a medicated cough-drop. It wasn't awful, just not pleasant and certainly there wasn't a strong presence of pomegranate. The acai must be responsible for much of this, but the other suppliments may have played a role. I didn't notice anything perticularly boosted after taking it (I usually have a cafeinated soda or cup of tea), so it wasn't worth going through.<br /><br />I would have given it fewer stars, but I just had one packet with which to evaluate this and I presume those buying it are doing so for perceived benefits of the ingredients and not for the taste.",0
"This is not pie crust. It is soft graham cracker powder in an aluminum pie pan. When the pan cover is removed the soft graham cracker powder falls apart when placing filling in the pan and then trying to remove a portion. I scoop out the powder and place it in a bowl then add some filling and mix it up and serve portions on to a plate. Tastes ok this way. This graham cracker pie crust is NOT firm, hard or sweet like the ones you get in the grocery store. It is a cheap knockoff. Dont buy.",0
"Stevia as a nutural product, and is supposed to be easy for your body to digest. If you overdo it it begins to taste like an artificial sweetner. A little goes a long way.",0
"I like the companion shampoo to this product. It does the job with a minimal fragrance that doesn't linger. I expected the same of this product. Boy, was I surprised! This has a VERY strong, perfume-y smell that I just can't get past...COMPLETELY different than the shampoo. As with the shampoo, it does it's job just fine: detangling and conditioning, and my hair does feel quite silky (as much a very short bob can) after it's dry. That part I like. It rinses well, so hair doesn't feel gummy or sticky. The product appears to have a silicone derrivative in in, so if you're trying to avoid that (ie: fine hair or volume style, this product may not be for you. If you are fragrance sensitive or just don't like to be your olfactory nerve to be overpowered, stay away!",0
"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.",0
"It's okay, but it's not what I expected. It doesn't seems like a taro latte because of the color. It has bluish color not like purple. Taste is different, too. Overall, it is okay though.",0

"My dog loves bully sticks, so I decided to try this brand. He loved this one as well, however, he's an inside dog and the smell from these bully sticks is awfully strong and pungent. I don't want to let him chew on it outside, as the stick will definitely get dirty after he's chewed on it for awhile. In fairness, I'll let him finish this pack of sticks and see if I can adjust to the smell. Other than that, he seems to love this product as well and you can't beat the price. I've paid $7.49 for just one from Petco, but it was a different brand and didn't stink.<br />If you can get past the smell, then I'd recommend this product.",0
"Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.",0
"If you can eat an entire one of these little packages in a half a day, you won't have to worry about staleness. However, I would just recommend getting the regular size with less individual packaging and using a reusable zip bag or other container to keep the rest from getting stale. The graham crackers themselves were the usual good but not outstanding Honey Maid fare.",0
"I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!",0
"We bought this to use as hummingbird sugar color.  It might be great in Christmas cookies, but not for hummingbird food.  It stained everything, and was very difficult to remove the stain.  So, our fault for using it the wrong way.",0
"This is a great coffee if you like the taste of a dark robust brew. I like it myself, but my wife says it's a touch on the strong side. I've cut back on the amount of coffee I use for our brew cycle. The taste is satisfying and is not bitter at all.  If you like a dark Colombian, give it a try.",0
Almost every can I received was dented but I guess it's to be expected at this great price.<br /><br />The taste was okay but I have to say I'll never buy this again for the simple fact that the soybean oil spilled all over my can opener and counter top EVERY SINGLE TIME I opened a new can. Probably didn't help that they were all dented but still it was a mess no matter how careful I was.,0
"I was really looking forward to getting and using this honey.  The UPS package arrived today and was oozing honey out onto my porch. Half of the content of the jar was all over the inside of the box. The lid was loose on the jar & came off without breaking the security seal.  The jar is plastic with a plastic lid and maybe due to the hot weather we've had here the past few days but it did not fare well in transit. I'm going to try ordering this honey from another maker, hopefully in a glass jar with a quality lid.",0
"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",0

She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!",0
"OK, so the machine itself when we first got it was good. Then i washed it and saved it for baby number two and all went downhill. It was not even over a year before I used it again. The steam didn't steam properly and the blade got dull fast. I called customer service and got condescending answers and telling me i needed to re purchase all of the items. Then they said it should be better. I told if it doesn't will you give me my money back or may i return the items and she said no. I needed to redo it many more times and I am not doing it right. I don't get how many ways you can push a friggin switch but regardless I am going not recommending this or will I buy another one ever again.",0

"When it arrived, the glass container was broken. I had to get the coconut oil in another container.

"As the parent of a 4 year old little boy who is casein intolerant, I wanted to pack him something in his lunch for school that wasn't juice.  Since we have to limit his dairy intake, we are always concerned about making sure he gets enough calcium.  I bought these to pack in his school lunches thinking this would give him another serving of calcium.  Unfortunately I was mistaken, as there is no calcium in this product.  There are many other almond milk brands that are fortified with calcium (Almond Breeze and Silk's almond milk to name two) but at least for now they don't make 8oz sizes.  My son does love the taste, which is why I didn't give it 1 star.",0
"I've bought the smaller package of the same cat food at the store before. It was kind of expensive but I wanted to keep buying organic food for my beloved kitty. And I found this deal on Amazon. I was going to keep buying some kind of organic cat food anyways and I didn't have to drive store to store to find the organic cat food that I can buy locally. So it was the perfect solution for me!<br /><br />I wrote this about 3 months ago. Now my cat won't eat much just with the dry cat food by itself. That started over a month ago. I thought he got sick so I took him to a vet. She said, she doesn't see any problems. Now I read all the reviews and it all makes sense. He just don't like this cat food. He still asks for more food after I feed this food. So I needed to buy organic wet canned food to mix so that he'll eat something at least. I mean I want something really healthy for my kitty to live longer, but it concerns me if he doesn't eat because of food... But I don't wanna go back to the junky cat food with lots of bad stuff that he loves... I don't know what to do!",0
"For anyone who wants a low carb snack these are a good solution if you are a cheese lover. These little cubes are literally blocks of cheese with the moisture removed. That means they're high in protein and high in fat and, even though these are the ""lower sodium"" version, also still very high in sodium. One package at only 1.7oz delivers a whopping 800mg of sodium. I really like these but they have a lot going against them. They're VERY expensive. 1.7 oz is almost nothing. They are very high in fat and the sodium is about twice what it should be. That being said, I would still recommend these as an occasional low carb snack if you're not hypertensive.",0

I often find that the almond butter is already mixed however not evenly, leaving the almond butter dry after thoroughly mixing with the unmixed contents in the bottom of the jar.

I hope my future purchases will turn out as good as the first.",0
"My husband and I regularly eat crispy brown rice cereal.  Usually the stuff we buy has some kind of preservatives in it.  So when we found this we were excited and bought it on subscribe and save.  Unfortunately, it does not seem as crispy as the others.  Not sure if we are used to the preservative taste, but it was a bit disappointing.  I admit, I can't blame the cereal if that's the way its supposed to taste without preservatives.... but it also could be because Amazon sent us some old boxes.",0
"As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say ""Product of USA."" This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2.

"I had been salivating over these ""steak"" flavored kettle cooked potato chips for a long, long time. I just couldn't see myself paying so much for them...well, finally they were on special, so I bought a case of them. They are good--don't get me wrong--but they don't live up to the description on the package. It's cool that they list the actual variety of potato and where it was grown on the bag--that, I truly dig (no pun intended.) But they don't actually taste of flamegrilled angus steak. They aren't overly salty, and they are good, but nothing special and that's what disappoints me. Know what really gets me? We went to a discount chain last week and bought a big bag of Heinz Ketchup chips and paid two bucks for them--and they are delish! Who woulda thunk it? I did not expect to like them, but the kids wanted them. Now, if you want crunchy, fresh chips, go with these Mackies of Scotland brand chips--they have other flavors and I think maybe they might have been better than the beef ones. I just don't taste beef with these chips here. More like slightly smoky, slightly salty, very crunchy. Not bad, but not worth the extra money, at least for this variety, in my opinion.",0

"First, I have to confess that I expected this Kona blend to knock my socks off.  It didn't do that, or even come close to it, but it is a perfectly adequate coffee even if it is not what I would call a great coffee.  It is very mild, not bitter, and can be made in various strengths according to individual preference with no bitter after-taste.  I don't feel that I wasted my money but I am not sure I shall buy Jeremiah's Kona Blend again.",0
"I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.",0
"These are the oat chocolate chip coconut bars. These are a soft, cookie-like bar that is wheat and gluten free and have no dairy in them. They also have Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grains, and no trans fats.<br /><br />The bars taste pretty good, although I couldn't really taste the coconut in them. They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.<br /><br />On the downside, the bars are really crumbly, almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that, I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories. And finally, for five bars, the regular price on Amazon is listed as $30 but they are now discounted to $24.<br /><br />Although they might taste good, I will not be buying these. That is way too much money for three or four bites of a very crumbly cookie.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.",0
"Very hard to find in stores in USA. Used to be sold in Occitane stores all over, that is finished. Very few fancy food stores carry this oil (Citarella in NYC for expl).

Unfortunately on the web the distributors send this expensive product in several boxes, each time the price of shipping double price. In NYC you find the product at Citarella for about $14. If you use the web the price is more than 100% with shipping. The product is superb, but I think the exclusif distribution take advantage of their position, I advise you not to buy on the web. Too expensive!",0
"After reading the other reviews, I was thinking I'd better be careful lest I end up beet red and running around my office like a rat on acid.  Well no problems there.  I tried just half a bottle and felt no different.  Tried a whole bottle and kept waiting for the ""afterburner"" to kick in.  Well, personally I think strong coffee works best for me.",0
"Important disclaimer: I like to snack on cereal without milk. Dry cereal is one of my favorite snacks, and I thought this one would be great for that purpose. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It can best be described as Corn Flakes meets Honey Nut Cheerios, which sounds great in theory, but it just didn't do it for me. It's a bit too sweet, a little on the bitter side, and they really should've used almonds instead of peanuts.",0
"I was really looking for a moist treat for training my lab puppy.  However, these tend to harden up quickly.  My lab loves the taste but it takes him about 30 seconds to eat one, even when I break it in half.",0
Good strong coffee.  The problem is with the kcups themselves.  In my keurig these are the only cups I've ever had a problem with.  After making my second cup of the morning there were coffee grinds in my coffee cup. Happened a couple of times.  No other brand has done that...might have been a bad batch in my box.  Nevertheless 3 stars for you.,0
"If I ever had a choice of bottled 'plain water' I suspect Essentia's would be the number one or close to that. Essentia's is simply 'good water'. It tastes good, the way good water is expected to taste with no aftertaste, it has no odors and it's crystal clear. This being said, I can't see myself paying more for 'water' than I would for the same amount of premium gasoline for as long as I can get 'almost as good' out of my well for 99% less even when I factor in the cost of the filters.<br /><br />Price aside, consider me impressed. Besides purified water, the ingredients list includes: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride. And, of course, it's got electrolytes.",0
"I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much.",0
"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",0
"My cats go nuts for this but it's way to expensive.  Also, I have purchased 10-20 bags at one time and alot of the bags contained mostly crushed, powdery ingredients in the bags.  I don't know why this is but I'm not going to spend all that money for powder instead of pieces of the treats.  It's a shame because it's an excellent product but who can afford it!",0
The quality of this brand was very very good. I really enjoyed three of the six but the other three were bland. The three I liked were a little less spicy then I would eat but made for the masses.... I bought a 6 pack the the Kidney Bean Curry and spice it up to my liking and it's great.,0
"Upon receiving a package of 12 bars, I noticed on the back of the one of the individual wrappers ""Allergy Information:  Manufactured on shared equipment with products containing milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, and other nuts.""  Nowhere on Amazon nor Theo's website is this found (at least in the 15-20 minutes I spent looking).<br /><br />I have not tried the chocolate because I have Celiac disease so I cannot comment on the quality of the product.  I just wanted to save people some time.",0
"I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0
"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags.",0
"I usually get mine from Target when there is a sale - $21, plus using my $5 off Similac coupon, comes to $0.75 per ounce vs. $0.92 from Amazon. I am a frequent Amazon shopper, but this deal is just not as good as I get from Target.",0
These are the best protein bars that I've ever eaten.  It's a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free.  LOVE THEM.  I've purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product.  The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma's freezer for too long.  Further the taste and texture were also a bit off.  My 4 and 5 year old boys love these.  They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased.,0
"I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice-cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.  My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.",0
"Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar.<br /><br />I do love the black cherry flavor best!",0
"After almost three years of avoiding any type of hamburger bun due to celiac disease, I was really thrilled to be able to eat a real hamburger on a bun!  I wrapped it in a moist paper towel and nuked it for 15 seconds and it softened up enough to compare favorably with a normal hamburger bun.  The fact that they can be stored without refrigeration until opened for a long period of time is a big plus!  I have not tried toasting one yet as I would have to use the family toaster-oven to do it and do not want to take a chance on contamination with real bread crumbs, etc.  I would recommend this product to any one.",0
"The taste is OK and the noodle was not oil fried. It was once $44.45, so the price is OK. But now it is $51.05. For such a small pack, I need to pay $1.25 each. I just feel it is too expensive.",0
"This food is definitely a step above grocery store brands but my dog could not tolerate the grain and had loose stools for 2 months which she also had on royal canin, switched to Orijen puppy food and all Is well",0
"People with celiac disease looking for a tasty cookie that smells like spice cake should definitely try a box of these. For the rest of us, though, they are nothing particularly special... with nutrition only slightly better than a Twinkie and without the staying power of a Clif bar, it is probably best to consider Pamela's Whenever Bars a specialized snack.",0
"The drink mix comes in a foil packet that is not easy to open. You'll need scissors.<br /><br />According to the instructions, you need to add hot water, so it is easy to prepare.<br /><br />I was surprised at how spicy the drink was. It's similar to chai tea, though you can also taste the honey and lemon flavors. I like spicy foods and drinks, so I thought it was fairly tasty, though the flavor had a slightly-off taste.<br /><br />I tried it first as a hot drink. However, since it was a fairly warm day I added ice cubes. Either way is fine, though it reminds me of the kind of thing I would drink if I was suffering from a cold.<br /><br />I suspect it's a healthier drink than most, but 70 calories a glass is a bit steep for me.",0
"It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!",0
"It's much more better than potato soup form same company, so I like it.<br />Also stir with milk and boil, it's taste good.<br />However, its' salty too me. taste good, but too much sodium!",0
"and she will evetually ""give in"" and eat this food, but she doesn't ""dive right in"" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!",0
"My bad. I ordered this in July and Amazon shipped it via UPS, with the OK to leave the package outside the house - when it was 95 degrees out. We had gummy soup in all those little packages. We put them in the fridge and ended up with gummy squares that were very chewy, but still tasted good. Lesson learned!",0
"With the French-roast beans I usually buy, I open the bag and am hit with a strong aroma; inside I are dark and nearing black, shiny beans.  But with this coffee, I get a very faint aroma from slightly more than medium-roasted beans.  The flavor is mellow and slightly acidic.  I was not very impressed; but then, I am highly partial to a dark roast.  Bad batch?  Perhaps.  If you like a dark, robust, French roast, then be wary of Eight O'Clock.",0
I was expecting homemade creamy soft banana bread.  I bit it and was a little surprised by the texture.  It almost had a crispy quality to it- like the innards of a Crunch bar.  There were little crisp pieces in every bite!  Not like my homemade recipe AT ALL.  Back to the actual bread part of the banana bread- it was good!  Not the same as homemade- but it was good!  It also had walnut pieces on it- which is great for nut lovers like me!  I prefer pecans on banana bread- but walnuts will do.,0
"Taste great, clean with no aftertaste.  Better than filtered water from my fridge, slightly.  Worth the extra money, not really. With just one bottle, there isn't a way for us to tell if this water would make a differnce say after 1 week, month, year. At this point, we don't think it's worth the extra money to give it a try for that long.",0
"One of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda; so I was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when I popped open my can of Switch Orange Tangerine. To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It's sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to ""mixed fruit."" It's 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you're not expecting orange you may like it. So far, the taste winner for cute little cans for me is Izze's Grapefruit, which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation, with the right amount of sweetness.",0
"I noticed nothing different about the flavor or lightness/heaviness of this water. It was water.  I tested the ph and it real only 8.4, which is still better than tap water, but they advertise 9,5.  I will say that my test may not have been wholly accurate, but because I had only one bottle, I couldn't check it against another bottle not run several tests to see what the consistent measurement will .",0
"1st case was awesome.  2nd case was full of damaged, leaking and some empty boxes.  We, discarded this 2nd case in fear of contamination.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Rick",0
"I bought one of these at a store and thought I would order a box of the Peanut Butter-Dark Chocolate Protein online. I am not sure if it is the heat of the summer or off batches but the last two 12 packs I have ordered have been in date but as hard as rock. Not like the individual one I bought in the store. Also, it is a delicious bar and barely impacts my blood sugar so makes a great on-the-run snack.  Note: I don't taste the peanut butter at all. I like peanut butter so was a bar disappointed but the bars are still tasty.",0
"I did not realize the sunflower seeds were still in the husks. Otherwise, I'm sure they were just fine.",0
"I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for ""emergency"" use for me.",0
"I bought it before.  Pops up small and crunchy.  Loved it.  Shipping cost the same as the popcorn....$10.  But this time when I went to order it shipping was $14.  That's where I draw the line.  When it costs more to ship it than the product costs, then I don't need it.",0
"I've been buying these for years and my dog loves them. They make a great reward treat and they're easy to carry ... well, they used to be. I got a bag of crumbs this time. What happened to the nice little cubes? It's not the end of the world, but it makes them more difficult to stuff in your pocket as you go out the door -- unless you don't mind a pocket full of crumbs.",0
"While Nana's makes generally excellent cookies, this particular formula is quite strange.  The orange zest flavor is incredibly strong and it has oddly crunchy rice-like bits in it that aren't great.  I'm sure that there are probably fans of this recipe out there, but I wouldn't order it again.",0
"I was not expecting it, but this bar has what seems to be a watered-down yogurt coating.<br /><br />The bar tastes fairly decent, but I wouldn't exactly call it oatmeal raisin.  It has a distinct raw cookie dough flavoring to it.  There doesn't seem to be much oatmeal taste.<br /><br />There are plenty of other bars out there with less fat (and FAR less saturated fat) that actually taste better.  This is a quality bar, no doubt, as are all Kashi products, but I would not care to use it as a meal replacement on a daily basis.",0
"I didn't realize there was sugar in the Stevia until it came.  It tastes really good, but I didn't want the sugar.",0
"I took a chance and bought this coffee because of the reviews.  I have to agree abut the bold flavor and taste. I guess you wondering why I only gave it 3 stars.  It's the dam cheap as K-cups!!  I've only had two that didn't bursting while brewing.  My wife, who loves this coffee, is getting tired of seeing all of the floaties (grounds) in her cup.  And that's just half of the issue because now I need to clean out the keurig for the next time want coffee.",0
"I use to love this Knorr sauce.  In fact, many years ago I worked in a restaurant where we exclusively used the Knorr Hollandaise sauce for Eggs Benedict.  Regular customers would occasionally ask for ""the recipe"".  If they only knew!<br /><br />A few years ago, my wife and I both noticed that Knorr must have changed something with this packaged sauce.  The flavor is now fairly bland as compared the way this product use to be.  Thinking it was a batch that had been incorrectly mixed, we purchased it a handful of times over the last fews years.  We've come to the conclusion that this is the way it's now being made.  As such, I'm looking for a better packaged Hollandaise mix.  What a shame.",0
"It's summertime and I have dry hair and scalp resulting in an itchy head.  Although this conditioner does get the tangles out, it hasn't made my hair any better but, it's not any worse either.  I just don't see any results.<br /><br />I dislike the smell of the shampoo which I think smells like play-doh but the conditioner isn't that bad.<br /><br />I have used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty's Dry Scalp Shampoo & Conditioner and saw results immediately.<br /><br />I found this conditioner to be very average.  I don't think I'd recommend it.",0
"I ( my dog ) have been using CET chews since we got him.  Previously was using the smaller stick when he was a puppy, but needed something bigger now that he is older.  Like the other CET sticks, he has great oral hygiene, good breath, nice white teeth, and no problems at the vet.  The only downside of this particular product is the SMELL.  My dog likes to sit next to me and chew it and I have to cover my nose.  It's an odd, nauseating odor that can fill the entire house.  I probably wont be buying these again for that reason, but will go back to the sticks without the odor.",0
"Another over-priced ""plank"" by Ernest.  Why do people like these?  This is the 2nd flavor I've tried and find them to be big, thick ""planks"" of puffed up cereal with a few almonds sprinkled in and a few dried fruit pieces.  When these are gone I'll never repurchase.  High sugar and carbs, way too much money and not worth it.  Any chewy granola bar is a better deal.  2 Servings each?  Then double the fat content to 14 grams and nearly 60 grams of carbs and 28 grams of sugar if you indulge and eat the whole thing!  Holy..  Anyway, at only 6 per box you are ransoming your mother to buy these.",0
"I know and agree with most other reviewers about the cats sticking their noses up at this food but unfortunately after my 18 yr old cat, Jazmen, was diagnosed with early stage kidney disease and was also diagnosed with diabetes (but with diet we have this under control) this is what the vet has recommended. I mix a little pumpkin in bc it can make her constipated. She has gotten used to it and does ""happily"" eat it now. If it prolongs her life and keeps her kidneys healthy that's all that matters to me. I do give her some Wellness pouches as treats once in awhile bc that is what she ate before and she just LOVES them. They are still relatively healthy being grain free and it is what I feed my other cats.",0
"My daughter likes them ok, but everyone else that has tried them thinks that they're too sweet, possibly from the added sugar. Not going to buy again.",0
"The Roland Original Israeli Couscous was not the same as I have previously ordered. The size of each piece of toasted pasta was half the size of the real ""original"". Instead of pearl pasta it is closer to standard couscous. I was disappointed with this aspect of my purchase and will look for another manufacturer.",0
"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in this cookie--the marketing promises whole grain Quaker Oats, plenty of fiber, and ""natural"" chocolate and almond flavor. Plus it comes from the good folks at Quaker Oats. And yes, whole grain oat flour is listed first among the ingredients, and yes, each cookie contains 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the RDA). The taste, however (and let's be honest, here--why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run-of-the-mill hard-baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft-baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland. If I'm going to eat 180 calories worth of cookie, I'm going to opt for a much tastier indulgence than this.",0
"I don't really have much confidence in any commercial pet food,  but the  ingredient list for Newmans's seems better than most.",0
"I am all about adding the wonders of antioxidants into my morning routine with a tasty boost of pomegranate, but this product IS NOT the way to get your daily doze.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy to carry in a drink stick pack<br />- Healthy alternative to canned energy drinks with no crash<br />- Contains more natural ingredients than most energy drinks<br />- Gives a small boost in energy<br />- High in vitamins an anti-oxidants (read info for exact details)<br />- EBOOST puts some of their process towards the National Breast Cancer Research<br /><br />Cons<br />- Tastes like medicine a cross between TUMS and Alka Seltzer<br />- Very, very bitter mixed berry<br />- Truly awful<br /><br />Taste is too important so the cons outweigh the pros.",0
We tried every which way to make this coffee. It is frustrating that each coffee must have it's own system to work. I gave up but not to worry I passed the coffee on to my sister. She was so pleased with the gift. She used a French press and said it worked fine for her. It was a full bodied coffee and good for that early morning wake up.,0
"My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesn't seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{",0
"This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.",0
"The sauce was great. I enjoyed it with some tacos and later with some frozen taquitos.  Both were improved by adding this sauce -- pretty generously, since it was so good.<br /><br />I didn't think it was spicy -- so if you're looking for a kick, look elsewhere.  It was a great taste, just no kick.<br /><br />My disappointment -- the drop in a star -- is that the product expired within just a few weeks of getting it.  Maybe it sat on the shelf for a while, I don't know, but I was a little bummed to throw out half of the bottle because it expired.<br /><br />So, I would be concerned if I were purchasing 6 of these (as a pack).  Do they ship with only a few weeks left?  I hope my situation was an anomaly, and others can comment on what their expiration dates were.",0
"Pepperidge Farms is becoming slack with the flavor of the infamous goldfish. Compared to the small size bag(6oz), this 30 oz carton taste like plain goldfish and not the flavor blast xtra cheddar we like so much and wanted to purchase. Price was right; however, it would have been great to have experienced the FLAVOR BLAST of XTRA CHEDDAR taste.",0
"I have used Science Diet for almost 20 yrs. I started seeing bad reviews about it. The cornmeal, meat bi-products, etc... So I researched cat food and came across Blue Buffalo. It seemed to be a great food for my cats. So I slowly switched my cats from Science Diet to Blue Buffalo. One of my four cats is now taking meds to get rid of his UTI. He's 7 yrs old and has never had one before. I can't say for sure it's caused by the Blue Buffalo but the vet told us to be safe and switch back to Science Diet. Truth is, not sure why I switched in the first place, my one Persian lived 19 1/2 yrs on Science Diet. My other three cats seem to LOVE Blue Buffalo, more so than the Science Diet. But to be safe I have to switch back. So if you decide to try Blue Buffalo, just keep an eye on your cat(s) and make sure they don't start licking themselves a lot or peeing in places they aren't supposed to.",0
"I must have somehow ""missed"" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.",0
"I was excited to try these cookies as the combination of two of my favorite flavors sounded unbeatable.  Unfortunately, they weren't quite what I had hoped.<br /><br />The texture was the greatest disappointment:  they were coarse, granular cookies without the snap.  To be fair, making the texture of any gluten-free baked good is challenging, but there is room for improvement.  Midel<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPP588"">Mi-Del, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> does a better job getting the texture right for a gingersnap.  I was actually hoping the texture would be more like Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies<br />with Crystallized Ginger<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMFU"">Pamela's Products Spicy Ginger Cookies, 5.29-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Those have a firm texture with a bit of give in the middle.<br /><br />I was also hoping for a stronger ginger flavor, as found in Midel and Pamela's products.  The ginger is there, but it is  initially subtle, gaining in heat with more chewing or a greater quantity.  I think the idea of the cookie half dipped in chocolate makes it special, but there again, the chocolate was not  as strong or rich as it might have been.<br /><br />I shared them with two other people to get their response.  One thought they were just okay, lamenting the mildness of the ginger; the other liked the texture and flavor, and was very happy to finish the box!",0
I have tried 2 brands of brewed cocoa beans and don't care for either.  I will stick to my tea.,0
"I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.",0
"recently, i have been trying to find ways to get energy during the day that doesn't come from caffeine or soda. so when i saw this product, i thought i would give it a go. i tried it one morning in a bottle of water and i felt like i was drinking the dregs of melted ice cubes from a fruit flavroed beverage like kool-aid or crystal light. to add to this, i didn't feel the least bit energized. so i had my morning coffee a little later. i don't think this product is a total fail. a shot in a glass of orange juice might do a body wonders for waking up in the morning.",0
"It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less.  This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't!<br /><br />But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi.  Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!!  It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says ""toasted nori""!  The cookbook is just terrible.  In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it!  But you learn what you realy need to do quickly.<br /><br />Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the ""kit"" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started.",0
"Bought these for my wife. She absolutely loved the See's chocolate mix, which was great. The reason for 3 stars was the horribly inflated shipping prices. $13 shipping for $15 worth of chocolate??? Will not be ordering again.",0

"I have two cats who are snack-motivated (the third is not, so her vote is not included), and we tried both the Salmon and the Chicken Crunch n Clean. It's a bit on the pricey side, but as anyone who has ever tried to brush their cat's teeth will tell you, anything that can lend a hand in kitty dental hygiene can be worth it. The cats didn't seem to have a preference between Chicken and Salmon, both chased and gobbled the treats immediately. There's the problem, though: whether it's the size or texture of the treats, or just down to the individual cat, only one of the two cats (same size, generally same disposition) bothered to chew. The other just swallowed it whole. I don't mind giving the cats treats, but prefer other brands for their ""junk food"". In this case, only one of them was getting the possibility of a dental benefit.",0

Why do some reviewers seem to expect Italian coffee house products in each and every product made for K-Cups?  This is a Very Nice Cappuccino / French Vanilla flavored drink.  It is well above what you find in some gas stations - and not as good as in some others.  Just because you get it in a gas station does not make it bad - go to Italy and find out.  This makes a very acceptable cup using the middle or lowest setting.  Remember - less is stronger.<br /><br />60 cal (40 fat)  --  4.5g fat sat  --  9 carb  --  5g sugar  --  0g fiber,0

These are tasty but they regularly explode in my microwave at work flipping the bowl over and coating the inside of the microwave with soup.  The label warns of this due to uneven heating but it's scary when it happens.,0

"The flakes are a healthy and quick breakfast to prepare, but the texture is pretty mushy, like baby food.

"I tried Kellog's Raisin Bran, and this cereal is very tasty. There is just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar in the product. When the bran flakes are mixed with milk, I must admit the cinnamon and sugar tastes are awesome.  The reason why I only gave this product three stars is that the raisins and almonds are a little sparse. The raisins are plump and juicy, and the toasted almonds are crunchy and complement the cereal well.  Unfortunately, this cereal is mostly bran flakes. I think Kellog's needs to add more raisins and ramp up the almond content to the amount found in the Honey Bunches of Oats Cereals.  Then this Raisin Bran would be outstanding.",0

"Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7"" inches long and a little less than 1"" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-)",0
"After reading the good reviews others have left about these chili-lime soy nuts, I expected the flavor to really ""pop""...but instead, it was very, very bland. I found myself going to my pantry to get my chili-lime popcorn seasoning and pour gobs of it on these to make them palatable. Such a shame, as they are very high quality soy nuts otherwise, and well roasted.<br /><br />If you are expecting a savory, tangy southwestern flavor, these soy nuts will not please you at all. You would be just as well to order the plain salted version. As for me, since I foolishly ordered 12 bags of these(the smallest quantity offered), I guess I will need to now go to my supermarket and invest a large amount of additional money on LOTS more popcorn seasoning...",0

"Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, ""Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical."".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks",0
"I purchased a few of these weeks ago at a price of $4.49 for a pack of 25. The french roast is very good. I use the ekobrew cup but, have had residuals left in my cup, I found if you tamp down the coffee after you fill it, it's not quite as bad. This coffee was a convenience with a good price but, I went to purchase more and they have gone from $4.49 to a so-called crossed out retail price, to an on sale price of $11.99 in a little over three weeks...Sale???? Made my last purchase until they get over their greedy period.. I can by a pound of fresh ground coffee my choice of grind and roast, for around $8.00 a pound and get three times as many cups of coffee for $3.99 less... Too bad...",0

"The Haribo Roulettes are OK. Its nothing great though.<br />And the flavors come in:<br />-Yellow: Lemon. It was ok<br />-Clear: Pineapple. I usually don't like pineapple but I like how these tasted<br />-Orange: Orange flavored. Not strong but theres enough flavor in it<br />-Green: I think this is suppose to be apple but I can't taste it no matter how many times I eat it<br />-Red: Strawberry (Very slight hint of it)<br /><br />I ordered a box of these but I don't think I will again. There was nothing wrong with em but there was nothing special to me about them either.<br /><br />If you've tried Haribo Gold Gummy Bears and noticed how FIRM the Gummy was, these are exactly the same.<br /><br />You have to chew these quite a bit so they can make your jaw sore (mine was after the third roll).<br />If you like something to chew on thats firm then these are for you.<br /><br />Unfortunately I like soft gummies that don't require too much chewing so these aren't exactly for me.<br /><br />Each of the Gummies are about the same size as a penny but about 8cm thick. I thought they would be a little bigger too from the Amazon picture.<br />The Entire Roll has 10 pieces each and is about 3 inches long (not counting the twisted wrapper ends).<br /><br />If you've never tried Haribo before, go the grocers and buy a bag of Haribo Gold to get a general idea of their firmness before spending any more money on larger quantities.",0
"I'm an enthusiatic cinnamon lover and granola eater, and I really wanted to like these more. There is a distinct cinnamon taste, but this product is too dry to be eaten alone for my taste. I decided to try them in some vanilla yogurt, and liked them much better. The hard dryness allows them to no become overly soggy too quickly. There are some ""clusters"" but the contents of the package reminded more of loose grain given to horses. So, they just get an ""OK"" from me.",0
Not porous or particularly soft. Should work well for cooking or anything that would require melting it. By itself it's too hard to eat.,0

"I tried this because someone said how high quality it is,  well my cats moseyed over to it,  ate a little then sashayed over to the kibble and ate a little.

"I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for ""emergency"" use for me.",0

"It takes a lot more of this product to flavor a 16-20oz water bottle than I expected, and I was anticipating more of a tang flavor. That being said, I would rather use this product than one filled with artificial ingredients. Also, unrelated to the product itself, the company first sent me the wrong order and then the bottle came broken and leaking from the box.  I had a new one sent within the week, but was still a hassle. Took up to 3 weeks to get my actual order. Again, that inconvenience isn't reflected in my rating.",0
"I ordered two twelve-packs of this childhood memory.  Cost came to about $2.00 per can (only bottles in my childhood).  Flavor was as remembered and I am enjoying this rather expensive treat.  Unfortunately, the twelve-packs were packaged in an ordinary cardboard box with no protective padding.  Almost all of the cans were dented, with 6 cans burst open or leaking.  All cans had to be rinsed of sticky soda.  This raised my cost by about .50 per can.  Can't beat the as-remembered taste but was more expensive than hoped and packaged problematically.",0
"It is a nice looking storage option and saves space, but I expected the drawer to slide out without so much difficulty. It is very jerky and tough to pull out and and push in. I thought maybe I did something wrong but it is pretty simple. I applied some WD 40 to the slide (with much wiping to get the excess off) and that did not help.<br />Has anyone else had this trouble, and were you able to remedy it?",0
"I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them. This one's not bad.  It's got a bit of a fruit-punchy flavor with only a mildly bitter aftertaste from the energy ingredients.  In fact I like it better than most I've tried, with the exception of the Arizona Az Energy drinks, which are more fruity with less bitter afterwards. It does have a lot of sugar, though: 260 calories from high fructose corn syrup and various fruit juice concentrates.  I'll try anything once, and in a pinch I'd try this one again, but next time I think I'll try the sugar free variety.",0

"Spry Peppermint appears to be a healthy alternative to other chewing gums.  Peppermint oil is used in the manufacture of this product; raw materials come from China and the USA.  Each chiclet is small.  Two pieces might be considered one serving.<br /><br />I like the peppermint taste, which lasts for one minute -- yes, one minute as timed by my stopwatch.  After that minute most of the taste is gone.  It seems like much of any benefit the gum might provide will be lost if it is thrown away by minute two of chewing.  Recommended with noted reservations.",0
"hi every one I just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product. First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar.

"Be aware that the title and the whole listing is wrong, I didn't receive six sets, or 1 lb worth of tea, I received 1 gift set.<br /><br />That being said I and my family drink tea daily. Between the three of us we go through about a gallon a day, usually a plain variety of orange Pekoe and/or Black tea. However, I like to mix it up and try new teas, and I fell in love with the quality stash teas after my boyfriend bought me a huge variety pack, so when I'm looking for something new I tend to gravitate towards the Stash brand.<br /><br />As soon as you remove the cellophane you get a very inviting aroma from each box, I tried 2 out of the 3 both hot and cold, and 1 (the cranberry) I only drank cold.<br /><br />Cinnamon Vanilla<br />I found this to be very sweet, so I would suggest cutting your sugar back by 25% - this one was my least favorite<br /><br />Warm: I preferred it warm over iced, which is rare. The flavors are much fuller while it's warm and the aromatics are better appreciated that way too,I tried it first with out milk, it was okay, almost reminiscent of warm apple cider sans the apple, after I added milk and it transformed into a liquid cinnamon bun! That was a delight!...at first. It was one of those things that the more you drank it the less you enjoyed it, the cinnamon began to overwhelm you and the sweet notes became clawing.. - My mother didn't like it plain or with milk.<br /><br />Cold: It's just shy of ""Okay"" while cold. the flavor's become very sharp and one noted it still kind of reminds me of an apple cider due to it's predominate sweet and cinnamon flavor, I haven't tried it cold with milk yet. later I mixed it 50/50 with our regular brew hoping to cut the overwhelming flavors, it didn't help any.<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice.<br />the pumpkin spice was my second favorite,<br />Warm: it was quite similar to the cinnamon vanilla as far as it being very aromatic but much more balanced, the clove dominated and while it didn't taste anything like a pumpkin pie (it contains no actual pumpkin) it did have a nice earthy notes to it.  It was easy to enjoy this one both warm and cold although I also preferred this over being warm. I added milk while it was still warm and preferred it with out. The milk didn't really compliment the flavors.<br /><br />Cold: The same thing happen with the cinnamon vanilla with it being cold, the notes are a little sharper, but it was still really enjoyable<br /><br />Cranberry Pomegranite.<br />I only drank this one cold, as I'm not big on warm fruits, I made a half gallon using 2 bags of stash and 2 bags of black tea, this gave it a nice fruity hint while still being a full bodied tea. I enjoyed this one the most, probably because I enjoy fruited teas over spiced teas, but also because the taste was enough to enjoy it, but not so much that you were overwhelmed with strong flavors.",0

"UPDATED 5/28/12:<br />I see the price of these has gone up more than 50%, although I believe the earlier price was in error, so I will not be buying these in the future. It seems that buying 24 cans in warehouse packaging should be a better deal than this is offering to us. In addition my last two shipments were a bit less fish and more oil than the first ones. For those reasons I have dropped my earlier rating of 5 to 3 stars.<br /><br />Incidentally, I never received a response from the company as to why the front of the can says 120gm and the box says 95gm.<br />========================<br /><br />In the words of that wonderful Tina Turner classic- ""Simply the Best.""<br /><br />These are excellent in almost every way. Only the can itself could be improved.  I will admit that the container can be quite a challenge.  While it pops open easily, peeling the top gets progressively more difficult as you proceed.  It is nearly impossible to remove the lid entirely- and truly impossible to do so without ejecting  a bit of the oil from the can.  According to the packaging and can imprints, the sardines are caught wild and canned in Morocco. I think the containers might be made from abandoned WW II German tanks.<br /><br />That said, it is well worth the struggle.  Every can of the original 24 was fully packed with 4 fairly large, tan in color sardines: skinless (there were perhaps three sardines in the 24  cans with the slightest trace of skin remaining) and absolutely no bone. The taste and texture are excellent.  I have never had any particular thrill from olive oil, so the fact that these are in soy oil (and filled to the brim) was no problem for me to say the least.  Lightly salted (for sardines). You will almost surely be consuming 100% of the can content.<br /><br />This might not be the first choice of the top-tier of gourmet consumers (I am not one), but I can not imagine any sardine lover, nor many non-lovers, not being extremely pleased with this product.<br /><br />This is truly a 5-star selection.<br /><br />Note that while the front of the box says: ""Net Wt. 4.25 OZ (120g)""<br />the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box show it as 95g  which is 3.35 OZ<br />===================<br />From the packaging:<br />Serving size 1 can (95g) Servings per container 1<br />Amount per serving: (% = % Daily Value)<br />Calories 220 Calories from Fat 130<br />Total Fat 14g (21%)<br /> Saturated Fat 3g (17%)<br /> Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 35mg (12%)<br />Sodium 360mg (15%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 0g<br />Protein 24g (48%)<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 6%<br />Iron 10%<br />Contains 2g of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving<br />Ingredients: Sardines, Soy Bean Oil, Salt<br />==================",0

I learned right away that I have several issues with them:  (1) They have kind of an off-odor, almost like turpentine.  (2) My cats weren't impressed.  They sniffed the treats, sort of chewed on them, then walked away. (3) The treats must be refrigerated after opening, which is not a huge problem but can be inconvenient at times. Try the chicken flavor instead -- the cats love it!",0
"With my son's nut allergy, I'm always on the lookout for safe snacks.  We get a little tired of rice krispie treats & goldfish around here!<br />These were pretty pricey for the amount of food contained, but for a pre-packaged safe snack we thought we'd give them a try.<br />Basically, like other reviewers, my son picked out the pieces he liked & now I have a pantry full of leftover bits from these.<br />He liked the fruit snacks, but we can find peanut-safe fruit snacks fairly easily in the grocery store.<br />He also liked the chocolate cookie, but it's pretty hard & crumbly.<br />We both liked the trail mix enough to go hunt it down & buy it with subscribe & save here on Amazon.  The flavor included is mountain mambo, which we LOVE.  We also bought bags of the other flavor, beach bash, which is sweeter, with dried pineapple but no chocolate chips (my son loved the little chocolate chips in the mountain mambo).<br />The crackers & sunbutter were left over.<br />I think sunbutter is great - sweeter than soybutter & tastes more like real peanut butter to me, but my son is so used to soybutter that he wants nothing to do with the sunbutter packet (which was the main reason we bought these - to have portable small portions of sunbutter).<br />I occasionally will eat the sunbutter on the crackers, but the crackers are tough - not very kid-friendly.<br />Overall I think it's a handy snack if you're going hiking or camping, but probably won't work for us.  We might use the parts for a roadtrip or everyday snack, but it really costs too much to pick apart like we did.",0

I served the noodles for dinner and in the middle of the night my fianc&eacute; woke up with a splitting headache that went on for hours. The ingredients are organic wheat flour (70%) and organic buckwheat flour (30%). Shame on me for not reading the teeny tiny print but also, shame on these companies who intentionally mislead consumers with false labeling. Don't call something ""buckwheat noodles"" when they are, in fact, only 30% buckwheat! Also: Japan's favorite is made in Australia? Go figure.",0

"Barrilla's pasta is basically canned spaghetti but the sauce is separate - making for firmer, tastier pasta when you heat it. 70 seconds was enough to heat to my taste.<br /><br />I had tried a different Barrilla pasta before and it was a bit too firm.  With this one I tried the alternative cooking method and that worked better.<br /><br />Sauce was TOO SWEET.  No aftertaste so not a disaster.<br /><br />Low fat, (5g/ 1g sat) Sodium 700mg - ok if you're good for 2,000 mg a day. 6g(!) of fiber. That's pretty good.<br /><br />Summary.  It's decent but it wouldn't be my first choice among the Barrilla meals.",0

"This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of ""menadione sodium sulfite in pet food"" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.",0
"Okay, I like ragu pasta sauce. I dont have a problem with the sauce. My problem is with the price. Without the subscribe and save, plust the RAGUKNRR coupon savingss this is WAY to high. I was expecting way bigger jars of sauce. I have purchased these in the store on sale for $1.50 each, so for $2.31 a piece after all the coupons is not the best deal.  Not for me anyway.",0
"The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.",0
"I purchased this toy based on the recommendation from Dr. Ian Dunbar in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577314557"">Before and After Getting Your Puppy: The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dog</a> and it was fantastic for about two weeks.<br /><br />The toy was banged up against the wall and table a few times in the normal course of play and the plastic screw-top shattered.<br /><br />My border collie puppy still will play with it now even though it's missing pieces and doesn't hold food anymore. This is great, but it's pretty much become an expensive rope toy.<br /><br />I wish I had known before purchasing that it was so delicate. A much sturdier food dispensing toy has been the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLTOKK"">Kibble Nibble Original, 7"" tall x 6"" dia</a> which has rubber bumpers that prevent the same shattering that happened to the tug-a-jug.",0
"I like a good Colombian coffee, so I thought I'd give these k-cups a try. The coffee is good, but not great. I normally brew the 8oz cup size and the result was a fairly weak cup of coffee. They should have made this an ""extra bold"" product with a little more coffee grounds in it.<br /><br />The flavor and balance is good, but I expect just a little bit more bite in a Colombian blend. I don't especially think these k-cups are worth the extra cost. So while I'll be happy to finish drinking them in the 6oz brew, I won't buy them again.<br /><br />I would have given then 3.5 stars if I could and would go to four if they made this in extra bold.",0
"I purchased this today, and promptly fired off a batch of popcorn with 1/4 tsp. of this stuff added to the popping oil.  The flavor is movie theater-ish, but I still feel like I'm missing the full effect because I'm not popping in coconut oil.  Still, this stuff delivered some of the flavor I was looking for, and adhered to the popcorn just fine because I didn't use it as a sprinkling salt after the popping process was finished.  Honestly though...the price here on Amazon is outrageous.  I went to my local warehouse store that starts with an ""S"" and ends with an ""am's Club"", and purchased the same sized jug for under 3 bucks plus tax.",0
"I hoped to be different, but like other reviewers I did not recieve a very good mix of ""samples"". I recieved 6 mints, 8 earl grays, etc leaving me with just a few to try instead of 10 different kinds like i hoped. Luckily, i really did like the mint so it sorta kinda worked out in the end.",0
"This is an o.k. product for wet food for my Chihuahuas & I love the size & price.  The subscription process gives me a lower price & I don't worry about running out.  My dogs are now on a really good dry food for small dogs but the almost 2 years I used this wet one, I was happy.",0
"After the Protein Water in the bottle could not be found any where, I found the Mix in Amazon and tried, the taste is not the same, you can adjust it not to be too strong, or lighter but it still gave you an mild after taste.The good thing about it is it costs so much less, so I stay with it, after a while, you get used to and it still good after all.",0
"I am disappointed with this product, not that the product itself is bad but that most of the shipped bags were probably old as most had lost their tight vacuum packaging. The loss of tight vacuum in my experience results in the loss of full aroma that is costumary with a fresh packaged bag of coffee. I didn't see an expiration date mark anywhere so I couldn't confirm my suspition. When fresh I highly recommend this product to any sofisticated coffee lover.",0
"My cats would not eat this flavor, I had to give it away to a friend. While Im not saying this product is bad in any way, if your cat is picky, it may not like this flavor.",0
"Maybe I'm spoiled by all the great split-pea soups I've had over the years, but really ... it should be hard to mess up split pea soup.  The taste of this Progresso is OK, but the main ingredient is whole in-the-skin green peas in a very thin soup.  The whole peas are undercooked somewhat so are a bit hard and chewy and they all float on top of the soup.  I know ... peas are peas are peas, but this is just weird visually and in texture when eating the soup.  I expect a split pea soup to be made with split peas and to be fairly thick as far as soup goes.  Oh, and there's over 1500 mg of sodium in one can, 690 per one cup serving.",0
"This is an outstanding product.  The taste is unbelievable for a instant coffee.  If you match this with the Creme Brulee flavored creamer from Coffee Mate, it is fantastic.  You don't need at add anything else.  Right amount of sweetness and complexity as the (artificial) flavors intertwine in a sweet harmonic dance of awesomeness.  You can also drink this black and enjoy the nutty flavor.  None of the aftertaste or characteristics that accompany an instant coffee.  The vanilla and regular Tasters Choice is not even close to this one.  They got it right with this product.  If you enjoy coffee, you will love this product.<br /><br />The best is when you take your cup and jump in a cold car the sweet smell fills your car.  Step out of the car for a second and jump in again, it will be worth it.  Unbelievable.  Try it.  works good in a small car anyway.<br /><br />Such a great product thus it saddens me not to give it the full five star rating.  Just because of the packaging.<br /><br />This is great coffee that needs to be back in the canister.  Please take a moment to send a comment to Nescafe Tasters Choice website under the 'contact us' section.  Its more expensive in the packets under the guise of 'convenience' or 'freshness'.  Lies.  Don't be fooled people.<br /><br />Read a comments under the canisters of this coffee and you will see more.",0
I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.,0
The Bobs Red Mill semolina flour was ok. I was to use it in my pasta maker. I think I didn't let it mix well enough or something because it seemed a little to dry to push the pasta through. It ended up getting clogged and actually popped of my extruding disc. I used regular flour instead of the semolina and that came out perfect. I think  I just need to play with the ratio of egg to flour a little more next time. The pasta machine is a Simac Pastamatic MX 700. It's a wonderful machine and I haven't had any trouble except for the one time. I will try to remember to update this the next time I try the semolina again.,0
"This is definetely not the Colombian produced Milo I grew up with. It varies in flavor from country to country of origin. Not bad, but not the same",0
"This bar is VERY delicious (but also a little too sweet). You should avoid at all costs if you are on a strict bodybuilding diet. A lot of sugar (bad carbs) and very little protein. But if you are allowed a cheat snack, eat this!",0
"FONTINA VAL D'AOSTA cheese, sold by IGOURMET, is a tasty, raw-milk cheese. It is NOT the most tasty cheese I have ever had, (that place being rserved for Royal Port de Salut cheese, with Royal Havarti cheese being a close second.)  But this fontina val d'aosta cheese IS tasty, especially when allowed to stand out of the refrigerator and on the table for a while.<br /><br />This is a firm cheese, but it cuts easily with a sharp knife.  The (I hope!), edible rind of this cheese has a nice, somewhat smoother flavour, and is of a texture comparable to bread with a very slightly-more-than-normal hardness, but still delicious and edible, nontheless.  The cheese itself has a nice, but very mild flavour, and even though the ingredients do not list ""liquid smoke"", or anything smoked, in the ingredients, the very faintest of smoky flavour does come through -- at least to me.  It tastes a like very lightly-flavoured Swiss cheese.<br /><br />The ingredients listed for this cheese are simple: Unpasteurized milk, Rennet, Salt.  The salt flavour is NOT apparent in the flavour -- but if you eat enough of this cheese, you will get very thirsty, which is a sure sign of salt in anything!<br /><br />Unpasteurized, (or ""raw"") milk cheeses might -- if some at the ""august and SO very learned"" FDA have their way -- become illegal in the USA(!)  Or so I have read on the Internet.  This is the reason I bought this, and another type of unpasteurized cheese.  I've never had unpasteurized cheese before -- so I wanted to sample it before it becomes illegal!  Those ""wonderful"" fuss-budgets at the Federal Food and Drug Administration, (FDA), seeming are SO concerned about the welfare of the American people, that they fail to notice that unpasteurized cheese....and unpasteurized milk.....when carefully made, under sanitary conditions, does NOT kill anyone!  I can personally attest to drinking (legal!) raw milk....which did not taste differently, as I remember, from pasteurized milk.  Only it's supposed to have more nutrition.  It stands to reason that, if unpasteurized cheese did kill people, much of France, (where Louis Pasteur was born!), and the rest of Europe, would probably be dead by now.  But they aren't!  Will unpasteurized milk and cheese kill only Americans, but not Europeans, then?  Or is this just one more way our ""beloved"" Federal Government wants to impress their power over the rest of us -- their consituents, who voted these ""PUBLIC SERVANTS"", of ours, into office.  (Will Rogers said that he wanted to ""go down to Washington and see how our HIRED HELP is doing.""  And, in all reality, that IS what these ""powerful"" people really are...!)<br /><br />A few years ago, visiting relatives in Canada, I came upon a packet of ""Sweet N Low"" artificial sweetener.  Reading on the label that it contained CYCLAMATE, I threw it away -- because, in the USA, cyclamates have not been legal for at least 20 years, and I didn't want to injest anything that old.  Then I rememberered -cyclamates are STILL LEGAL IN CANADA.  Do cyclamates, then, kill Americans and not Canadians?  Or is this just another power-play by American ""Food and Drug"" officials?  It is all very confusing and disillusioning to someone born and bred in the (seemingly?) ""land of the brave, and home of the free"".  Or is that actually, ""the land of the slave, and the home of the thief?""<br /><br />At any rate, I do hope our beloved FDA will never make unpasteurized cheese, such as this ""Fontine Val d'Aosta"", Italian cheese, illegal.<br />It's only cheese, true -- but if they take away our freedom to eat unpasteurized cheese....what next will they take away.  Hmmm....as this IS Italian cheese.....maybe the Mafia DOES have a few good purposes, after all?",0
"Well, after being a total fan of Black Forest gummy bears, I was not overly impressed with the Haribo brand, Haribo may be a German company, but these gummy bears are now MADE IN TUREKY for Haribo USA, which is stated clearly on the bag. Compared to the Black Forest brand, they are rather hard and not nearly as flavorful. I guess everyone has different tastes, but now I have 12 lbs of these, which I really can't imagine eating!",0

"I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.",0

"I've bought this dog food in the past but don't feed it in it's straight form very often to my dogs.  The first ingredient is corn, which is the first ingredient in most crunchy snack foods.  If you feed your dog this as it's main food, it's  almost like feeding your child a straight diet of Doritos.  They may taste good, but they won't keep you healthy for long.  It's not a bad dog food, and there are a lot worse brands out there, and it'll do when money is tight and you need to feed your dog.  Today I saw a 42 lb bag of Purina Beneful at SAM's club for right at 32 dollars.",0
"This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.  After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.",0
"I had hoped they'd give me more of a chance to see their reaction, but typically they are pretty easy to please. I guess I can't complain since they are eating it. They are full grown English Mastiffs, the size of small ponies. Feeding them gets expensive. The price at Amazon is fair, and if you order 2 bags or more shipping is free.<br /><br />This 15 lb bag arrived in a box with paper padding/filler, packed well and saved me a trip to the store. I think it is a good option to have free delivery from Amazon and not to have to lug big bags of dog food from supermarket to car to home, especially with a bad back.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes I had hoped for more from Purina. It seems to contain a lot of corn filler. Read the ingredients in the product description to see if it is what you desire, or you think your breed would like. Otherwise, ordering from Amazon seems like a good thing.",0
"The taste is pretty ok but it is too sweet for me. If you do not like sweet bar, skip this.",0
"I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.",0
"I typically like this type of jerky.  These bags were dry, and had short expiration dates.  I am disappointed that amazon would ship these out with such close dates of expiration.",0
"Typically I buy one of the Buffalo Blue varieties but I will admit when I am out and need to pick up a bag in a pinch I often get Beneful since I've been able to find it everywhere from grocery to convenient stores.  He seems to love the taste of this product.  Where as normally kibble sometimes sits around before he gets to it, this he does eat up right away.  So I guess I do get a certain amount of satisfaction in thinking he might actually enjoy eating his food.<br /><br />However there are a couple of observations I have made about this food.  The first is he seems to eat more of this food to feel satisfied.  Generally we free-feed at our house and I fill the bowl as it's empty (or as he clangs on it letting me know it is empty of food).  However I do feel like with this food I have to fill it twice as often.  It's hard to tell if it is because it is less nutritionally dense and therefore less satisfying or if he enjoys the flavor better and therefore wants more of it than he does with something like Buffalo Blue.<br /><br />The other thing I don't care for, personally, is the ingredients list.  It doesn't feel like the balance of protein to carbs is very high and the way ingredients are described I wonder about their quality.<br /><br />Overall this dog food is okay in a pinch, but not something I would personally choose to feed my dog longterm.",0
"i'm a big fan of poppycock caramel popcorn, but i don't eat them very much. in fact, i haven't had any in about a decade since the only sweet candy i regularly buy is 73% dark chocolate bars. since i was able to pick an item to review via the vine program, i figured i'd get some free caramel popcorn.<br /><br />i remember when the snackwell's big sell was being under 100 calories, but i guess 100 calories was too restrictive for the current american diet; therefore, the 100-calorie ceiling had to be broken. the best thing about these snackwell's is the ability to portion-control, even though the extra packaging is terrible for the environment. it's kind of sad that people aren't able to resist eating food which is super-engineered to be unnaturally yummy these days, myself included. oh well. anyway, i compared the nutritional value of this to the original poppycock popcorn, serving-per-serving.<br /><br />- one serving of snackwell's is 1.06oz, and one serving of poppycock is 1.1oz, though that could have been rounded up from 1.06oz. basically, they're about the same, but it's easy to eat more than 1/2 cup of poppycock when they come in the huge canister.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 130 calories, and poppycock has 160 calories. so that's good that the healthier version has lower calories.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 3g of fat, 2.5g as saturated. poppycock as 8g of fat, 2g as saturated. clearly, snackwell's has lower fat, but then poppycock also has nuts.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 190mg of sodium. poppycock has 90mg.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 24g of carbohydrates, 18g in sugars. poppycock has 20g of carbohydrates, 13g in sugar.<br /><br />this makes me conclude that this snackwell's item achieved its lower caloric content by reducing fat, but increasing sugar and salt to compensate for the lost fat. in a way, snackwell's would be worse for anyone in danger of developing diabetes, though such people shouldn't be consuming caramel popcorn. actually, no one should, but most of us like to indulge with food. the snackwell's is very light and crispy, but (though my memory of poppycock is distant), i wasn't blown away by the snackwell's like i was by poppycock. since the difference in calories between the two brands is only 30 calories, i would choose the poppycock which tastes better, has nuts, and has lower sugar and salt content. but most people will not be able to stop eating the poppycock after just 1/2 cup (1/1oz), so portion control for cravings is the genius concept behind snackwell's. if you're not disciplined or need to save 30 calories, then pick the snackwell's.<br /><br />btw, crunch n munch (another ConAgra brand) has similar nutritional content as poppycock. and no, i'm not a ConAgra representative. cracker jack also has similar nutritional content, though i was never a fan since it's not as crunchy.",0

"The ingredient list is fine on these, and they have a good texture but my almost 9 month old hates them. It is the only food she has tried so far that she refuses to eat every time I offer it. She eats green vegetables just fine but for some reason she hates these. I tasted them and they weren't terrible to me- a mixture of bitter and bland with no cheesy flavor that I could detect.",0
The first time I used this it kept my dog entertained for hours.  He figured out how to get the treat out of the ball so now it will keep him entertained for maybe 30 minutes.  Really expensive to keep buying these treats that distract him for such a short period of time now.,0
These are OK but not as flavorful as I like.  Maybe it's just me.  My son tried them and liked them but they are not hazel nutty as I like.  I'll try again -- maybe the 1st cup was a dud.,0
My dog loves this product and it didn't take him long to figure it out.  Which is the issue.  I don't really know if it works his brain much since he has it mastered...,0
I was primarily interested in just safron(yellow) rice rather than seasoned rice however this is the closest I could come to the real thing.,0
I'VE BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.  NOW WHEN I PUT THE K-CUP IN AND PUSH THE BUTTON ON I WILL ONLY GET A HALF OF A CUP.  FOR THE PRICE IT'S NOT WORTH IT.  I WOULDN'T BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.,0
My cat doesn't like this flavor but all cats have different tastes. The fancy feast brand is good and my cat likes several other flavors.,0

"This product is taste good, but i am worried about the saturated fat percentage! I would repeat buy this product if the maker reduces the fat.",0
"Nice enough, but simply not one of those brews that makes me sit back, sigh, and say, ""Now, THAT'S a cup of coffee!"" I'm not sure how to describe what makes me do that: it's sort of a rich, smoky bitterness without acidity. This coffee wasn't acidic, it just lacked that smoky bitterness that I'm after.",0
Each K-cup was good and what you would expect from Starbucks but you can get just as good quality with other name brands at half the cost. If Starbucks is your thing go for it but if you are just looking for a tasty cup of Joe in the morning try another brand,0
hit and miss on the flavors here.  but nice to try a sample pack and see what the family likes. maybe try in store first to see which flavors you might like.  very strongly flavored which is a plus.,0

That means I am still at the stage of buying two cans of something new to see how he reacts, before I invest in a case.  He wants to like this one, but seems to be turned off by the wheat gluten, and possibly the modified corn starch, within.

"I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.",0

"A very very strong candied cherry flavor, almost like the Cherry flavored Sucrets.  You probably would not eat Cherry flavored Sucrets on their own for dessert, but these Luxardo cherries cook very nicely in desserts.

The texture of the cherry is far superior to a normal store bought Maraschino cherry. Very firm.",0
"It is water, if you are looking for something with a high ph, this is it, but other than that I don't see much of a difference  than ordinary bottled water. It is a nice large size, something to put in the refrigerator and pour into a glass as needed. I wasn't to impressed with the water.",0
"These are decent Granola bars to give a try-out. There is not much chocolate flavor, to me it seemed more fiber and peanut butter oriented and that's leaves your mouth a dry after-taste.<br />One thing that annoyed me is that some peanut butter drops fall off. Just a pet peeve of mine but wanted to point it out for others like me. Dont see why they couldn't just make it a drizzle like the chocolate or inside the bar.<br /><br />Anyways, overall its got a decent taste and if your in the market for specifically a chocolate and peanut butter Granola bar, you can give this a try-out. Also one thing to consider is these are relatively high in fat for (10% daily sat. fat) and calories (110).",0

That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store. I see K Cups selling for $11.99 for a box of 24. I will keep watching to see if this price increase is temporary. If it isn't, my Subscribe and Save days are over.",0
"I was only provided with one single-serving (about a teaspoon of the mix) with which to review this product...not an easy task; I stopped by my local health food store to buy some additional product in order to be able to give better feedback. Doesn't taste fantastic, but is OK enough to accomplish hydration.<br />My overall impression is that it tastes like a fizzy G*torade...but a healthier version; actually, it is more like Alacer's Emergen-C products, which are available here on Amazon, as well, and can often be purchased at a less-expensive pricepoint.<br />The manufacturer's website states that EBOOST has:<br /><br />  * NO sugar<br />  * NO artificial colors<br />  * NO artificial flavors<br />  * NO high fructose corn syrup<br />  * NO crystalline fructose<br />  * NO soy<br />  * NO gluten<br />  * NO lactose<br /><br />The biggest concern is the overall cost...I would say it is worth a try if priced to be competitive with Alacer and other similar products.",0
I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat.,0
"The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients.",0
"I just received this product today and although I've been disappointed with K-Cups that weren't coffee or tea in the past (like hot cocoa and sweet tea) I figured I'd give these a shot since it was only $9.99 for 24.  I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink.  Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good.<br /><br />My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the ""bleh"" side.  The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet.  However, as I drank a little more it grew on me.  It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening.<br /><br />For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot.  Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though.",0
"I found this cereal so uninteresting that I almost forgot to review it, because I'd almost forgotten that I'd eaten it. It is not a bad cereal, just not memorable at all. With so many great cereals on the market, I don't see why this one is being offered. Just ignore this cereal and it will likely go away eventually.",0
"This food may be good for my cats, but two of my ragdolls, and these are large cats, will not eat the chunks because they are so large.",0
"Prince of Peace Peony White is better classified as a Shou Mei grade of tea. It forms a relatively dark brew in the cup, reminiscent of a green tea or perhaps an Oolong. Nevertheless, its taste is smooth and pleasing with little astringency. All in all, this a good deal on a decent cup of tea - but if you're looking for a true white tea, you should search elsewhere.",0
"I've been using gel a few years for running since they really are an important adjunct to the sport, but boy do they get old after awhile.  One of my coaches aptly described them as both ""essential"" and ""gross"".  Kilowatt for kilowatt, these blasts are more expensive and bulkier and do take more time (if that's a concern) to consume, but they don't leave you second-guessing your lifestyle either as they are ""yummier"" and more palatable.  A big downside is that they require way too much chewing, enough that it really interferes with my breathing trying to eat these while running.",0
"For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs ""Dessert of the Month.""  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: ""We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members."" Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting ""unrefrigerated,"" I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.",0
Amazon shipped this rapidly and the product arrived in good condition<br /><br />Pro:<br />The kippers are tasty.<br />Good value for money<br /><br />Cons<br />Kippers are small<br />The kippers are packaged with a lot of water.<br />The total amount of fish is less than from similar but higher priced products at Amazon,0
"I was waiting with higer expectations to this product, just before yesterday when it was delievered.<br />I expected the taste would be sweet and rich-cocoa since they are saying it is cocoa roasting almonds, but it's just slightly rosted with cocoa. once I taste it, I was pretty disappointed.<br />it's just not only real almonds's taste, but also not strong cocoa's taste. also, they are very dry. that's why it's easy to be cracked.<br />anyway, if I knew it's just weak taste of cocoa, i would just bought the raw ones for rich and fresh taste.",0
"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",0
"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order.",0
"Picked these up on a whim because I love healthy snacks. I wish they were organic, though. The texture is not what I expected - I was expecting the dense, smooth texture of the more common corn puffs. These are crunchier, and the flavor is very mild. I imagine they would be great for kids, but I won't be picking them up again for the high price.",0
"I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one.",0
I know that brown rice takes longer to cook so I was shocked when the box called for letting the rice simmer for 25 minutes.  I let mine simmer for 35 and fixed 2 kiddie plates before I tasted the crunchy mess.  I set the timer for 20 more minutes and put the lid back on..it did soften up a bit but I make my brown rice to be almost as soft as white rice.  Maybe next time I will try making this in my rice cooker since it does a beautiful job on plain brown rice.  The flavor was really good on it though.  Just cooking time was the problem.,0
"I bought this because i am a loyal Merrick fan (especially their bone products) and because i was spending so much for raw hides at Petsmart.<br /><br />This is an excellent deal and i will still stay true to Merrick but unfortunately these are just not good for my 7 month Labrador Retrievers sensitive tummy.<br /><br />She LOVES these to death!!!<br /><br />I have the box in our pantry and she knows when i go in to get one for her she just follows me with a wagging tail. She will chew on it until there is nothing left but when it comes for potty time her stools are totally loose.<br /><br />It took a little while to realize what was up and after a visit to the vet he asked if i was doing anything different, changed her food suddenly, odd/different behavioral issues, picking and eating stuff from the floor, feeding from the table, etc....And since we ruled all that out i started monitoring it until i figured out it was these raw hides.<br /><br />We are both heartbroken but health is more important than anything else for me. I am not saying there is anything wrong with this product because i honestly don't believe there is but Labrador Retrievers are known for their sensitive stomachs and that is all.<br /><br />I would definitely have bought these again if my little girl wouldn't have had an issue with them. I will definitely recommend them!",0
"I like the taste of this broth. As a longtime vegetarian, I cannot say how much it tastes like chicken, as I haven't had chicken in decades. I really don't care if it tastes like chicken, I just like a variety of vegetarian flavors. This flavor could be called ""yellow"" (and Frontier's beef flavored broth could be called ""brown""), it still tastes good to me. This is a quick, savory broth mix, that satisfies an urge for something hot and salty. I liked this and was going to buy more until I checked the nutritional stats. If you aren't too concerned about nutritional value, you may like it too.<br /><br />But the salt is the problem. I use about 2.66 tablespoons of broth powder (2 Tbs + 2 tsps) to make a cup of about 10 ounces of broth. It comes to 1400 mg of sodium. I am not on a low sodium diet, but I keep track, and my daily allotment of healthy sodium intake is 2300 mg (based on a 2000 calorie a day diet). So one bowl of this broth uses more than half (60%) a whole day's worth of salt!<br /><br />It also has 4 grams of sugar in the above described serving. My 10 ounce bowl has almost no other nutritional value, no vitamins, no protein, and 80 calories. For me, this is not a food that should be a pantry staple, it just isn't nutritionally worth consuming. I'd really worry about giving this regularly to anyone with high blood pressure concerns.<br /><br />This broth is good, but not so good I can't give it up for healthier choices. It could be an occasional treat, but it really isn't great enough to be a splurge food. I'd rather indulge in pizza or nachos once in a while and otherwise eat lower salt foods.",0
I recieved the Mcvities biscuts in the mail and was surprised to see the ingredients werent written in english and there was an Arab due by date. This is a product supposedly made in Britain. Im uncomfortable to say the least about this. SO its nly getting 3 stars from me.,0
"After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyone's tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.<br /><br />I found that the tablets didn't make things ""sweet"" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. I'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.<br /><br />Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity/citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.<br /><br />I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good).",0
"I Drink only water that has been ""purified""..ie: water that does not come from tap..I relized that the water coming form my tap tasted acceptable ,,it still tasted funny.Then I found out all the ""stuff"" they were putting in the public water and I endevered not to drink it UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO.Now I do have my own water purification stuff but I do like to have a good supply of purified water in bottles for my family,mainly for emergency plan supplies.Anyway I have tried many different kinds and this is what I have found...Fiji water is ok..but somehow the so called artesian water tastes funny...so i am not ordering it again..It tastes kind of ""slimy in a way..Silica in this Fiji water I guess is not a good thing.My opinion is that the ""Smartwater"" brand is just that,,good clean tasting water..Plus it is less expensive than the Fiji water.So....again this just being my opinion..go get yourself the Smartwater.I do not think you will be disappointed in your choice.I would buy it from the local Wal-Mart or some other grocery or local store if they had it but I am disabled and cannot leave the home ,seeing as i can not walk very well.",0
"This is okay for what it is and if you don't like plain water, but it tastes too fake to me.  It's just full of chemicals and the peach and manga flavor doesn't come across. I just taste sweet.  Really, it kind of defeats the purpose of drinking water if you put this in it....",0
I was a little disappointed with the tea.  The taste of the pumpkin spice that I enjoy so much in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice lattes was sadly not the same.,0
"I can't say I'm all that crazy bout this flavor. It tastes a bit flowery and not tangy at all.<br /><br />I like that it has no high-fructose corn syrup and supposedly less sugar. It's also very easy to mix into water and to make it less sweet by using less powder as well.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of mango and peach, this may just be the Kool Aid for you.",0

"The package arrive with the seals broken, but in a plastic sealed bag, so kinda strange... there were 50 in there, and expires March 2013, so good that way too.<br />Tried it, its probably the best instant coffee I have tasted... BUT to those who think it tastes like the store coffee at Starbucks (which I do like very much), I am not understanding what those people are drinking...<br />If I rated it against other instant coffe, it 4.5 stars, if I rated it against Starbucks coffee at the store, its a 2 star. So I gave it 3 based on vs. other coffee, but being more expensive.  its maybe about as good as a Kurig coffee or passable, for comparison.  That being said, I like great coffee... most coffee at the supermarket is is swill.",0
"I loved eating this doughnuts when I was a freshman in high school. I cannot really find them anywhere except if I go to Sam's Club. However, I do not have a membership card to buy anything there. I want to get these doughnuts but if I have to spend over $20 for the item, forget it.",0
"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.",0
"The spices in this product have a wonderful fragrance that wafts up at you when you open the package. It is also very convenient. Downsides are that it is very salty, and the vegetables are, well, canned vegetables -- what more can I say?",0
"First order contained over half severely damaged cans, and the product was not tomatoes with basil. Amazon replaced the first shipment, and the second had three damaged cans. Once again the product I received is 50% water and tomatoes. No basil, as described.",0
"All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.",0
"We usually feed our dog the High Prairie version of Taste of the Wild but we sometime like to buy a bag of a different version of TOTW (Wetlands or Pacific Stream) to provide him with some variety. Whenever we change foods we are sure to mix the two formulas for a few days to avoid an upset stomach, and while this works with the Wetlands version it has not with the Pacific Stream food which doesn't seem to agree with our dog too well.  He loves the flavor, but when we give him the Pacific Stream formula we notice that he tends to have bad breath with strong hints of fish and that he to get loose stools.<br /><br />While we think that Taste of the Wild is outstanding food, the Pacific Stream formula is not for us and we will stick with their High Plains version with the occasional bag of Wild Fowl to mix it up.",0
"I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.",0
"Red&White tastes exactly like plain rooibos, which was slightly disappointing since I was expecting something more exotic, thanks to the tea's name. Nonetheless, it's a decent rooibos tea with strong flavor.",0
The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking....,0
"I got this NOW virgin coconut oil when my usual brand (Tree of Life) was not available.  Comparing the two, NOW is more gritty and not as smooth (in solid state) as ToL. Now also has more of a coconut flavor.  Both are fine for cooking, adding to smoothies, using on skin, and eating from the jar, I guess it just depends on personal preference. Both products are good for you and backed by well respected companies. I personally like ToL better.",0

i ordered this based on my experience with the sweet potato bags. i thought the combo would be better. but the krinkle kind fails in comparison to the normal seet potato because they are a lot more oily and they are burned with a burned taste,0
"I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.",0
"At the time of ordering, description did not mention refrigeration necessary.  I'd thought this was a glass ""canned"" jar of jam, similar to fruit jams that do not need refrigeration until opened.  It arrived fine, but I didn't open right away.  The freezer-pack in box gave away the issue.  The box was not labeled perishable.  I would NOT order this online again.",0
"My title says it all. The cats all like treats, and they ate this bag, but then didn't go crazy for it. So it would depend on the price whether I bought it or not.",0

"I think the medium roast is the best tasting espresso I've ever had.  However it gives me acid reflux about half an hour after I drink it.  I've only had this happen once before, with another brand of lightly roasted espresso.  I tried the espresso a couple of times, hoping that something else was causing the reflux, but alas it was this yummy espresso.  I really prefer the medium roast to the dark roast, but I had to go back to my organic beans (and my reflux went away).  But if reflux is not a problem for you, this stuff is really great.  Although it didn't taste as good the second day as it did the first day.  I guess that happens with all coffee though, which is why many people grind their own.",0

OK grocery stores do sell pet food, ok, I get it, but for sanity's sake make a section just for pet food that is separate from the human food. I'm aware times are tough, but come on! Granted, most of the typical store brands of tuna are not much fitter for human consumption than cat food, but I'm searching for the high end salmon and tuna, AMAZON! YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG, STOP!<br /><br />I've fed fancy feast to various pets over the years and it is very acceptable.",0

"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",0
"I normally love this product - 5 stars - but in this shipment the bars were all hard like a rock. I wonder if it had been stored improperly prior to shipment. Still tasted great, but not the soft like the KIND bars I buy in the store.",0
"I bought this product for my mom who has had a violent cough accompanied by phlegm for 10+ years.  She has been told she has acid reflux.  She's tried many drugs and remedies but nothing has eliminated her coughing.  I told her to take 1 tsp/day of Manuka honey and see what happens.  It's been about 3 weeks and she says her cough seems to be getting better but she was taking Prilosec for part of that time so she's not sure if the honey or the drug is working.  Now, she has stopped the Prilosec, and is only taking this product.  Her coughing bouts are much less than they were so it appears that this product is definitely helping.  We're very optimistic.  I would say it's definitely worth a try for acid reflux.",0

"Very easy to fix with a can of tomatoes and some chicken, pork or shrimp.  The seasonings are flavorful and the rice cooks up nicely, unlike instant rice which has an odd extruded look and feel.  It is quite salty though - more salty than I like.  I have been using sodium free tomatoes and, of course, not salting the water.  I will eat the boxes I have but will not order more due to the excessive salty taste.",0
"I bought these to share with a friend who loved Starburst. One bag would have been enough! I'm not sure if it's something to do with humidity or not but after awhile they seemed to get harder and harder. I kept the bag closed and in a dark place, not sure what happened. It wasn't a Warehouse Deals purchase. If you're looking to buy these in bulk to save throughout the year I'd advise against it just because the harder they get the more difficult (for candy) they get to eat and you enjoy them less.",0
"I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y"" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).",0
"This soup taste OK, better than most.  But, it is very high calorie. I should have guessed, since it uses real cream.  I will try another brand next time.",0
"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",0
"a decent drink, but certainly not as strongly-flavored as it could be. i don't enjoy an overly-spicy chai, but this is bordering on steamed milk with a hint of chai flavoring. i've tried pressing the button after brewing the tea to make a bit more more chai, but i think it will take a bit of trial-and-error before getting enough flavor out of the tea disc (if that's even possible).<br /><br />despite the lack of flavor, it's still a good drink for sipping. if they could just add some more kick, this could easily be five stars. the milk comes out great and foamy, and it's got the sweetness i like.",0
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.,0
"I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)",0
"I like Amy's products in general and these taste fine. although I like a heartier texture. At $2.27 per can (and that's on sale) I think the product is too expensive. It's so easy to make refried beans at home by frying and mashing a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans in a cast iron frying pan (use a little vegetable oil to fry then mash with a potato masher, adding bottled salsa to thin the mix and a pinch of cumin and chili powder for flavor). I'm all for encouraging sales of products made with organic ingredients, but beans are too basic to spend so much money on, imho.",0
My dogs love these as treats but maintaining them with their Kong is kind of a pain.  The dogs will immediately chew of the portion outside of the Kong leaving the remainder of the biscuit to rattle around inside.  They soon tire of trying to get the partial treat out and it is up to me to remove it.,0
"This is one of my wife's favorite candies.  Unfortunately, it arrived on a very hot day and by the time we brought it inside, each packet was melted together.  We just threw it away.  Maybe we'll try again in cooler weather.",0
"I like that these packages are just the right size for 1-2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!",0
These chips remind me of regular Fritos. I like the other flavor better then this one the sweet chile but some people may not like the spicey flavor my sister for one !,0
I don't get why they are so expensive on Amazon. Either way these are kind of gross. Enjoy!,0
"The coffees came packaged in a plain brown box; none were broken.  I received 40 cups, but only 38 different varieties (could have been worse).

It may just be a mistake in my part but.. under the product description it says the product dimensions are 6x2x9 inches.. this is the packaging not the treat itself... if I would have known how small the actual treats are they would not... and are not...worth the cost... Don't waste your money.,0
"So, if you look really closely at the picture of the product, it does say small dogs under the name.  However, it doesn't specify that in the amazon description, which I think is lame.  Suffice to say, these little 3 or so inch diameter patties will not function as anything but the world's most expensive bag of dog treats for my 100 lb. dog.  Had purchased these hoping for lightweight, packable dog food for backpacking that could be rehydrated, but this won't do it. The product itself seems fine if you've got a small dog; it is the lack of proper description that leads to my mediocre review.",0
"This was alright. My dog destroyed the tennis balls on the rope in about ten minutes. The frisbee is very fun. The three games are ok, just kind of boring. I guess it could be fun for a puppy or an older dog, but my dog only took about 3 seconds to find the treats.",0
"These were decent, but a lot of the blue skins of the blueberries were just blue powder in the package after they came of the berries and got crunched up during shipping etc. They were nice and crunchy with decent flavor for freeze dried berries.",0
"I tried the cappuccino one as well, and I like that one better. This one is good, but tastes more like iced black coffee with no sugar/cream. So if that's your preference (you prefer it black or like to add your own sweetener/cream), then this is for you.<br /><br />I could still drink it, but definitely prefer it with a little extra cream in there.",0
"It was a little drier than when I first tasted this.<br />Maybe past its prime.<br /><br />Flavor was fine though, I like this minty dark chocolate-ness.<br />Like a healthy Girl Scout Thin Mint>",0
"I ordered 4 bags of this coffee when it was on special..I noticed upon my first cup that it has a very distinct taste..the verdict is still out since I am only on about cup number 10...at first I thought no way am I gonna consume this stuff...but after a few cups now,its not too bad...hehe...I just made a cup and noticed the smell/taste when it was brewing,don't know if its a manure smell or what..maybe someone else is better at identifying smells..(I am not)..but I can smell very good....take a chance you may like it,and who knows after 4 bags I may be HOOKED?",0
"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness.  A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste.  I would not purchase them again.  I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness.  Also the sticks get very hard.",0
"Couldn't wait to taste this coffee.  Once it arrived,  I immediately brewed me a cup. The smell was just like chocolate but the taste of chocolate wasn't really there. It's O.k.",0
My cat does not seem crazy about it and I don't blame her.... man it smells like dog poo. I am always wary of food which is mashed to the point of being unrecognizable. There are no chunks of meat or vegetables. My cat and I will have to live thru finishing the 24 cans I bought. I will be cancelling my subscription.,0
"I heard all about red palm oil from an Underground Wellness blog-radio show. It sounded really healthy with all the antioxidant and Vitamin E tocotrienols, so I decided to give it a try.<br />Here is first experience with red palm oil:<br /><br />The oil looked somewhat like a more viscous tomato paste and then the smell hit me. It didn't smell like something I wanted to eat. I tasted a little bit and found it to be an indescribably bad taste - somewhat like when you throw up a little bit in your mouth. I kept an open mind and used it to cook some everyday items like meat and eggs. The oil smoked almost right away over heat. I was rather disappointed in that, but someone else said they experienced the same thing and that it's not supposed to do that. The food I made with it gained the flavor of the palm oil, unfortunately, and it was rather strong.<br /><br />I'm thinking that when you use it, you need to put it in dishes that will overpower it with strong spices and other flavors. If anybody has any suggestions on complimentary cuisine, I'd appreciate it. I still think the health benefits outweigh the bad taste, so I want to keep using it - just sparingly and in dishes that overpower it.",0
My dog is small and loves loves treats. But treats she can toss in the air and run around with. She couldn't get the idea this was just a taste. She really thought at some point I would give up and give her the bottle. I am passing it on to a friend who is trying to train her dog not to pull on the leash. I realize this is a training tool but my dog didn't seem to think so. She did like the taste.,0
"It's a good bargain for $14 dollars a pound! But it's just your regular old jerky. No taste or anything, just your regular meat--regular jerky, you just get more bang for your buck!",0
Had been receiving this coffee for one year as a standing order from Amazon. Price was steady until October. Won't buy again due to exorbitant pricing practices.,0
"was surprised that all 4 cans were NOT all banana.  there was 1 banana, 1 blueberry, 1 cinammon apple, & 1 homestyle.  i made the banana this morning, and a double batter made only 3 Belgin waffles.  they were good, but not as good as scratch.  i would not likley buy again.  it was very easy to make ( as compared with scratch), but was not as good as i had expected.",0
"Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!",0
"More than a ""hint"" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK.",0
"I love Coconut and the flavor is really good, but it was much sweeter than expected. I like to have a healthy mid morning snack at work and this is just a little too much to serve that purpose. I have enjoyed having one before a workout to get some extra energy but I won't be buying these on a regular basis.",0
"This granola is quite tasty for a snack right out of the bag. It has a nice oaty flavor with just a hint of coconut. Every once in awhile you find a chunk of chocolate or a freeze-dried berry. If you're eating it as a cereal with milk, you can slice fresh strawberries into it to boost the fruitiness, but as is the dominant flavor is mostly oats. The chunks of dark chocolate are delicious.<br /><br />I wanted to try this granola just because it sounded yummy, but it can be healthful too, if you control your portions. It's fairly low in sugar. The bag says only 6 grams of sugar in 1/4 cup, which is hard to believe, but it really is a lot less sweet than other granolas I've bought. There are 140 calories and 6 grams of fat in 1/4 cup, which is not low fat, but neither is it excessive. In that serving you also get 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein, thanks to the whole grains and the addition of flax seeds, which also provide some omega-3s. All ingredients are certified organic and non-GMO.<br /><br />Overall a good, wholesome-tasting granola, if you don't mind the infrequency of berries and chocolate.",0
"Any additional health value gained from the vegetables added to this product is countered by a high sodium (550 mg) and high calorie cound (370 calories).  It's prepackaged food so you don't exactly expect it to be healthy, but if you are going to market your product as healthy then you should be taken to task for it when it is not.  Insofar as other health benefits, it includes 15% USDA recommended amount of Vitamin A and C, but your kids are probably already getting that and then some from their morning breakfast cereal.<br /><br />It tasted fine and was easy to prepare, which is what you expect from pre-packaged food.  It is what it is, a quick side dish for when you are in a hurry.  But a healthy way to sneak veggies into the family's meals?  Not so much.",0
"This bread baked fine in my bread machine and rose well, but it was a letdown when it came to flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad; in fact it was good, but not any better than store-bought bread. I ended up giving the birds half the loaf and won't be purchasing this again. My quest to find a good rye bread mix that's as good as the deli rye I used to buy continues...",0
i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards,0
"These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor-wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.  The price on the Albanese sugar plums is reasonable, the flavor is good and it's always nice to support a small, independent candymaker!",0
"Recently ordered some Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-cups and found the coffee to be only okay, not great.  There is very little hazelnut flavor and the coffee is on the bitter side.  Will finish this order but will not re-order this brand.",0
"My two Golden Retrievers like these a lot, but they are expensive and they disappear very quickly.  I prefer chews that last longer.",0
I don't know why this product received so many 5 star reviews.  I would rate this somewhere between Folgers and Rocamojo Coffee (one of the better coffee beans that you can buy on Amazon).  It is about half the price of Rocamojo coffee but it is also twice as expensive as Folgers.  Does it taste 2x better than Folgers? No.  Is it 50% as good as Rocamojo? Yes.,0
"I ordered ""Super Antioxidant"" Naked treats last week.  Both my dogs love them.  It's the only treat I've found so far that our dog with part of his lower jaw removed, due to oral melanoma, can and will chew.  The problem is that I now see that the treats contain ""carrageenan"".  Now, I will have to find another dog (or trash can) to give the treats to.  I just ordered two more bags  today.  Although common in many foods, carrageenan is supposedly a carcinogen, per healthyeatingadvisor.com.  I've read from other sources that carrageenan can cause stomach problems.  If my dog had not already suffered from oral melanoma cancer, I might not be concerned.  But, I figure why take any chances.  Per notmilk.com, it's not the seaweed that's the problem, it's the processing to turn it into carrageenan.  Just like with things like Nutrasweet, etc.  Maybe this company uses a safe process.  I'll skip giving it to my dogs, until I know for sure.  Wow, shopping for dog food gets complicated!",0
The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.,0
I purchased this sampler mainly because it advertised apple cider and hot cocoa. My package did not contain either. Maybe there is a disclaimer in there? Oh well...,0
"I would never retract that the product seems to be excellent for our pet... and she really enjoys them.  I guess my now somewhat jaded view of the firm itself is from the fact that we did purchase a bag that was indeed problematic for our dog.  After incurring over $1,300 in vet bills to discover that base cause was that new bag of Virbac Chewies... Our contact with Virbac was friendly from a customer service standpoint... but the net result was not one dollar of help toward the .. for us... rather substantial vet bill. It seemed to be a management attitude of .... ""there is no way our product could have had anything to do with the spewing diarhea.... so just go away""<br />Needless to say... we will find an alternative to Virbac in the future...<br /><br />It's really a shame... because before that bag and since... there has been no problem.  However.... as a small business owner... I cannot support a firm that has such a black and white attitude toward such matters.",0
"On the one hand, this tiny corn-flour shell pasta has a pleasant flavor that offset a sub-par cheese sauce recipe.  On the other, it never completely cooked.  I left it on the fire for the defined time, tasted it, and found it underdone.  So I gave it more time, and it was still underdone.<br /><br />In the end I gave it nearly twice the prescribed time before just giving up and eating it.  At that point it tasted good, but was gummy and undercooked, and when I drained it the cook-water was almost rigid with starch.  I could have used that water to glue stuff in my scrapbook.<br /><br />It was tasty enough.  But it took too long and never got finished.  I've had good luck with this brand before, if not this exact variety, so I may try again when I have more time to invest.  But for the moment, I could kindly call this product a mixed bag.",0
"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.",0
this is my fav Jerkey of all time..and when i recived mine it was moist and not good..the jerky still had white fat visable on the jerky it was so moist it was sticky..if you now this brand u know thats not how its supposed to be..i even threw out 2 bags it was that bad..idk y or how it happened but i wont buy it online ever again..Gl,0
"This kind of tastes like ice cream.  Unfortunately the similarities end there.<br /><br />The creamy texture that makes REAL ice cream feel good in your mouth must have been sucked out of the package along with the moisture back at the factory.<br /><br />Biting down on this stuff is like biting into a hardened piece of neopolitan-flavored insulating foam.  I found it to be a pretty gross sensation and had a hard time finishing the bar.<br /><br />Still, it's worth trying once!",0
"The added grains make these a better choice than the usual chips. They have the same sugar, salt and oil so there are better food snack choices out there, if you care about your health. If they had been made with organic ingredients I might have given them another star. I doubt I would ever purchase this item. Snacks like this are expensive and with food prices going up it has to be really special to make it into the cart.",0
"My neutral review is based in part on that, as a Vine reviewer who was provided with a single packet, I could not conduct any extended text of the product, or see if it delivered any particular benefits.<br /><br />Overall, the ingredients are similar to those in many vitamin supplements. The flavour is pleasing, but, since one packet contains four grams of sugar, those who need to be careful of sugar/carbohydrate intake might prefer a vitamin tablet. I would say that this is a typical vitamin product, with no particular pros and cons.",0
The food keeps my dog super healthy; I believe it is the best. Was not happy the bag was ripped in transit or the fact that  I was forced to buy the bigger bag because the smaller one was not significantly less money. My dog weighs 5lbs so a bag this size takes her 6 months to eat.,0
"Although I got them for a great price I won't be ordering this again from Amazon. I got 4 boxes of honey bunches of oats with strawberries but I'm guessing due to so much travel, by the time they got to me, the cereal was in pretty small pieces. All flakes had been broken down, and the granola wasn't in much chunks either. It was ok to eat, but is better not shaken so much.",0
"Naturally, pooch scarfed this up.  What's not to like, other than it costs a bit more than the fake processed junk you normally get on the store shelf.",0
"Let me start by saying that the seller did an excellent job of packaging the case with not one dented can and it arrived quickly. My cat refused to eat the Purina NF and Hills K/D sold at my vet's office and was willing to starve himself if that was all he was offered. I read many reviews on other sites prior to purchasing and located a site where you can order individual cans. Great as a trial in case my cat refused to eat it. However, that site sent me 6 cans of the old formula and 6 cans of the new formula.  Being new to this brand, I turned to the internet to figure out what had changed. Apparently, the ingredient listings have not been updated for the new formula, even on the manufacter's site.  The new formula lists beef as the primary meat ingredient.<br /><br />My two cats including one that does not have kidney problems were initially enjoying the food, licking their plates clean with a distinct preference towards what turned out to be the old formula. I thought finally I had found a kidney diet that wouldn't end up in the trash. By the time I received the shipment, the attraction had worn off. One of my cats vigorously claws at the floor in an attempt to cover the food dish and the other (diagnosed with kidney disease) runs from the bowl after a few bites. They have gone back to eating regular food for now.  However, I am going to try and mix the more enticing food into the Hi-Tor before I completely give up on it and request a refund, and continue my search.  My local humane society does not retain ""special needs"" cats or dogs so donating it is out.  On the bright side, this seller has a 30 day return policy.",0
"The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.",0
"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",0
This was less sugar than I was expecting. 4 oz is barely enough for rolling one batch of cookies.,0

"The ""experts"" say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's ""Wake-Up Call"". ""Dark Magic"" has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!",0
"I just bought myself a bag of these shrimp chips from a local market.  I grew up with these and enjoy them a lot.  Thought I would try to save some money by buying them in bulk through Amazon.  Good deal but having just had a bag of these, I could immediately distinguish a blandness of taste in comparison.  Still the same good shrimp flavor but only about half as strong as the bag I got locally.  Not sure if it's maybe because the ones from Amazon aren't as fresh.  The 12 pack I received have an expiration date of Aug 2011.  I didn't think to check the expiration on the bag I bought locally.<br /><br />How I'm going to eat 12 bags of these by Aug 2011 I have no idea.  And I worry I might actually succeed!",0
"As cereals go, there are plenty of choices. I tend to favor plainer ones myself, so the sweetness of the honey taste wasn't the plus for me it might be for someone else. Still, it was not bad. The bits of peanut added an extra tang. The overall effect reminded me of a cross between frosted flakes and Cracker Jacks.<br /><br />As an experiment, I used up the rest of the box by turning it into an impromptu snack bar mix. I melted some marshmallows with a bit of butter over low heat, and stirred in the cereal. (One cup of marshmallows to every 2 cups of cereal). I then took the mix and spread it onto a buttered baking sheet, packing it together. When cooled, I sliced it up into handy-sized servings. The result was tasty, crunchy and a bit more portable.<br /><br />If I were to try the experiment again, I might crunch the flakes down a bit more before mixing in the marshmallows, and try adding things like chocolate chips, butterscotch bits, raisins, craisins (dried cranberry snacks) or combinations of them all.",0
"I liked the taste and it was not hard to make but the Chreese had a terrible consistency.  It was thick and gloppy - not at all like a smooth sauce.  I made it three times with the same result.  It's possible I'm doing something wrong, but I believe I am following the directions to a T.<br />That being said, it does taste really good and definitely satisfies a cheese craving.  I will continue to use it, but probably won't serve it to guests until I can figure out the consistency issues.",0
"I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, ""hey that happens, no big deal..."" A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, ""hey that happens, it's hot out..."" But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, ""hey these are really salty"" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.",0

Great coffee but not worth more than a dollar a cup.<br />Be careful Amazon gets what the traffic will support.<br />Their price fluctuates.  Try Bed Bath & Beyond.,0
"First let me say that my cats only like two flavors.  The tuna and salmon.  The ingredients are pretty good and seem nutritious.  One problem is the amount of water.  If you drain out the water, you're left with about a heaping tablespoon of food.  This is barely enough for one cat.  I have to supplement it with some dry food.  When I feed them something like Spa Select, it is so concentrated that I can give them half a can each.  So moneywise, I can give them the higher quality food for the same amount as the meow mix.<br />The second issue is the tiny bones.  I have to always look through the food before I give it to them.  When I wrote to the company they basically wrote back saying, hey stuff happens, here's a coupon.",0
"Out of the 5 flavors in the box, I only really liked one.  The others were so-so.  Luckily, people at work were willing to eat what I didn't want.  I bought these willing to try something new, but next time, I think I will just stick with the classic flavors because you just can't go wrong there!",0
Don't get fooled by the easy-to-use look of this product.,0
These individual pre-measured coffee packs work great in the Solofill and ekobrew.<br />The Grind seems perfect and brewed a decent cup of coffee in my Keurig B70 on the 8oz cup size.<br />Getting coffee with the perfect grind to work in the solofill & ekobrew is a challenge unless you have a good burr grinder so this is a really convenient alternative.<br />I'm more of a dark roast extra bold Kcup drinker and this is a much lighter roast than I prefer.<br />The Flavor I would rate as average but nothing special.<br />reminded my of the average ground coffee you find on grocery store shelfs.<br />Amazon had it priced really low so I gave it a try and it serves its purpoes well at that price point.,0

"I have cooked pastas for more years than I care to tell and I've never experienced anything quite like this. True to Italian pasta, this product keeps its al dente quality but cracks and falls apart into many pieces along the ridges. I cooked a second bag to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but it happened again. This is a nice tasting pasta, which is the reason I gave it three stars, but it defeats the whole purpose of rigatoni (at least in my recipes). I wish I could believe the post office just handled this package roughly, but I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. Has anyone else had this problem?",0
"Need a mojito fix in the middle of the day? Want to waste away to another place while at work? Well, Crystal Light's new Mocktails Mojito might be just what you're looking for. Obviously, these are non-alcoholic, but I figure I might as well put that in here (just in case someone asks). The Mojito flavor was way stronger than I expected and I am not much of a fan of the overwhelming ""minty-ness"".  However, if you like mojitos, take a break from the ordinary, try out Crystal Light Mocktails.

"I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.",0
"This is a good tasting orange marmalade but does not really have the taste of blood oranges.  So if you are expecting an unique flavor like eating a blood orange, forget it.  For a standard orange marmalade, it is good however.  The company should sell it in larger jars rather than 3.5 ounce bottles, like those small ones a restaurant puts on your table.",0
"There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.",0
"The flavor of this Crystal Light is light and citrusy and is a bright neon green color.  Would be great if you are making a halloween punch and wanted something that looked radioactive.  I don't mind the flavor but if you are expecting a non-alcoholic version of a margarita you will be disappointed.  That being said, it is refreshing and very low calorie.  I would recommend it and gave it three stars instead of more because it doesn't come close to the flavor it claims to be.",0
"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!",0

"I don't want to say that this is a bad product, because some people may enjoy this. Since it was fruit, I was expecting a taste more sweet than it is. That being said, all it contains is dried fruit, so there isn't any added sugar, just the natural fruit sugar. I prefer the raisins over the mixed fruit. The fruit selection was varied, and some fruits tasted better than others. They do have a long shelf life, so if you want fruit that lasts a long time (what I was looking for), this is the product to get.",0
"ADVANTAGES:  (1)Although Vigo sells its squid in tiny 4-ounce cans, these cans are fully packed with squid meat so the quantity of squid meat per can is actually not as inadequate as it might seem at first.  (2)The chunks of squid are of high quality and taste very good.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Some people would classify the easy-open lid as an advantage but I feel that it is a slight disadvantage because of the risk of splattering the contents all over the floor, table, or countertop.  (2)The biggest disadvantage is that soybean oil is added to make it taste better.  This increases the calories and decreases the healthfulness.  Walmart sells Flower brand A1 Seasoned Cuttle Fish in large 6.5-ounce cans for only $2.03 each.  Sugar, salt, and soy sauce are added but no vegetable oil is added and the taste of the soft, A1 squid meat is adequately good and the calories are substantially lower.",0
"I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and ""prefer"" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, I'm sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Can't do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess.",0

"I like the fact that this tea is organic, but compared to the taste of Ito-en's Oolong shots (which are not organic, unfortunately), the Anteadote teas lack a freshness and purity that the Ito-en has. Too bad. I'd like to have organic + great tasting tea with no sugar. Will keep looking.",0
"I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband has a travel cup attached to his hand. This is his review:<br /><br />The coffee was okay.

"I bought the ""natural"" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.

Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety.",0
"The idea is a good one. Who doesn't want to reminisce about their childhood when they were free and innocent?! But the price is a bit steep and the products aren't that impressive. Many of these items can be found in certain grocery or candy stores, and for a fraction of the price. It would be much more impressive and tantalizing if there were items that you can't find regularly. I would like to see one with old favorites such as dweebs, bonkers, gatorgum or bar none (to name a few). Bring back those and you can charge me any price you want!!!",0

"I needed powdered espresso for some Maida Heater's cake recipes and purchased this one.  Brings back memories of my parents' instant coffee habits of the 1960s--when so much food and drink was ersatz.

I don't usually put milk or half and half in my coffee but this is hard to take black.",0
"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.",0
"These were ok, but they could have used more cinnamon flavor.

"Milka is one of the top chocolatiers in Germany. So I was really excited to find out that they are making T-disc now as well.<br />Unfortunately I must say, that this excitement has been replaced by a kind of sober disappointment.<br />Yes, the taste is good, although a bit too sweet - I still prefer the hot chocolate from Suchard (one of the top Swiss chocolatiers ...).<br />But what really annoys the heck out of me is that you actually need two syrup discs and two milk discs to get the same amount of liquid as with the Suchard discs. In other words - there is only half as much stuff in there.<br />So either you use smaller cups (which I refuse ... I am a big man and need a big mug), or you spend twice the amount of discs to fill the usual mug. Annoying.<br />I will not buy this ever again, the Suchard stuff fits my needs much better.",0
"I looked deeper into the description of these and found this:<br /><br />***ZICO 11 oz. tetra cartons are produced in Brazil and deliver a light, refreshing taste.<br /><br />One-liter cartons are produced in Thailand for a more nutty flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.<br /><br />And 14 oz. bottles are a nutty blend of Brazilian, Thai and Indonesian coconuts.***<br /><br />So you might not be liking the taste of the coconuts from Thai and Indonesia instead of it being the plastic bottle.<br /><br />I'll be staying with the original formula since I bought some from Trader Joe's and really like it but it is the Brazilian coconuts only.<br /><br />Mystery solved?  Let me know what you think.",0
"This canned roast beef is as would be expected for a canned meat, and was a decent value as offered through Amazon's ""subscribe and save"" option.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product, along with Post Cranberry-almond cereal, and several other items to which we have tried to ""subscribe"", are unceremoniously withdrawn from being available, often after a very short time, never to return.<br /><br />This procedure makes a mockery of the ""Subscribe"" portion of this Amazon feature. The good news is, I guess, that one does save 15% off the Amazon list price for at least one order.<br /><br />Hopefully, Amazon will be able to get longer term deals with suppliers, or change their in-house policies, to allow the ""Subscribe"" offer to be real.",0
"I've read the reviews and I should have probably listened. When I received my product I noticed right away that some were opened as the cereal was filling on the sides of the box. They were orderly cramped in, but the lids on 18 of those were half-way opened. After checking to see what and how many of each, I counted 12 Raisins w/ Granola, 11 Smartstarts Original, 11 Special K Fruit & Yogurt, 14 Special K Red berries, and 8 Special K Original cereal which in grand total added to 56 cups, NOT the 60 as advertised. I probably won't order this again unless Kellogg's can get their act together when distributing through Amazon.<br /><br />3 stars as the cereal does taste great, especially the Red berries",0

"they changed their packaging and stuff in the last year and it appears they've tweaked the recipe as well. They used to be sweeter, very cardboard like now.

"Tried the coffee and liked the aroma and flavor, but the manufacturing of the K cup needs improvement.

"I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage.",0

"I usually eat cereal for breakfast 4 out of 7 days a week, so I was happy to have an opportunity to try this new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't really float my boat.  It was far too sweet, with no discernable ""nut"" flavor at all.  I mean, I could *see* the little flecks of what I assume are nuts stuck to the ""o""s, but any real nutty flavor has been processed out of them.  The overwhelming sensation was ""sweet,"" and not in a good way.<br /><br />The cereal did stay crunchy in milk (it floats, just like that ""other"" ""o"" cereal), and it has a sort of mild honey + corn flavor.  My guess is that Kellogg is trying to find something to compete with Honey Nut Cheerios, and this is their answer.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to my Special K Red Berries and Frosted MiniWheats. Oh ... and Northern Gold Raspberry/Blueberry granola.",0
"I love green tea.  I love matcha powder.  I will even admit to all the Matcha Powder snobs out there that I LOVE Starbucks Green Tea Lattes.  It's true.  I get them with Soy milk.  At least I did.  Until I realized that Soy milk isn't so good for you (that's another story).  So I ordered this Matcha Green Tea Powder to make at home with Almond Milk instead.<br /><br />It's good.  I won't lie.  However, it clumps.  I'm not sure if it's me.. or if it is the powder.  All I know is, if you purchase this, make sure you stir it like crazy.  Because if you get one of those clumps in your mouth, and it breaks, it's the nastiest taste I have ever experienced in my life.  The best solution I have found is to simmer it in a pot on the stove with the almond milk and whisk it.  It's a lot of effort, but it helps.<br /><br />Other than that, I like the matcha powder, it makes me feel full of energy and has a good even taste to it.",0

"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.

"I like the taste of this sweetener and I am a huge fan of stevia, but my problem with it is that agave is the first ingredient. Now, contrary to popular myth, as someone in the food biz I can say that that does NOT mean it's mostly agave. As you can verify on the FDA website, ingredients are not listed in the order of what they contain most of as most people believe, but they are listed in order of weight...which means if there are 2 ounces of agave in a pack and one ounce of stevia, (I just made that weight up for explanation) then agave will be read first...even is there is a tablespoon of agave and 2 tablespoons of stevia in a packed (again, that amount is used just for explanation...doesn't contain near that much in a packet.). Since stevia weighs next to nothing, it still may very well be the main ingredient, but we do know there is a good deal of agave... and that's my issue.<br /><br />I actually switched to stevia from using agave as a sweetener (although I still use it occasionally.) because of the controversy and studies showing that it may very well have the same weight-gain effects as high fructose corn syrup due to how your body processes it. There are some very well respected doctors such as Dr Mercola who say this. I scoffed at first, until more reports said the same. I haven't made up my mind yet, but in the meantime I cut back on agave so when I bought stevia I didn't expect to find it there. But it's listed first in these packets.<br /><br />Why do they add another sweetener? Stevia is SO sweet that you have to. It takes a few grains to sweeten a drink...there would be nothing in the packet otherwise. However, I perfer to find it cut with erithritol as this does not spike your blood sure, is all natural, and zero calories.<br /><br />I now simply buy straight stevia in order to sweeten my coffee...in liquid form. It's not mixed with anything and is very economical. One drop sweetens an entire cup of coffee and the liquid form means it mixes perfectly.<br /><br />This isn't a bad sweetener...it could be a bit sweeter if I had my say...but my main gripe is I believe they'd have better marketing if they cut it with another natural zero calorie sweetener with less current controversy.  For agave lovers, however, it would be the best pick. For me, I'm lukewarm.<br /><br />Now, add to that it has silica...this is not in any other stevia products I've bought. Look, I just want stevia...or a stevia and eriythritol blend...but not a mix of stevia and stuff I don't want.<br /><br />Anyone consuming stevia is likely a label reader so I think this product would do well to tigthen its' belt in order to compete...and by that, I mean stick with cleaner ingredients.",0
"The makers of Essential Water claim to deliver ""unmatched hydration, health and taste.""  I'm not sure it delivers all of those benefits, but it is a good option for runners like myself that don't want the calories from sports drinks, but need to hydrate and replenish their electrolytes while exercising.  That said, buyers should now that water comes from public water sources.<br /><br />- Source - The bottle says the water is ""purified by reverse osmosis.""  However, it doesn't mention where they get the water so I called the customer service department and asked.  I was told the water came from ""municipalities""- in other words public water sources.  The person explained that ""it doesn't matter where the water comes from, the only thing that matters is the purification process."" I disagree.  I prefer water from natural springs.<br /><br />- Taste - I didn't discern any noticeable difference.  It tastes like the water I filtrate at home.<br /><br />- Size - It comes in a 50.72 oz bottle. I drink a lot of water through the day and usually have water at my desk.  I find an entire gallon too big to handle and a large cup too small.  I like this size because it doesn't take up too much room, but lasts me about 1/2 a day.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it is cheaper than a sports drink and provides the necessary electrolytes during a run.

"I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.",0

"These compostable bags are definitely that. They will break down, and so are pretty perfect for your typical compostable kitchen waste. However, they are super thin and will break down in your composting bin as well. Maybe not every time, but we have seen about 25% of them begin to break down and leak long before we actually fill it our bin. I would say the average time before the bag begins to leek is around a week. Like I say, not all these bags are apparently created equal, as some do maintain their integrity longer, but it isnt something I would rely on. You are better served changin it out at least once a week, and maybe more often. Dont wait just because you havent prepped as many veggies and fruit this week.",0

"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

"I'm a sucker for good kettle corn and usually buy Orville Redenbacher.  However, they are moving towards that bag-into-a-bowl version which isn't as good and gives you less product, so I decided to give Black Jewell a try.  It turned out to be less than ideal; the kernels are smaller than Orville and there are just as many hulls.  Thumbs down.  Also, this product cannot be returned to Amazon per their policy.",0
"""February made me shiver,"" sang Don McLean when remembering our loss of Buddy Holly. As a blizzard moved into the Midwest this February, and freezing temperatures took over, the shivering started.<br /><br />Proper planning would have supplied me with a broader range of food before the storm, but... that's the thing. I didn't. Snowed in, I could not leave. The United States Postal Service, however, was undaunted, however, and left the box of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey at my doorstep, thanks to Amazon.com. Though not starving, I appreciated the newness of the cereal, different from my usual Cheerios, Apple Jacks and raisin bran. Would it be different enough to add to my routine?<br /><br />Like as when manna came for the Israelites, I gave thanks. While watching ""The Thin Man"" series the next morning, I ate the cereal dry (as I usually do), reaching into the box as if it were popcorn.<br /><br />What's In A Name?<br /><br />* The crunch: loud and grinding, much like the sound of a dog eating a Milk Bone.<br /><br />* The roasted nut: reminiscent of other cereal peanut butter flavors.<br /><br />* The honey: I never tasted honey. I tasted a sweet undertone, but not distinctly honey.<br /><br />* The 10.8 ounces: One box. It took three movies to finish.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, but cannot say I found it distinguished from any other cereal. The flavor is underwhelming, but adequate. I may have it in rotation, but it will not be a staple. May your coldest days be warmer with a good breakfast, excellent mail delivery, and Myrna Loy.<br /><br />--Brockeim",0

"My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.",0
"I tried this flavor today. Its ok, not great, it is different from the regular Chicken flavor and tastes more ""real"" The broth does have some richness to it. I recommend not adding as much water as stated on the package and instead, add 1 1/4-1 1/2 cups of water( it was a bit bland at 1 and 1/2 cups)as they have put less seasoning in the packet in recent years, Im assuming to save money. It wasnt bad though and Id eat it again, perhaps adding some additional seasonings like a little soy sauce( good in a lot of the flavors) but I didnt like it enough to buy a full 24 pack since it's available at the local grocery store for now. I generally like all the flavors Ive tried though. I recommend this product if you want a soup that tastes just a little better than the regular Chicken flavor or like Ramen in general like I do, it isnt bad tasting at all.",0
"Yep, it's a great product!! My kids and husband get a serving or two of veggies with little effort. We love the strawberry banana and peach mango.<br /><br />But the price here on Amazon is ridiculous! There are tons of coupons online and in your paper, and it's on sale very often. Amazon's price today comes out to just over $5 a bottle. Two days ago, I bought ten bottles at my local Ralph's for $1.33 each (they were on sale, plus I had coupons). This sale was in California; my sister-in-law in Texas said she got them for about 70 cents a bottle. If you don't feel like taking coupons, Target's regular price for these is $2.99.<br /><br />Enjoy the drink, get your veggies, and don't spend money foolishly while doing it. You win all around!!",0
"I got the assorted box after I fell into Numi's fabulous tea and wanted to sample the others. However, I noticed that the assortment of teas actually do not enhance each others flavor but rather take away from it. What I mean, is that with so many flavors crammed into one box (18 to be exact) is a collusion of scents and flavors that may or may not be conducive to the palate. I found even the teas I was familiar with tasted rather stale, lacking its vigor. Case and point: rooibos. Case and point: jasmine green tea.<br /><br />On the upside, I did discover that the toasted rice and chocolate pu-erh were rather great surprises.<br /><br />My advice to Numi is to break it up like Celestial Seasonings does: group 3 or 4 each of conducive flavors into a 4 flavor variety box as to not lose its aroma/taste that will offer enough variety and give each box a theme, like Energize, Soothe, Revive, etc. Allow people to choose the sampler they want.<br /><br />In the end: Numi makes wonderful, out-of-this-world, amazing tea. But this assortment did not do the brand-name justice. :( Sorry!!!",0
I especially enjoy the Sun Butter bar. I'd give it 4 or more stars if they didn't go cheap on portion size. Be aware that each one of these packets is easily 40% air.  The actual bar is about the length of an adult thumb. Very skimpy portions.  For some reason it seems as though they shrunk the size only in the last 2 years although I could be mistaken.,0

I usually drink Green Mountain Breakfast blend in the morning but when the 50 packs came on the market at a very reasonabe price Breakfast blend was not offered so I opted for Our Blend.  My mistake.  It doesn't even compare to the full flavor or Breakfast blend.  It doesn't have much flavor.  Very disappointed!  Can hardly wait until it is gone so I can order the other.,0
"Unfortunately my local pet shops don't carry this brand of Wellness, so I was excited just to go ahead and give this a try. Its not ideal for me to have my cats on a raw diet in our small apartment, and many people have recommended Wellness as the next best thing. I'm really impressed with the 50% protein and the quality of the ingredients in this food. However...<br /><br />My cats were not. They just pick at it. I did my best to mix it first, gradually introducing it into their diet, but even after a week and a half, they just prefer their other food (Blue Buffalo). The Wellness pellets sit in the dish untouched. This food does have an odd smell, which also keeps the cats away from their dishes (unless they are absolutely ready to eat-we free feed).<br /><br />I'll be switching them back to their Blue Buffalo diet this Friday. I'm a little disappointed, but also glad that I at least tried.<br /><br />Great quality food, not for my kitties.",0

"As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.",0
"Leave it to Betty Crocker to resuscitate the kiddie concept of the Easy Bake-Oven to produce their Warm Delights Hot Fudge Brownie. The serving size seems to remain the same child's portion as the old 1960's toy since it barely covers the bottom of the plastic bowl that contains the dry powder mix. The directions specifically state a tablespoon plus a teaspoon of water to moisten it, and knowing how temperamental baking can be, I would not try improvising this part or else you will get chocolate mush.<br /><br />Forty-five seconds in the microwave and then you squeeze a packet of sugary Fudge Topping on the top. It's not bad but just seems like skimpy gratification for the 370 calories it contains, 110 of which are fat. There's also 2 grams of trans fat, 270 mg of sodium and 61 grams of cholesterol. In other words, this is not a Weight Watchers treat by any stretch. But if you are in need of a quick chocolate fix, you could do worse. As an alternative, I suggest the much tastier Fat-Free No Pudge! Brownies you can get at Trader Joe's. Without the elaborate packaging Betty Crocker seems to think is necessary for an individual serving, you can bake a dozen and then allocate them as you wish.",0
"I was excited to try this tea sampler with my Keurig Brewer, as it's getting pretty hot where I live and all I usually brew is coffee.  I decided to try the peach tea first.  When brewing, the tea melted most of the full cup of ice that I brewed it into.  After brewing I just poured some up in a fresh glass of ice.  Sadly, the tea tastes much too strong, even after brewing it on the largest cup option.  It's sweetened, but not nearly enough, as the peach flavoring just tasted sour/bitter.  With a little truvia, and some more ice, it's pretty good, and stretched to two servings worth.  But I was hoping for more of a brew-and-go experience.  I don't think I'll purchase this sampler again, but I will do want to try the Southern sweet tea by the same brand.",0
"wow,this coffee packs a punch. The flavor is strong but not bitter like starbucks, and eat something when you when you drink it, two of my family members said it gave them an upset stomach.",0
"For those like me who prefer cheddar cheeze popcorn, this one is a hit. The popcorn pops evenly throughout the bag and it comes out perfectly. Unlike some other brands I tried with minimal cheddar cheeze taste, the cheddar cheeze taste of the Jolly Time popcorn is strong - so much so, as to be perhaps too strong! And also unlike another brand I tried, the taste is ""baked in"" with no need for a messy pourover insert.<br /><br />Overall, the product is very good and well worth the cost.",0
"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'",0
"I've been using these for a while now, as I have sensitive skin and regular deodorants irritate me.<br /><br />It works well, I don't sweat as much, but the dispenser it comes in ""leaks"". How to I describe this... I keep it on my counter top, and every time I lift it to use, there is a round ring of greasy stuff under it, and you can wipe the bottom of the dispenser with a paper towel and see that this is where it is coming from.<br /><br />I can't even find a link on Dove's website to ask if I am doing something wrong.<br /><br />It is in my bathroom, not exposed to sun, or extreme heat or cold. If it didn't leak, I would give it 4 stars, but because of it, only 3 stars. I would give it 5 starts if it wasn't so pricey compared to regular, scented sticks.",0

Just keep out of cat's reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.<br /><br />No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.<br /><br />3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more.",0
"I'm a type 1 diabetic and am supposed to avoid ""bad"" foods. Kashi sort of has a reputation for healthier fare, which initially attracted me to this cereal.<br /><br />What a taste! I enjoy the cereal very much; it's crunchy, sweet, and filling. It doesn't taste as processed as lots of common sweet cereals, and isn't bland at all like typical ""healthy"" cereals.<br /><br />For those without my specific health issues, I'd highly recommend this cereal as it's pretty darn good and relatively healthy. However, it has a pretty high glycemic index and really gives me sugar spikes, so unfortunately after this case I'm done with the product. Farewell Kashi, you sweet seductress of the cereal isle.",0

"These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.",0

For sure, the old saying ""good cannot be cheap"" indeed works.  Will go back to Teavana for the future purchase...",0
"Enfamil is the brand my son drinks and it's been great.  However this new packaging is annoying to use.  I thought it would be like Similac's new packaging (with the plastic container) but Enfamil has a bag inside to keep the formula fresh.  Normally when I scoop out the formula, I like to shake it off to make the scoop even out.  It's really difficult to shake out the formula from the bag and I have to shove my hand in the bag to get to the formula (especially when it's getting low), then my hand gets powder all over it.  I haven't dumped the formula directly in the container because I want it to stay fresh, so scooping out formula is now a messier task.  It takes a little longer too (when I have a screaming baby, I don't want scooping out formula to slow me down).  The only plus side is that there's a little plastic grab thing inside the lid that holds the scooper so you don't have to leave it in the powder.",0
"This cliff bar is much more expensive than the nature valley products. But, it is not worth to be pricey.",0
"I decided to test this drink in three ways.  Chilled, Iced, Hot.<br /><br />I first put the can in the refrigerator over night.  I then divided the can into three equal portions a little less than 3 oz. each.<br /><br />One I poured into a small glass, the second I poured over crushed ice, and the third I put into a cup and heated it to normal coffee temperature in the microwave.<br /><br />I then tasted the chilled but un-iced drink.  I found the coffee flavor came through well enough, but the additives gave it a slightly off flavor from the pure cappuccino taste.<br /><br />I then tasted the iced version - after stirring the liquid in the glass along with the crushed ice.  The flavors disappeared to a marked degree - a slight coffee taste, but mostly just a cold beverage with a coffee background.<br /><br />I then tasted the microwaved version - the coffee flavors were there, but it just tasted like a weak cup of coffee - certainly not a cappuccino.<br /><br />As an afternoon drink when real coffee is not available and you want that coffee flavor, this drink makes an acceptable beverage to gulp down chilled.<br /><br />Don't expect this to be anything like a real strong cup of real cappuccino or espresso.<br /><br />As an explanation of my own preferences - I like very strong coffee - Turkish being my absolute favorite.  Also, an iced coffee properly prepared is a thing of delight to me.  The best I ever had was at a small place in Kyoto where the very strong coffee was chilled and served over ice in a tall glass, with a separate small pitcher of cream, and another of a simple sugar syrup, allowing the consumer to ""fix it the way they wanted.""",0
"I have enjoyed Planters ""HEAT"" Peanuts for years but was unable to find them locally anymore.  I was so happy to find them and purchased a whole box.  Unfortunately the recipe must have changed because they are hardly hot at all.

I doubt I will purchase them again unless they come out in a hotter version again.",0
"I've eaten regular Raisin Bran for about a year now, a few times each week (always with skim milk).  I've also eaten many other varieties over years.  One of my  favorites is another Kellogg's cereal, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E76570"">Special K Cereal, Cinnamon Pecan</a>, so I can't help but compare these two, and for me, the Special K Cinnamon Pecan is far better.  This review is purely what I think tastes best (I'm not a nutritionist, so I'm not going to try and compare which is better for you).<br /><br />I suppose I like Pecans better than Almonds.  I also think the Cinnamon Special K flakes taste a lot better, and stay crisper in milk longer than the Cinnamon Raisin Bran flakes do, and the Special K flakes have more cinnamon glaze on them than the Bran flakes do.",0
"My dogs skin has improved a lot since I switched her to this food. I'm dissappointed in the amount of grains used in it and tomato pomace. Protien amounts are great. For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs, but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food.",0
"I really wanted to like these.  I often carry another ""all-natural"" fruit/nut bar (Larabar, usually cherry flavor) to tide me over on my weekly commute to/from ""the city"" for rehearsals, and figured these fruition bars would be a nice flavorful alternative.<br /><br />Sorry, but it just didn't work out.  These have a somewhat ""pasty"" texture, and a very strong flavor of dates, which is OK, I suppose.  After all, the first ingredient listed is ""organic date paste.""  I would emphasize the ""paste"" part of that.  What's really missing is the STRAWBERRY.  I could almost forgive the texture if these had more strawberry flavor.<br /><br />As it is, these are super sweet, with a rather off-putting gummy-pasty texture, and the overriding flavor of dates.  I just can't give these more than three stars.",0

The picture for this product clearly shows three 1lb bags of dog treats. Instead you get three .5oz bags of dog treats.

my dog is a 3 yr old 70lb American bulldog/German shepherd mix. after buying the thicker 12 inch bully sticks for her I wanted to try something that might last longer. (she goes through a 12 inch bully stick in about 20 mins.) I also wanted something that would be good for her teeth. I started w the large bone but she got down to half of it in about 15 mins. i had read that its not a good idea to feed one that's too large for your dogs size because it could fracture their teeth but i decided to try xl bone anyway (i think it says 80 ir 90+ lbs on the pckg) shes chewed on some pretty hard things before with no issues. but the XL (19.99 where i bought it) she managed to bite chunks off of so I had to take that away and trade her for a bully stick because I was concerned about her trying to swallow the large pieces. i was hoping it would be like rawhides n bullysticks and would get softer as she chewed so she could eat small pieces. but its really hard and stays that way. I'm sad it didn't work out for us because it is healthy and definitely would have been good for scraping her teeth. back to bulky sticks we go.,0
"I bought this roast along with the ""Platinum"" roast.  This roast is darker than the ""Platinum"" roast.  I am struggling with the correct amount of coffee and water and the correct water temperature.  When this roast is brewed correctly, there is just the hint of the dark side without any bitterness, but brewing this correctly has been elusive for me.  I think this roast is as close as you can get to brewing a full bodied cup of joe that is tasty, teases you with a hint of the dark side yet embraces the tranquility of Kona.",0

These are Okay - They are not very sweet which is what I like but if you are okay with that then your golden.

"Growing up in New Jersey, the highest blueberry producer, we ate blueberries like candy when in season. They grow wild in some parts and are cultivated commercially in others. I really looked forward to this cocktail for the blueberry memories and the sale price. It's a good juice cocktail but the blueberry juice is overpowered by the grape juice. Don't get me wrong BOTH are healthy, good flavors I just expected more blueberry. It's 15% fruit juice NO High Fructose NO Corn Syrup, NO Artificial Flavors OR Colors OR Sweeteners. It does have Cane OR Beet sugar as it's 2nd ingredient. Which is fine, my body can handle the sugar better than artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />All that being said, I would only purchase this again IF it was at a super sale price.",0

"This is marketed as ""thin style"", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.",0
"We had been using the Arm & Hammer Super Scoop brand through the subscribe & save option, and found that it did not clump sufficiently, making clean-up for two cats difficult.  The Tidy Cats clumps better, and we've had fewer urine odor problems as a result, but I was disappointed to realize how wasteful the packaging is for this particular item.  It is three heavy-duty plastic bottles which each weigh only seven pounds.  I didn't realize how small a 7-pound jug actually is until we received the first shipment.  Since I've yet to come up with any ideas for reusing the empty litter jugs, and don't like the environmental waste of using so much plastic (even if we try to recycle it, plastic recycling is so inefficient), we may have to find some other litter solution.",0

And last but not least I LOVE Amazon's quick shipping & not having to lug a huge bag in & out of the car up stairs etc!!<br /><br />If Amazon prices are similar to local store prices I ALWAYS opt for Amazon, it not only saves gas but my time and energy, which I am always in short supply of these days!",0

"I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving.",0
"These bars have a nice consitency and taste, good and chewy, and pretty healthy.  But they kind of need a glass of milk to go with, as they're a bit on the dry side.  I think this holds them back as an on-the-go bar.  Now as a breakroom treat at work, or a little at-home snack, where something to wash it down is available, I think this'll do fine.",0
"I actually enjoyed the margarita flavor of these, but this taste a bit too artificial for me to enjoy.  I haven't had an apple martini so I couldn't say if it tastes similar, but it basically tastes like green apple candy.  It's a very pretty drink, but not all that tasty.  You can't beat the low calories though.  I'm not sure I'd drink this again.",0

"This review is for the coffee, not the roaster (Jersey Shore Coffee Roasters). The roaster is fantastic. I would order from them again. True to their word, the coffee had been roasted 3 days before it arrived; the perfect time to give it a try. It came in a resealable gold foil/mylar exhaust pouch with a flat bottom. It was clearly labeled with the coffee type and roast date. Now on to the product.<br /><br />I've been curious about 100% Blue Mountain estate coffees for years, and after much research, the Mavis Bank Estate came up as one of two that I wanted to try. I ordered the 1/2 pound bag; partially because this bean is so %^#* expensive, and also because I didn't want to get stuck with a pound of beans I might not like, and wish I had the fifty bucks back in my pocket. I much prefer Kona or a Costa Rican peaberry to this. It's a nice coffee; maybe too ""nice"". If you're a connoisseur of mild coffees, this is the one for you. It makes Gevalia Light Roast taste like French roast. Too delicate for my taste. I made a few pots, and kept increasing the amount of coffee. It looked pretty scary whe I was using 6 scoops for five ""cups"", but always tasted bland and watery. I tried it with just a hint of sugar, and nothing else.<br /><br />I'm not into 100% dark roasts at all; I hate that burnt taste. In fact I use a medium roast for my espresso machine. I'll try running some of this through it. Maybe It'll extract some flavor from this curious bean.",0
"Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.  I was able to enjoy it on a quiet morning or two when I wasn't demanding the very best.<br /><br />If flavored coffees is your thing, you will likely have no problems at all!",0
I use this product when I want to relax because it smells great but I won't buy it again because it is too mild for my liking.,0
"While the chip is still light and crispy the flavor is off. It does have a nice little kick to it, but to me it tasted more like pickle than jalope&ntilde;o. I think they should be called ""pickle chips""",0
"It's nice round, sweet blueberry flavor.  It's a smidge sweeter/more syrupy than I like so went online to see if it had sugar added.  No sugar, but the licorice powder does explain it.  I normally HATE licorice, so I'm suprised that I still think this is a decent tea.  I don't think it overwhelms the flavor as much as the other reviewer does, but the sweet slightly syrupyness of it does have a lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />I liked it enough, was actually going to give this 4 stars until I realized that I probably wouldn't buy it again, and am unlikely to drink it again except when I need something warm and decaf.  If I'm not excited to drink it again, then I probably didn't like it that much.",0
"Since it's the worst part of the summer in Texas, it was hard for me to say no to ""free"" water from the Amazon Vine program. With daily average temperatures of 105 plus (and no end in sight until September), I am always dying to keep hydrated and it just seems like I never have enough water (and I get sick of buying it so often). So, I thought this was worth a try, despite the seemingly bloated health boasts on the label.<br /><br />First, this tastes like normal filtered water -nothing special. Then, there's the health claims -since I only had one bottle of this and I didn't have the opportunity to see if it makes a difference over time. But let me put it this way: in the harsh Texas heat, this water didn't seem to make a difference at all when it came to hydration, health or anything else. Maybe it's just the heat, but I seemed to have the same benefits as drinking regular (and not-so-expensive) water from the store brand. Perhaps, if I used this over a period of time I would be able to see a difference, but since Vine only sent one bottle it's a little difficult to tell.<br /><br />Verdict: this is an over-priced item that promises more health benefits than it actually delivers. Not worth the price and not the time.",0
"If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.",0
"Just received the item as a Christmas present. We were on vacation when it arrived so I'm pretty sure it was sitting in our apartment post room for a week. The bamboo survived well with the ""crystal soil.""<br /><br />Unfortunately when I opened it one of the four ceramic vases was broken. Actually, I took this as good luck. In China you should never have things in groups of four... it's bad luck because the word for ""four"" sounds very similar to the word for ""death."" I took the fact that it broke as a sign that the universe was looking out for me. ;)",0
"When I saw this shampoo available to Amazon Vine reviewers, I requested a bottle. After a horrible color treatment years ago that burned my scalp and forever changed not only the amount of hair on my head but its texture as well, I'm always interested in shampoos said to be good for hair ""prone to breakage."" The fine print, though, indicates that the shampoo does all these great things, including restoring the scalp's natural moisture balance, only when used in conjunction with the conditioner, which was not sent to me.<br /><br />After using the shampoo and my existing conditioner for a couple of weeks, I bought the Strong Lengths conditioner. I've used it a few times, and so far there's not much to report. My scalp does seem slightly less itchy than it is prone to, but then again, it's not wintertime, when the heater runs nearly constantly and dries out my skin and scalp. I've not discovered the oiliness from using the shampoo that other reviewers have reported, but oily hair is not an issue for me in general. Neither the shampoo nor conditioner are expensive, so buying the conditioner as well wasn't a hardship, but I disliked the asterisk about needing both the shampoo and conditioner to experience the shampoo's true efficacy.<br /><br />I plan to report back in a few more weeks about how well both products work together, but I can't say much about how the shampoo works on its own. Yes, it cleanses my hair as promised, but if it's being nourished, the jury's still out.",0
"The Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit is a Hamburger Helper like dish.  I'm sure they hate that comparison but there it is.  You brown a pound of beef (or whatever ground meat you like) in a skillet, add noodles, water and sauce mix and cook - so very similar.  At the end of the cooking process though you squeeze in a bag of liquid Velveeta and stir in.<br /><br />So how does it taste?  Not bad, but not great.  Honestly the cheeseburger flavoring was not the best and seemed bland overall.  The cheese and noodles were good but the whole I did not find overall satisfying.  I felt it was an average dish and have rated it accordingly.",0
"Again, I'm disappointed with the new Taco Bell creamy sauces. I first tried the ranchero sauce, which was not good at all. This sauce, the creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce, is slightly better but the taste is still not that impressive. For one thing, the jalape&ntilde;o flavoring is quite mild and I prefer a much spicier kick to my food. The best way I can describe the taste is ""manufactured"". It does not taste like freshly made sauce. Too much of the sauce is overwhelming, not because of the spicy factor, but just because the bottled taste would ruin good mexican food made with fresh ingredients. I'm not against Taco Bell brand  I love their canned refried beans and their original bottled hot sauce). These creamy sauces, however, have not impressed me at all.",0
"The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the ""base"" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the ""Apfelschorle"" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another ""regular"" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest ""health"" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price.",0
"These taste alright, but they're nothing special. Would I order them online? No. But I would buy them at the checkout in my local supermarket if they were priced the same as the licorice that's there now.<br /><br />That being said, these do have all natural ingredients, however natural does not necessarily mean healthy. These are candy, like all licorice.",0
"I enjoyed this mixture for a quick lunch with a poached egg on top - made it a bit more savory and I didn't mind that it wasn't more spicy.  The individual who found that the rice was undercooked probably didn't wait the 4 minutes for the rice to sit after the second cooking time period.  All in all, not bad!",0
"Tastes great, although not priced very well.  Needs to be less than .50 cents a cup to be a value and that is including tax and shipping.",0
Every can was dented.  I opened them all and tasted them and I am still alive so I guess botulism had not occurred.  I poured the pretty coral syrup into a vodka bottle to make a substitute for kirsch which is very expensive and called for in some baking recipes.,0
"I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the ""organ"" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!",0
"I took 2 stars off of this product for the following reasons: 1) Way overpriced being it comes in yes 16, but about 2 Tic Tac® size in length 50pc. tins which when received kinda disappointed me seeing as though the picture does not do it justice making it look larger. 2) The product itself is O.K. and does tastes like orange and fizzles on your tongue in this little round pill shaped candies, but fails to have any cream flavoring to go with that which was a big letdown, unlike Jones's actual bottled 12oz. Orange and Cream Soda! Not completely terrible and fun to take a tin in your pocket or pop some while playing video games or watching YouTube videos like I do, but don't overpay at your own risk, seeing as I purchased this through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com at $17.88(about $1.11 per canister/tin X 16) and ended up with a perfectly packaged and swift arriving product but felt like I paid too much given size at that rate(straight Amazon's is listed @ $24.49 just so you know)! It's now up to you?!",0
"I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good.",0
"This has been the right formula for us...I have used this formula with my twins since I stopped breast feeding at 3 months.  They have had no issues with gas, fussiness, etc.  However, Amazon has really missed the boat with pricing on this item.  That is the only reason for a lower review.  My local Target sells the 24oz can for 19.99-21.09.  Find a few coupons and save even more.  Wal-Mart is also on par with the 20/can price.  I know some may not have one of these stores in their area(yes, there are parts of the US that Walmart hasn't found yet...) but considering you'd be saving at least 20 dollars on the six cans it may just be worth the drive...",0
"I found this product to be very tasty, but due to my age, a little hard on my brittle teeth.",0
"I'm sure some dogs find these treats irresistible.  My dog kind of looked at the ""treats"" as regular dog food.  She isn't impressed and is in no hurry to chow down.  They are good for filling a treat ball though if you don't want it empty in minutes.",0
Alright success until the receptionist at the vet said to use Hot dogs. Hmmm.  What dog does not like Hot Dogs?,0
"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",0
"WoW 6 dollars for a box is pretty steep imo. Too bad when I read the Product details: ""Item Weight: 3 pounds"" I thought I was getting a deal, its definatly 3 OZ, like it says on the box. Durp",0

"I was expecting to really like these. I like red vines a lot, and the grape sounded awesome. Turns out they are just ok. Not as sweet as red vines, and really a mild flavor. I'm not into really sweet things and I prefer more natural flavors. That's why I thought I would really love these. In the end, they are just OK. I eat them, but they are not satisfying to a sweet tooth craving in the same way the red vines original red licorice flavor are. My 14 month old loves them, but we don't give her sweets often, so they might be really sweet to her.",0
"I tested this water against my regular tap water and Whole Foods spring water - it does have a smooth and almost silky quality and a pleasant taste. We blind tested all three and could reliably identify each of them (just checking it wasn't my imagination!). I only received one sample bottle so I can't comment on its claim to 'hydrate better' or any of the supposed health effects, though some other reviewers have noted long-term benefits.<br /><br />I like the oversized bottle - if you're trying to drink more water each day, it's ideal for taking to work to measure how much you're actually drinking. It's a good product though the biggest downside is the cost compared with other bottled waters or home-installed filtration systems.",0
"I highly value GU as a supplement, its the only gel I use in running and cycling. However, most of the popular fall marathons, such as NYC, Chicago, Philly, and MCM, are scheduled when temperatures are cooler -- sometimes downright cold! Well, I'm running Philly, which in 2011 is scheduled for November 20th. To train for this marathon, I run at night when temperatures drop. One thing I've noticed on long runs is that when the temperature is 40-45 degrees, and I reach for a GU at mile 13 (about the time I usually do), opening the package is labor-intensive, and ripping it with your teeth isn't the answer when breathing through a challenging point in a course. Try opening a GU gel when running up or down a hill in colder temperatures. Even the top tab (or nipple as I call it) is hard to open. My complaint: THE PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE PREFORATED AND MADE EASIER TO OPEN! I'll say it again, GU needs to make the packaging easier to open for runners and cyclists. It has nothing to do with hand strength. It has nothing to do with sweaty hands. The package should be easier to open. Period. Other than that its a 5-star product in my opinion.",0
"January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.",0
"I think this is a great flavored variety pack to try with your Keurig; however, make sure that's the only reason your getting it. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did NOT receive a limited edition print in a tube or otherwise. Would also not buy this as a gift for someone else without having it shipped directly to me first so I can package it in something other than the plain box it came in.",0
"I did not really dig this flavor, but only because of the diet aftertaste common with most all diet drinks.",0
"My Chow Chow loves this dog food and eats it ridiculously fast.  However, after reading about the ingredients in it, I wonder if it is a healthy option for dogs.  I think I will just mix it with her other dog food for now, so she can have some variety.  This food might be a nice change for your dog every now and again, but I do not think it should be his or her main dog food.  Definitely do some research first!",0

"As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court",0
"While this may be effective it isn't exactly what I was hoping for. The posts go into the ground fairly easily but the wire is above ground and is a little unsightly. I'm not thrilled with this item, but it's partly my fault for not reading the entire description. I'd thought it was an underground fence and not an above ground one. This makes mowing a lot more difficult. While it does work at keeping my dog inside the boundaries I don't think I'd get this again.",0
"The flavor is pretty good. Like others said, not the overpowering vinegar base but a more mellow taste. As a condiment its ok, but as a hot sauce it just fails. Not much heat at all. I've tried tons of hot sauces and have one for every meal and every mood so I can justly say that this just isn't really a hot sauce. Sadly its a lot sweeter than hot, but on the plus side it does have a nice flavor.",0
"To me the flavor is crossed between thousand island dressing and bacon bits. If you like both of those, go for it. I put it on sandwiches and it tastes ok. Probably not something I would buy again though.",0
"The bar is good quality, and certainly what is advertised.  But, if you prefer the typical beef or beef-jerky style taste, this isn't it.  It tastes more like a Slim Jim, which I don't prefer.  If, however, you like Slim Jims, this bar's for you!",0
"I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon.  I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea.  There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing.",0
"We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.  Several cans were dented in each shipment.  Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store.",0
I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product.,0
"It seems that most of the major cereal companies these days are jumping on the Chocolate Bandwagon.  We have Chocolate Cheerios, Chocolate Chex, something called Kashi Cocoa Beach to name a few.  Kellogg's has entered the race to the top of the shelf with this entry - Kellogg's Krave.  Its special claim is to have a crispy multi-grain cereal outside and a smooth chocolate filling.  Its taste is pleasant but not overly chocolaty. I found that the product does not hold up well in milk losing is crispiness quickly.  It IS a good snack for reaching in the box and grabbing a handful to eat in front of the TV when you just need a bite of something good.<br /><br />When comparing it nutritionally to a couple of the other Chocolate cereals I mentioned it falls in the middle calorie-wise; the fat grams are higher but the sodium is much lower.  It hits the middle in carb content; has the most fiber and at 2 grams of Protein matches one & is better than the other.  I won't list the exact numbers as several other reviewers have already done that.<br /><br />For me, cereal just isn't a vehicle for chocolate.  I'll continue to have my oatmeal in the morning and have my chocolate when my sweetie brings me a heart shaped box tied with a ribbon.",0

"so many crumbs! out of the four boxes I got, all of them had about 20% of the box that had turned into RICE KRISPIE POWDER.

I think it's the design of this cereal that makes it crumble easily. if you like eating mush you might enjoy eating this.",0
"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)",0
"First, I have never tried any other coconut water.  The after taste reminds me of peroxide or baking soda when I had a sore throat.  Does that mean it's old, or is it suppose to have that bland flavor?  It's not terrible, it's just not something I'd choose to quench my thirst.  Hopefully the nutritional quality is there, and in that case, I'd be content.",0
This product does not taste as sweet as the individual packets made by this same company.  Unfortunately they donot sell/package individual packets anymore.  So I just add Irish Cream creamer to it to make it taste better.,0
This product has an excellent flavor. I used it in cookies and it cooked up well. I would recommend this product.,0
"I have been using regular splenda for awhile now and I like flavored coffee, so I decided to try this product. It packs more of a ""flavor punch"" when I mixed it with another liquid flavored creamer. This product does not leave an after taste.",0
"I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.",0
Unknowingly ordered this thinking it was a great deal until I saw the S/H charge when I got the package OMG. 11.35 to ship,0
"I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.",0
"Sugar Free and using Agave Nectar, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Soy Free are very important to us. However, we did not like the flavor very well.",0
"Nothing was truly 'wrong' with this, it's just that there was very little Creme Brulee flavor that I could detect. These Keurig cups aren't cheap, so I expect them to live up to their description.",0
"I got this on a whim to see if it was a gross health product or not.<br /><br />Had a bowl and it was pretty good at first. The little chocolate-filled biscuits are crispy and the filling is soft... doesn't really have the texture represented on the box cover (softer than it really is?), but it's okay.<br /><br />It's just that the chocolate taste is a bit chalky/fakey, and has a slightly weird aftertaste. Kind of a boring taste too, to be honest.",0
"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.",0
"My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke.",0
I have to agree with other reviewers who find the description misleading. It does not seem to be any healthier than my dogs previous food (Dog Chow also made by Purina). And while he does love this and ate it more quickly than any other food I think I will stick with what we always buy him. The Dog Chow is cheaper ($12 for a 20lb. bag) for more!,0
no matter how I tried to massage this into my dry scalp it ended up all over my hair<br />okay this could be user error but it took some time to wash out<br /><br />It has a good feel and consistency however just did not work on my hair<br /><br />It is the consistency of a thick Valvoline --nice scent and my hand felt good after trying to apply it but not for thin hair,0
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.,0
I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...,0

"I recently tried and really liked <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3GC"">Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, and since French Vanilla is my favorite among flavored coffees I was eager to try their Parisian Vanilla ground coffee. I had mixed feelings on tasting it (though when it comes to flavors and coffee opinions can be very subjective.) Like the other Melitta coffee bags, this one was a bear to open.<br /><br />The flavor was not overpowering, as is the case with many other flavored coffee offerings. Most importantly the quality of the coffee itself is really quite good. The coffee was very smooth and lacked bitterness. Note their instructions and aim for 2 tablespoons per six ounces of coffee (not per 12-oz mug) or it will be weak.<br /><br />For my tastes the resulting flavor was a bit on the artificial side. It did not taste as much like vanilla I've had from other sources. That said, there were a few other positive factors about the coffee. First, both my wife and daughter independently walked in the room and said ""Wow, it smells wonderful in here!""  The aroma is indeed nice. Second, I made a large iced coffee for my wife with the Melitta Vanilla coffee and it turned out very nicely. (The expectation there was more for a refreshing flavored cold drink more than on the coffee taste itself.)<br /><br />If you're not a fan of flavored coffees, or shy away from them because of an artificial taste, this won't change your mind. If you sometimes like flavored coffee or like vanilla, it's worth trying, keeping in mind tastes are very subjective.",0
"These are NOT CURRANTS.....These are a variety of grapes and I demand that they SHOULD be renamed ""Raisins"".  By no means, these are currants.  I was on a ""Currant Hunt"" since Jamie Oliver's recipe for summer fruit pudding.  I could not get fresh currants (beg, borrow, steal....Sigh...no luck).  So, the last resort was for dry currants (if not fresh, I thought I could atleast use rehydrated dry currants as substitute).  After about 2 months of search, I found a few packs of these at my local Kroger.  I should have read the description.  It was my fault.  These are a variety of grapes that are usually called ""Zante Currants"".  THAT'S IT.  Absolutely not related to currants.  My teacher Google taught me the lesson about these grapes.  Why is it so difficult here in the USA to find even the dry currants?<br /><br />These are VERY GOOD FOR RAISINS though.",0
"It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better.",0
After reading all the hype I was lured in to buying this so-called coffee.  Tastes like coffee grind recycled after first use.  The coffee we buy from local super market costs the same but tastes much better.,0
"I purchased these mostly out of curiosity--I  never purchase cookies of any kind, and especially not the gluten-free variety (taste, texture, ingredients, price...just not worth it).  Before I review the cookies themselves I should explain that I almost never purchase processed food.  (I grind my own flours, make my own crackers, granola, salad dressings, etc.  So my three young daughters were SO excited to try something out of a box...whatever!  The grass is always greener on the other side!)  Anyway, I had seen these a few times at my local health food store and thought I'd give them a try.  If you're looking for gourmet, keep looking, these aren't your cookies.  However, for a boxed, gluten-free cookie they aren't too bad.  The fig flavor is more honest than a fig newton (haven't had in years but never liked), and they aren't as overly sweet as some.  That said, the fig flavor isn't quite strong enough to mask the typical gluten-free flavor of the cookie itself, and as other reviewers have noted they are very crumbly.  I ate the two in my little package and two of my three daughters ate theirs.  (One thought they were okay-good, the other said they were okay.)  The two year old tossed hers over the side of her carseat.  No one asked for more.<br />Honestly, in a pinch I still would not buy them again, but if you like fig newtons and don't want to make your own AND you must buy gluten-free...well, these aren't too bad.",0
"It's mediocre. But it's not as smooth as other Folgers varieties. we like a mild to medium roast and that's what this is, for sure. But there's a touch of harshness that makes it less than desireable. But with coffee, opinions vary wildly! Give it a try. My wife and I wish Folgers would make the ""Smooth as Silk"" in a k-cup. (Not the black silk). It's available in cans and is soooooo good.",0
"like the softness, and it doesen't have that awefull aspartame crap in it. thats the one of the reasons I bought it.",0
"I thought this syrup would be better. I get Starbuck's iced and hot mochas and still nothing can compete. This mocha syrup is good, but not any better than Hersheys. Hershey has a dark chocolate syrup that I highly recommend. Can't go wrong with buying this syrup, but don't expect to be blown away by it.",0
"About 30-40% of the population of Central Europe has trouble digesting fructose.  If you have trouble digesting fructose, it can cause a lot of unexplained abdominal pain.<br /><br />This is almost 100% fructose.<br /><br />Personally, I spent about two months with very bad, mysterious abdominal pain that seemed to be everywhere. After several weeks of doctor visits, discussions about IBS, and an abdominal ultrasound that came up normal, I started thinking about what was different in my diet:  I had been using agave nectar in my tea several times a day.  After throwing out the agave nectar and looking online for a list of lower fructose food, I changed my diet, a little.<br /><br />The pain went away in a matter of days, and hasn't returned.<br /><br />If you're using agave nectar and you have suddenly started having digestive issues, try getting rid of the agave nectar.  For some people, this is really bad stuff.<br /><br />Note to gluten-intolerant folks:  fructose malabsorption can go along with being gluten sensitive or intolerant.  If you're wondering why you're still sick if you're following a gluten-free diet, this may be the culprit.",0
"Not quite sure if this was the taste they were going after, but they taste a lot like rice cakes.<br /><br />The grain mix doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste great considering that it does have evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry pure, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, and sea salt (among other ingredients).<br /><br />It is gluten free and is made from Amaranth, quinoa, otas, millet and buckwheat which is good.<br /><br />It just seems like with all the fruit purees and the cane juice that they'd taste a little better.<br /><br />If you can have nothing but gluten free snacks, then this can be an option for you.<br /><br />If dairy isn't off your diet, putting it on some yogurt would be good.<br /><br />It also suggests putting it with milk, but there are less expensive options if you're considering it for cereal.<br /><br />All in all, it's an okay snack.",0
This is a good product but not as hot as say 100% Pain Hot Sauce. Its has a little to much vinegar taste for me also. shipping was good but took a little over a week to get to my house.,0
"My son didn't like the taste of this.  It doesn't smell as nice as other formulas... and according to a friend who volunteered to taste test our formulas, it tastes the worst out of all of them.<br /><br />It's not to say it's not a good formula, just didn't suit our little guys taste.",0
Besides the fact that this coffee is really dark and bitter there is nothing more to say about it.  Great price though and I wanted to try it out so it's not bad.,0
I thought I had found citric acid powder when I ordered this. It is small crystals. I hope it works for the (rennet) recipes for which it is needed.,0
I am finding that pod coffee is not very consistent when it comes to taste or strength.  I am about ready to back to my old find ground Braun drip coffee brewer.,0
"At this price I jumped at ordering two boxes from Amazon. Overall, the taste of this flavor was outstanding when brewed at the higher ounce capacity, however many of the K-cups in my batch produced an awful-tasting brew. Not sure the reason for that since expiration dates were 10/08 and 11/08.",0
"I can purchase an 18 pack of these at Target for $11.99 (that's $0.61/cup) instead of the much-too-high $0.85 per cup price here. Beware Amazon Prime members....K cups aren't a good deal on Amazon, despite the free two day shipping.<br />The coffee itself is GREAT. I basically like a cup of mud, as bold as it gets. This is that, with a great burnt taste and wonderful aroma.<br />HIGHLY recommend the coffee, but get it at Target.",0
"I like a strong coffee early in the morning and thought Black Tiger might fill the bill.  I do not care for the taste so will not purchase again.  I will stay with my favorite for the best taste I have found in Kcups, Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.",0
"Arrived promptly in 2 days.  The tea was as advertised 100 flo-thru decaffeinated bags at 7 oz.  I enjoy drinking green tea and thought I would give Oolong tea a try.  I did not think that this tea tasted bad but I prefer green tea over these Oolong teabags.  I also ordered ""Sea Dyke - Famous Fujian Anxi Golden Oolong (Wulong) Tea - Huangjingui Oolong Loose Leave - High Grade"" from piermall.  The loose Oolong tea tasted so much better than these teabags.  The loose Oolong tea was more fragrant and had a smoother taste and did not need any sweetening.  It tasted similar to green tea.<br /><br />My boyfriend loves earlgrey tea and he did not like the Oolong teabags but he loved the loose Oolong tea.<br /><br />It says on the back of the box, ""Known throughout Asia as one of China's great treasures, tea is second only to water as a world beverage.  Tea has been linked with health from the very beginning and is prized for its ability to banish fatigue, stimulate the mental powers and raise the energy level.  Recent scientific research reveals that Oolong tea may carry remarkable slimming and health benefits.  Oolong is rich in antioxidants called polyphenols, which is found to be associated with weight loss.  Another important constituent is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been extensively studied as a potential treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer. Epidemiological data have suggested that EGCG may provide protective effects against hormone related cancers, namely breast or prostate cancer.  *These statements have not been evaluated by FDA.

This was ok. Nothing to go crazy about. Pretty bland tasting brownie. Tastes better if you add a lot of Splenda to it.<br /><br />Caramel wasn't a saving grace.,0
"With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of ""100 calorie"" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.",0
When I was opening the boxes I noticed there were some Tully's House Blend KCups included in each box. Besides that issue - I enjoy the Tully's Frnch Roast.,0
I bought this to fit in with my high protein hig fiber low carb diet.  They do taste great and I would give them 5 stars if they didn't include the following: THis product contains SODIUM ERYTHORBATE and SODIUM NITRATES.  These 2 substances have awful side effects up to and including DNA damage...If they were all natural I would buy again but these substances are terrible for your health...If you don't believe me you should google both of them...If this does not concern you then by all means you should check them out as they taste pretty good but I won't be re-purchasing them any time soon...,0
"I received this drink from the Amazon prime program and I decided to try this drink out of sheer curiosity after passing it a couple of times when I was looking for something to review.  I never give much thought to coffee in any of its many forms such as cappuccino, espresso, lattes, half-cafs, and so on.  I would have to say that I drink more Tea than I do coffee so when I saw the tea espresso combo I became curious.<br /><br />So I get the package in my kitchen.  My first thought was what  am I going to do with this.  Do I make it like an espresso or put it in my tea maker.  So I decided to do both at the same time.  The visual aspect of the resulting brew is it appears as a cup of espresso dyed a powerful red.  Too red for my taste but let's see if it tastes good.<br /><br />Here, at the point of tasting the drink, 1st is the espresso;  It carries the red rooibos flavor via the consistency of a thick, punching espresso.  The red rooibos has a very distinctive, sugary flavor that is not exactly the same as coffee. While this is NOT delicious, healthy, robust and bold drink that is a great alternative to coffee but some die-hard coffee drinkers may find the flavor to be different and unusual at first.<br /><br />Up next is the tea.... According to the folks at Red Espresso, Red Espresso may also be brewed as a tea, but due to it's very fine grind it will make a much stronger cup of rooibos than what you would brew with normal rooibos leaves.  It can also be brewed in a regular style coffee maker or even in a french press!  I didn't like the texture of the tea.  Very hot, strong tea, in which the bag's been left for hours.  Not my type of tea.  If you like the taste and having a tea bag in your tea for hours then you should give this a try.<br /><br />My thoughts:  I wasn't expecting it to taste like espresso.  I also wasn't expecting that it would taste like tea. The problem with the arrangement, which I half-feared prior to consuming, is that the two don't blend all that well. It isn't bad, but it doesn't feel proper on either end. The texture for a rooibos drink is key to its amiability, and this just doesn't flow well.  Indeed this would be *an exceptionally healthy* alternative to regular espresso.  If you are a chronic espresso or coffee fiend, and your habit is causing you health related issues such as caffeine jitters, withdrawal symptoms, headache, insomnia, and so on, you switch from coffee to Red Espresso.  It is so much healthier for you than coffee that the health benefits are literally endless.  I think that where this product really shines is as an espresso substitute, and every espresso drinker should give it a try as a healthy alternative to coffee.",0
"I bought this food for my 80lb Staffy Terrier. The food was shipped the same day I bought it and I recieved it within 3 days. The food however did not sit well with my dog, he usually does not have sensitivites to food but this food made him sick. I tried to ease him onto the food over a few days and it did not do much to help he was consistently sick until I changed his food",0
"I understand that when describing or talking about food that ""spicy"" and ""hot"" may be synonymous to some but not others. I bought this based upon an incredible chicken butter cream curry dish I had many years ago in Australia that was flavorful with almost a bit of sweetness but not spicy/hot... I used one of these packets and found it to be WAY too hot for me and for many people who I was planning on serving it to. Spices and ""spicy"" can be great--but this was ""hot,"" and even after adding 1/2 can of undiluted, full-strength coconut milk it was still very ""warm"" even served 50/50 with basmati rice. Flavor DID seem quite authentic and good but the heat can take away those pluses for the unsuspecting.<br /><br />This seems like a high-quality item but the description just wasn't clear about the heat level. Many Indian and East Asian dishes (and even Mexican) will have a heat meter graphically or in words on the package, which would have helped in this case. Authentic, good flavor--yes... but be prepared for more than mild heat.",0
"My three teens (110lb - 125lb) loved the effect of this the first time they tried it (at about 5pm in prep. for an evening swim meet).  Swam fast for whatever reason, too.  Second time around, same circumstances, one still loved it but the others felt tired / shaky / nauseous and frankly looked quite pasty-faced.  Tried a half bottle for those two, for the third time around, and they felt no effect at all (good or bad).  All three times, they had orange flavor and they did not down it on empty stomachs.  So now two don't want to use it any more and one is still interested.  Results definitely vary, therefore, but I'd recommend newbies to try it several times in non-critical situations before you decide to down it to prep for that truly vital meeting.",0

The ingredients are just great that's why I ordered it but when I opened the pouch and tasted... I know it's very healthy but this meal is not eatable.  I have ended up adding few spoons to meals I cook or just other baby food but this is it.,0
"I could taste the cocoa just a little bit but the rest of it is really blah. Some honey and a light sprinkle of salt would work wonders on the flavor. But, after I got past the first one, they weren't too bad. After a couple of them I started to like them a little more. I think it was because I was expecting something more like the Quaker Oats Smores bars with the little chocolate chips that I like. Once I got past my expectations and could just take them the way they are, and not what I thought they should be, they turned out to be almost good. They really need to do something to add some more flavor. I was also surprised at the size of the bars. They are at least twice the size of the Quaker Oates Granola Bars. If they add a little honey and some more chocolate to these I would buy them over the others. As long as the price was the same or lower than the other bars. Another thing that would help the flavor would be to use salted nuts on them. Kinda like the Payday candy bar. The nuts on these are really blah and a little honey would help keep them stuck to the bar too.<br />  I found one of these broke up and added to a bowl of ice cream is pretty good. And I like to freeze those pudding cup things, makes them like ice cream, and part of one of these bars broke up and mixed with the frozen pudding is pretty good too. Makes a different healthy snack food any who. Or closer to healthy than a lot of junk snack foods out there and makes them something different.",0
"Last week I bought a couple Indian-style items in  heatable pouches. My idea was they might be used for a quick lunch. Today, I tried the second of then, Tasty Bite Aloo Palak. It's real easy to prepare. You just partially tear off the top part of the pouch and put the pouch into the microwave for 90 seconds. Afterwards, you empty it into a bowl or wherever else you may be putting it. It dish is all vegetarian with potatoes being the most obvious ingredient. Spinach, tomatoes and onions and a variety of spices are included. The potatoes stand out with the other ingredients cooked into a gray-green rather unappetizing mush. The spicing is very mild for Indian food. The taste is all right, but nothing I'd write home about. The fat and sodium content are low, to it's credit. All in all, I'm disappointed with this dish and probably wouldn't be buying it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0
"I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations.  I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.",0
"Ours is officially ""the house of sugar"" and the Titans that live here have decided that these are about the worst cookies I've ever brought home!  They're about the size of their thumbs and well, they just taste nasty!  There's really no real cheesecake taste, just some sort of ""stuff"" there in the middle that isn't pleasing at all.  It's bad when a bunch of hungry boys will deliberately pass these by - that just about says it all, or so I think!",0
"If it weren't for the expiration, this would get 5 stars. My one-year old daughter loves this food, and I love it because it's super convenient for on-the-go. Just make sure to check the expiration of the product when you get it no matter where you get it from. I received this on May 29 and it had expired Feb 26 this year.",0
This is an excellent candy! It is nearly impossible to find in the stores though. At a dollar and fifty cents a bag it is also an excellent price. Unfortunately when I got to the bottom of the box I discovered that the very last bag had literally 7 pieces of candy in it and not the 4 oz like each bag should have. There is no way I can return it or get a refund which is too bad. This unfortunate problem is why i rated three stars.,0
"In my opinion, the regular Happy Colas are much better.  If you want sour/tangy, sour patch kids are better than these.  I bought a dozen of these and ended up bringing most of them to work for co-workers to eat.",0
"I ran across this item while browsing for something else.  I like to have pickled ginger with my tossed salad, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  Low cost, which includes the shipping!<br />+  Fast shipping & it comes very well packed.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  My first impression was that the slices were too thick & way too large... real big pieces that need to be cut or you'd get more than a mouth full!<br />-  The taste at first is pleasant, but then it gets hot... not really bad, but the odd aftertaste was a turnoff.<br /><br />I'm sure some will like the taste, but I was happy when the last bottle was empty! :(",0

"I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink.",0
"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem.",0
"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say ""lack of"" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste.",0
"Absolutely love the different flavors of coffee that were in this bundle; very delicious and at a decent price. I honestly was a little surprised that it came in such a big box only for the K-cups to be in a brown bag and not in their own box like you buy at the store. Other than that small quirk, I probably will buy my K-cups from here again but not after looking at other sellers.",0
"i find this cider to be too sweet for my taste that is just my opinion as many probably wil probably enjoy the sweetness,the cider flavor seems to be overpowered by sweet.",0
"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",0
"These aren't actually bad. They just aren't as good as they should be.  -<br /><br />Stuffed Grape Leaves have always been a favorite of mine. But I have always eaten them fresh cooked, and never canned. And I just assumed that these Stuffed VINE Leaves were the same thing. So maybe that explains the disappointing taste difference.  -<br /><br />These leaves don't have the strong Tangy flavor that I expect. The rice stuffing is overcooked and mushy, and lacking in flavor. They taste best when served chilled, with some lemon juice squeezed on top.  -<br /><br />If I can't find a better tasting canned product. Then I would probably order these again.",0
"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",0
"Chipotle is one of my favorite flavors in the world.  I cook with them all the time, make chipotle sauces and marinades, and chipotle mustards.  Because I usually make my own sauces and dips, I had pretty low expectations regarding this ""Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce.""<br /><br />My low expectations were met.<br /><br />The chipotle flavor is stronger than I was expecting, and the taste wasn't bad at all.  Neither was it good.  It has a distinct fast food flavor. This is basically a bottled version of the sauce fast food restaurants might put on their ""chipotle burgers"" or maybe a ""chipotle dip"" to each with French fries.  Which is exactly what I used it for.<br /><br />If you are craving that fast food taste at home, then this might be right up your alley.  Me, I would rather just whip together a tin of canned chipotles and some mayonnaise to get roughly the same effect, and probably better.",0
"The advertisement showed Vanilla, the can showed coffee on arrival.  Tow different flavors.  It is a quality product from Blue Sky--a highly creative and interesting company.  I do not care for coffee flavors and would not have ordered this product--however, on giving it to some friends, they enjoyed it.",0
"This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else.",0
Works great in recipes. But I tried them in my coffee and it has a bit of a funny artificial taste. Will buy some flavours in the large size to continue to bake with.,0
"I was attracted to the price, size and pecan flavor.  The coffee is not bad for the money, but I found the roast to be very weak.",0
"A neighbor introduced me to this black coffee and the herb within, and I will be forever thankful to her. After reading these reviews, I was hesitant to even try it for a week because of the very few negative reactions noted here. When I finally dove in and made my first cup of ""ganoderma coffee"", my first impression was that it was the blandest coffee that I had ever tasted. Then the initial jolt kicked in as if I had downed a few shots of espresso. That wore off after an hour and then the ganoderma kicked in about two hours later. (Your system may not react the same!). The ganoderma kept me going all day and completely obliterated my appetite for food and even alcohol, which is a very good thing for me.<br /><br />Then I started wondering about the content of this product and started doing research. My initial guess was that this was mostly cheap robusta coffee with a high caffeine content and very little of the ganoderma. (It turns out that this assumption was wrong and there was very little coffee in this). One reason for the loss of one star in my rating is that the company does not post percentages of each ingredient. However, they seem to be the only one of the products that I tried that states that it is a product of Malaysia. It is well known that growing this mushroom in the tropics of southeast Asia produces the highest content of the active ingredient, which is an enzyme that breaks down dead wood (and junk in your arteries and veins).<br /><br />My neighbor also told me that hot water was needed to activate the ingredient, hence the coffee. Undaunted, I still went on a search to find capsules that were affordable and rated well. I visited two local health food stores and bought two different brands of 100-capsule bottles at a substantial savings below the suggested retail price of Organo Gold's capsules. One bottle scored an absolute zero, while the other bottle scored a bulls eye. I won't tell you the brands, because I spent a lot of time and some money to find this out myself. With the brand that scored the goose egg, I also dissolved the capsules into 8 ounces of hot water and still got no effect. As for the good brand, dissolving them in hot water only made them get to work faster. However, this good brand did not make me quite as hyper as this Organo Gold Black Coffee, so I still tend to believe that the Malysian grown reishi mushroom produces the highest concentration of the active ingredient. Other companies have figured out a way to grow them in laboratories, with mixed results. There are too many claims from each company claiming that their product is best, so the only way to find out is try with their cheapest version first and find out for yourself. A high cost does NOT mean that it is the best!<br /><br />So, if you hate the taste of coffee and like the jolt without the bad side effects of caffeine, then this product is for you. However, the taste of good ganoderma would actually be well suited to green tea, which this company also sells. As for me, I love the taste of good coffee made from fresh ground dark roast Central American Arabica beans, and I actually hate the jolt from cheaper robusta coffees. Since I also found cheaper ganoderma capsules, I have absolutely no use for this product. Since I am not 100% sold on this product, I certainly don't wish to spend all of my free time marketing this product. Those that wish to give it a shot, I wish you the best of luck.",0
"I was looking for some traditional Nori Make but it's hard to come by in the states.  I chose this and was a bit disappointed by how dense the cracker was.  In my opinion, they should be light and fluffy but this was very heavy.  The taste was great, though, and I devoured them in way too short a time.",0
"The coffe is fine, but I prefer a more full bodied and less bitter. I would buy it again but not untill I have tried other coffees.",0
"It's not grape :( it's raison, but it is OK, I just wish I could get the real grape<br />Tastes good, tad sweet. I hate plastic jars--leaked out, but I ate all of it and am buying more.",0
"I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.",0
"This is a good product, that my wife and I enjoyed, but the name of it doesn't match up with the actual product.  It really isn't gooey or that chewy.  It has a good dark chocolate fudge taste that isn't overly sweet, which we both liked.",0
"I purchased this product for my puppy when she was 8 weeks old. It was an appropriate size for her at that time (Boston terrier). It appears well made, but it was not enticing for my puppy. She would rather chew on a bully stick or pig ear than this bone.",0
"I fell in love with clotted cream after a trip to england. I was excited to see that it was sold here, but disappointed at the quality. The texture wasn't the same and the taste was just off. I made some in the oven with a mixture of raw goat milk and cow cream that was much closer to the original English product. When I want clotted cream again, I'll bite the bullet and invest the 12 hours into making my own. This is better than nothing, but not by much. When you brag to people how great clotted cream is and then offer them this, it's understandable when they don't jump for joy.",0
"This Cappuccino for me was just OK. It was just not very robust on coffee flavor or cocoa and too sweet for me however, only 100 calories is a nice plus. I'll stick with Starbuck's for a very occasional, high calorie, indulgent cappuccino treat. I did like the illy caffe' though, it is nice and robust and not too sweet.",0
Opened two of these and found bugs in them but Amazon is sending another batch.  I have used this product before without any problems.  I rated it three stars because of the bugs this time but the Amazon customer service is 5 stars.  I will update this review when the second batch is received.,0
"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.",0
"The sheet itself came as advertised in regards to the color and overall product.  It cuts easily, and you can draw on it as well if you need to make a pattern to cut out.  I tried to use a cookie cutter on it, but that just left a small indentation on the fondant.  This was no big deal as I just used scissors to cut on the indentations.<br /><br />What I found difficult was removing the plastic backing.  In multiple instances, it fell apart as I tried to remove it from the backing to apply it to the cake.  In the end, because we were not going to be eating that part, I left the plastic backing on, and it looked very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it was nice to use in such a way that you could just cut out any shape you want.  If you don't intend to do anything other than place it as decoration on the cake, I think this is a great, easy product.  My sister used it in that capacity, and her cake came out great.  So in essence, I think it's really what you want to use it for.<br /><br />I have not used a sheet to cover the cake, just for decorations.  For decorations, this is much easier than rolling your own fondant.  Also, I only used part of the sheet, and put the rest in storage as it recommends.  I'll try it again in a few weeks and see if it actually kept and update the review with the results.<br /><br />A tip -<br />If you do any painting on the fondant, make sure you do it after the fondant is on the cake itself, as the liquid from the edible paint makes the fondant disintegrate in a way where it cannot be removed from the backing.",0
"I love every other bar that Oskri makes that I have tried.  My favorite is the almond and cranberry fiber bar.  My second favorite is the pecans and raisins bar.  Of all the bars, this one is my least favorite.  The flavor combination sounds interesting, but the cumin really over powers the sesame.  The bar is hard and crunchy and sticky.  Just not my idea of a quick and tasty nutritional snack.",0
"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first.",0
I think that drak chocolate is quite bitter. This choclate is not as sweet and as easy to melt as milk chocolate but still tastes good enough.,0
"This review will be for the Blackberry and Apple flavors of this product.<br /><br />Apple:<br /><br />Several people in my household have tried this flavor and as such there is a wide array of responses to it. One person really like it. Thought it was refreshing, flavorful, and an all around good drink. The opposite end someone thought it was very sour and they didn't like it at all. Me personally, I thought it was okay. For an apple flavor it seemed to taste a lot like a lemon-lime drink versus apple.<br /><br />Blackberry:<br /><br />By and large all of us didn't care nearly as much for this flavor. In fact the person who really liked the Apple flavor thought the Blackberry tasted like a cheap spimonti (sp) wine. I thought this flavor was a little on the tart side and if I am drinking something to be refreshed, tart is not the flavor I would want.<br /><br />I was disappointed in both flavors not tasting like what I expected. For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.<br /><br />The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors. Myself, I didn't care for them but I lean more towards being a picky eater anyway.",0
"This is supposed to be ""Sweet & HOT"" beef jerky.  It's sweet, but it's not HOT.  It's not even hot.  If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.",0
My dog loves this product and it didn't take him long to figure it out.  Which is the issue.  I don't really know if it works his brain much since he has it mastered...,0
"I love this version of Skinner's RaisinBran the best as far as taste goes.  It is the tastiest and stays crisp in milk to the end of the bowl unlike other so-called Skinners versions.  But darn! It has more sugar than the blue box sold by Uncle Sam.  That version has only 8 grams sugar/cup. Sugar is increasingly implicated in many diseases and according to a 60Minutes investigation, is looking like it is a carcinogen.  Isn't it interesting that cancer, obesity, diabetes and other diseases are on the rise at the same time that added sugar is packaged in practically everything we eat.  I am starting to pay attention.",0
"When I received my Keurig coffee maker with a variety pack of different coffees, I tried very hard to find my favorites because there were many I didn't like at all. Out of the assortment, I liked 3 and the Italian blend was one of them. However I couldn't find it in stores so eventually I ordered it from Amazon. Now that I have been drinking this blend for several weeks, it really isn't as good as I remembered. It's okay but I like the Kona and Nantuckett blends better.",0
"The coffee was not stale as some have had, but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this.  I believe a better product could be had with the same beans.",0
"This tea claims to naturally energize without the jitters. I wish it did that. Although ""all natural"", it's important to note that each cup of tea contains about 80 mg of caffeine. That's enough to give me jitters in the middle of the afternoon, which is when I've been drinking this tea for about a month. I don't use any sugar, so the effect is completely a result of the tea.<br /><br />That aside, the tea does somehow relax my brain. My mind wanders constantly, and usually by 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon, I need something to keep me focused and keep me from getting cranky. The only way I can describe the effect this tea has on me is ""calming"". It's easier for me to focus, even though I still feel ""jittery"". One cup of this tea keeps me going through the late afternoon hours, and the ""jitters"" usually subside within one to two hours, while I remain focused for at least three or four.<br /><br />The tea has an excellent aroma. I love opening the package and just smelling the tea-bag -- the scent alone is quite calming. You can definitely smell and taste the vanilla. The spices aren't too overpowering, and I find this tea to have an excellent taste overall. It's not bitter compared to other ""all natural"" herbal teas I've had.<br /><br />Ultimately it depends how sensitive you are to caffeine, but I would recommend this tea for ocassional use.",0
If you are used to dutched cocoa (or you don't know the difference between cocoa processes) you may want to try a single container before ordering the 12 pack.  The taste of this blend is a little unusual compared to the Hershey's cocoa and other brands I have tried.,0
"Chocolate Chip is more moist and tasty. My kids won't even eat them. What a bummer. I am ordering more of the other flavors, which we love.",0
"We love getting this by the case since we drink so much of it.  However, the last case showed up and about 90% of all the bags were not ""stuffed"" and folded closed properly.  Resulting in massive amounts of tea spilling out.  Not the end of the world.  you could just stuff the bag into a tea ball and that would get you by.  We resorted to shaking all the tea to the side of the bag that was folded closed properly and rolling up the edge and winding the string around it to keep it that way while steeping.  Again, not the end of the world but an annoyance.  If the next case shows up like this I think we'll send it back.  But I don't know who to request to make good on it; Amazon or Twinings",0
"This makes a pretty good side dish.<br /><br />This is not bad and sort of authentic. Sort of.<br />This is one of my favorite Indian foods and I have enjoyed it in India and at my favorite Indian restaurant here in the states and I even make it at home sometimes. I am an accomplished amateur chef.<br /><br />This product is very easy to heat and to pour over rice,it only takes minutes and the left overs store well in the fridge and do get better with age. ( Don't we all )<br /><br />Palak Paneer  Pronounced  ( Paneeer ) the latter refers to Paneer cheese which is not in this product. They use cottage cheese instead. But that's ok, it works. Many people don't like and most likely cant find Paneer cheese in the store any way.<br /><br />For some one who is just getting their feet wet with Indian food they will like this dish and if you are a professional Indian food eater this stuff is good in a pinch,<br /><br />If you want to improve it  and make it more authentic add some chick peas and potatoes and a little dry curry powder.<br /><br />I would recommend that people try this.<br /><br />Dean",0
"I'm assuming that most people reading this review have had Maruchan brand ramen noodes before so I don't feel the need to go into much general detail. I don't eat instant noodles too often (trying to go healthier!) but I was curious about these so I grabbed a couple packs.<br /><br />I'm a fan of chili peppers in curries and was curious how this was going to work out. Overall, it was underwhelming. The noodles are the same as always but the powder was kind of weird- after cooking I left the room to go do something and when I came back it had separated.  I didn't prepare it as per package instructions (I made it in the microwave instead with less water and didn't get it to full boiling, though I still added the powder after cooking) but it still seemed weird to me.<br /><br />As far as flavor, it was a kind of bland blanket spicy taste with a hint of chili powder. The spiciness is pretty strong (which I like) but I wanted more personality to it.<br /><br />I need to look at these at the grocery store and see if the salt content is a little lower than other flavors. It tasted like it might have been, and I'd be happy to trade lower sodium for a little less flavor.<br /><br />Overall, I'd prefer pork or creamy chicken flavor. But it's not nasty and it's definitely not as horrible as that time I tried cheese flavored cup ramen.",0
"I purchased the Peruvian coffee and it is only ""okay."" It has a smooth flavor but it is a bit weak and it definitely doesn't brew a `full-body' cup of coffee.  Also, the plastic cup and lid are a little stronger than all the other k-cups that I've tried and every time I put it in the coffeemaker I have to apply enough pressure that I worry that it might damage it.  So, I will still use the product that I have but I will certainly not be purchasing it again.",0
I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.  But this lime and chili flavor...I think I would only enjoy it with a beer.  The lime flavor is just way to intense.  I will not be ordering this flavor again.,0
"I liked the flavor of this coffee, but it seemed to clog up my Keurig coffee maker about 25 percent of the time; this meant that I had to waste fifty cents about once every other day.  I'm not sure if this happened because it is decaf coffee, but I've never had a problem with any of the other brands and I clean my coffee maker out regularly.  I do not recommend buying the decaf version until the Timothy brand has figured this problem out.  Money wasted for sure!",0
Taster's choice hazelnut instant sticks are not available in any local stores.  It seems they are being fazed out.  This is unfortunate as the company already fazed out hazelnut in containers.  Too bad for hazelnut lovers!,0
I bought this to fit in with my high protein hig fiber low carb diet.  They do taste great and I would give them 5 stars if they didn't include the following: THis product contains SODIUM ERYTHORBATE and SODIUM NITRATES.  These 2 substances have awful side effects up to and including DNA damage...If they were all natural I would buy again but these substances are terrible for your health...If you don't believe me you should google both of them...If this does not concern you then by all means you should check them out as they taste pretty good but I won't be re-purchasing them any time soon...,0
"We bought these thinking that they were not in stock in any of the stores surrounding us.  While under the impression that we would have to drive an hour just to find them, we caved in and bought these.  Not but six hours later I was browsing the local Kroger when lo and behold...  I spotted a lone six-pack of Limonata sitting on the shelf of the water aisle.  For one fifth of the price I paid here.",0

"These mints are really good, good enough I went to order more but for some reason they've gone up $4.40 from $14.44 since I ordered in late December. They are good, but not that good.",0
"I initially tried a few brands of prepared raw cat food, including this one before eventually settling on making my own raw cat food. I started out with prepared raw foods because i thought it would be hard to make my own. I was wrong it's not hard at all. My cats are now fully transitioned to raw food and they love it very much. But this food is a good choice to start if you simply want to give raw food a try. It is neat not, messy and you dont have to worry about measuring and mixing cat recipes.<br /><br />All in all my cats never really ate this product unless i cooked it or mixed it with a commercial brand that they liked. But this says nothing about the product itself because cats are notoriously picky eaters and at the time they were also not happy about me switching their food and introducing them to raw food for the first time. My rating is based on the cost not the quality of the product.<br /><br />I realize that this brand is pasturized, farm raised, organic chickens ... and that probaby accounts for the price ... if all of that is important to you then this product is a great choice for the price. But i personally find it too expensive to feed a cat this way long term.<br /><br />I have since discovered that buying powdered cat food supplements plus raw ground meat at my local supermarket is a much cheaper alternative to buying the meat already prepared. Ground turkey in Kroger is $1.50 per pound and the supplements are an additional $3 (per pound of meat) compare that with this product which is 1.2lbs for $7.50 + s/h.<br /><br />So that works out to a cost of $4.50 per pound for me to make my own cat food vs. ($7.50 + shipping) per pound to buy this prepared stuff. Also consider that buying 10 cans of 3.5oz premium canned cat food would cost $6.00<br /><br />(1 lb of raw meat feeds my 2 adult male cats for 3-4 days, much cheaper than buying ""premium"" commercial brands of wet cat food which are laden with preservatives and have very little real meat in them)<br /><br />NOTE: If you buy ground meat in the supermarket for your cat ... you MUST get a powdered supplement for cats to mix in the meat because the ground meat found in supermarkets is meant for human consumption, so it doesnt have the vital bone and organ meat that a cat needs. Adding supplements provide the added nutrition a cat would get from organs and bone. (I was not able to find these supplements for making raw food in local pet stores i had to buy them online.) And mixing the supplements and meat for the cat is simple as pie!<br /><br />My main reason for giving this product 3 stars is for the overall cost to feed a cat long term on this prepared organic stuff. I dont want people who are thinking about switching their cats to a raw food diet to be discouraged, since raw food is the best diet for a cat. I want to present options ... as i showed above it can be done much more affordably using ground meat and powdered supplements. If you can afford to go organic, farm raised, etc., for your cat that is even better but not neccessary to improve the cats health.<br /><br />Matter of fact if cost is that big an issue simply giving your cat properly supplemented raw food a few times per week instead of 100% dry food will drastically improve their health and save them from common cat ailments while not pinching the pocketbook.<br /><br />Remember Cats are not vegetarians, Just like Lions and Tigers they are ""obligate carnivores"" ... they need quality meat for optimal health.",0
"This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!",0
"Well, I am going to be a bit contrary to the higher ratings given this tea. By no means am I a tea expert, but I drink more cups of green tea in a day than the law allows.  I have tried a large variety of teas: green, black, oolong, white..... the list goes on. The vast majority of my tea consumption is  green tea, definitely my preference over black teas, though I do like oolong. I tried my first cup of Mr. Lee's Organic Green Tea today, it sits to the left of my keyboard at the moment as I type this review. When I removed the teabags from the box to put in my air tight canister, out of habit I sniffed the collection of tea bags, curious of the aroma. It was a familiar smell, basically the same ""fragrance"" as I have noticed in many previous boxes of green tea brands such as Lipton, Salada, Carrington, Prince of Peace, etc. I popped my cup of tap water into the microwave and while waiting for the water to heat up, I admired the tidy plastic wrapper which had enveloped the tea bag. I dropped the tea bag into the hot water, allowed the tea to brew, a familiar aroma arose from the cup of tea, again the same aroma as the previous mentioned teas. The first sip, BITTER, what a disappointment. And the bitterness lingers, objectionable bitterness. I found the tea to be quite bland, void of any nice flavors that would elevate this tea to nice aromatic status.  But, hey, the price was right and I liked the individually wrapped teabags, that's why I gave it three stars. But price and clever wrappings do not a good cup of green tea make. To date, my favorite affordable everyday tea is Sencha, Japanese green tea packaged and marketed by Yamamotoyama Tea. Give it a try, you might like it too! I prefer the loose tea style as opposed to individual tea bags, loose tea is a bit ""greener"", more earth friendly, omitting the tea bags and wrappers.",0
I love strong coffee but this is a little to much for me. Kind of has an after taiste to it also,0
"Initially I was a fan of Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee. It's convenient, it's tasty, and it's an affordable alternative to an in-store iced coffee. However after taking the product home, I was shocked to discover just how much sugar it contains. The first thing you notice when emptying the packet into a cup is the huge amount of white granules staring back at you.<br /><br />Each VIA packet contains 22g of sugar, and just 4.6g of coffee! This is the equivalent of SIX packets of sugar! Starbucks says each VIA is two servings, meaning 11g of sugar each, but you're likely to have the whole thing (14-16oz with water) in one sitting. That's 100 empty Calories (more if you're adding cream).<br /><br />PROS: Quick, tasty.<br />CONS: Too much sugar, slightly bitter/burnt taste.<br /><br />NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Starbucks needs to either cut the sugar content in half, or make a ""light"" version using Splenda or Stevia as a sweetener.",0
"I like that its deet free, but found a better alternative that last a long while and has additional benefits.  I would buy this again as a secondary alternative.",0
"These are bad, but they are great. They pretty much taste like corn flakes. Love the kinkajou, thats why I bought it!!",0
"I would call this ""fudge"" rather than brownies. My husband didn't like it, my son ate a small piece but wasn't too impressed, I thought they tasted OK but whatever ingredient is in it, it gave me awful cramps and bathroom issues, the same problem I get with sugar free candy so I guess I should have known. Sugar free ""fudge"" is a great concept but I guess there's no real way to be slim and still eat brownies because this is not the answer, atleast not for our family, unfortunately.",0
"I ordered this a while ago and absolutely loved it. The spices are wonderful and the dish with rice and Naan bread make an excellent meal. However I recently discovered you can order directly from Tasty Bite and their 12-Pack is half the price. As you might have guessed, I will be ordering from them instead of amazon. I gave it 3 stars because of the price. If it were just about the product, it would be 5 stars.",0
"Wasn't so sure I would like this one but it is pretty decent. I guess my main reason for only 3 stars is that I<br />don't particularly like it that the juice is in cans.  But, it is refreshing.  I have tried many brands & flavors and my one consistent opinion is that all the brands taste better in their natural coconut state without other flavors added (e.g. pineapple, mango, lime etc).",0
Had leaking from 4 of 6 containers.  the top caps seems to be weak part that it easily breaks.. amazon did refund the leaky ones.. but I won't order these..again..  Don't want to take another chance on leaks.. although these taste better than the plastic resealable ones at 11oz.,0
"I've tried green tea verses oolong tea and read a report from The Journal of Nutrition, 2001, 131:28482852 that said oolong tea is better than green tea. This tea tastes good and has a nice flavor to it, but I'm going to stick with oolong for weight loss.  The best bang for the buck I found is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ALNL6"">3 Boxes of Wu-Long (Oolong) Premium Slimming Tea - All Natural Diet Oolong Tea , 100% Pure and the Original</a> where there are 60 bags in each box.  For the price, this is a nice green tea with a smooth finish and green tea does have other benefits outside of weight loss.",0

"The problem, for me, with this oil is that it tastes so, for lack of a better word, gross.  It was said to have a ""nutty"" taste, but to me it tastes like marijuana smells, only stronger.  Not an enjoyable or pleasant taste at all.  I purchased this to help with migraines, but haven't been able to stomach it.  Fortunately, I found that magnesium is helping, and going gluten free has worked miracles overall, so I am not too disappointed.  And the reason I gave this three stars?  It works great to make a beeswax, coconut, hemp oil blend that I can use for a lip balm (just melt together in the microwave and wala!),  I can't taste it when I use it this way either, as the coconut oil and especially the beeswax nicely overpower.  And my lips are feeling great this winter!",0

"""Purina Beneful"", doesn't that sounds healthy? I felt optimistic. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I looked at the ingredients, I was disappointed to see the first three were ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal.

"These are nice and at $28, a good value.  They taste yummy and are pretty satisfying.  They're vegan, preservative free, and have only a half gram of monounsaturated fat each.  My only issue is that the calories are a bit high and the nutrients a bit low.  Each (appx) 5x3"" cracker is 70 calories and has only 2 grams of fiber.  Aside from phosphorous and magnesium (6 and 4% RDA respectively) the only health benefit is 2 grams each of protein and iron.  For a cracker, they are pretty filling but it's still easy to go through a LOT of calories in a short time.  With a thick, no-sugar spread a couple of these would probably suffice for a heavy breakfast or light lunch.",0
I am a fairly sophisticated tea drinker and I prefer good Taiwanese green tea (which is 100 times better than tea from China).  This particular k-cup is o.k. but it is more of a Japanese green tea like flavor (darker green).  If you like a good cup of Japanese tea then this is o.k.  I have not found any good k-cup green tea but again even these are much better than Lipton.,0

I was disappointed because I really wanted the Rain Forest Nut (but didn't get it) and I really don't like the blueberry flavor (already had a box of it).<br /><br />The coffee is good, but don't be surprised if you get different flavors than what you were expecting.",0
"It's a pretty good effort, considering it's one of Tracey's first workouts.  Greg Twombly produced it and Tracey should have stayed with him since her subsequent workouts have not as good production quality.<br /><br />This workout consists of 9 Step Routines.  Each routine is followed by a 2 minute intensity blast.  Tracey teaches TIFT(take it from the top), meaning that you repeat each routine after you've learned the next routine.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this workout:<br /><br />*Tracey's style.  As a long-time Cathe fan, it's nice to have a different personality and style to follow.<br />*The short step routines. They're a bit complex, especially routine 2 with the baby mambo, but they're over quickly.<br />*The intensity blasts are tough!  They sneak up on you.<br /><br />What I didn't care for in this workout:<br /><br />*Tracey's voice is very loud and she appears to be yelling the instructions.  Maybe this is her natural teaching style, but it gets annoying.<br />*The step routines aren't that intense.  I made them more intense by using 2 risers on each side of my step. Tracey and her crew are only using 1 riser on each side.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good intermediate step workout, especially if you like somewhat complex choreography without a lot of breakdown.",0
"This product was .78 cents a quart one day, which made it about .02 cents cheaper per quart than the local supermarket.  Now it's jumped to .90 cents per quart making it .10 cents more expensive per quart than the local supermarket.  I gave it 3 stars because of the massive jump in price but the quality of the product itself gets 4.5 stars.",0
"After using another product, I thought I'd try something less expensive and that led me here.  The very first dog walk and the bottom of the bag dropped open splattering poop everywhere.  I was very disappointed.  On the positive side, the folks at the company stand firmly behind their product and sent additional bags to me.<br /><br />I have been using these now for three months and just set my account to auto-order.  I've come to the realization that for my larger dog (42 lbs.), I need to double bag.  While this should not be, they are still the least expensive option available that is earth friendly.  For my daughters chihuahua, these bags do fine.  If your dog is medium sized or bigger, prepare to double bag and order appropriately.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone owning a small-medium sized dog (>30 lbs.) and strongly commend the company's customer care.",0
"There is decent value in the product and the packaging is first rate. However, the jerky is almost rock hard making it difficult to chew.",0
"This is Velveeta's attempt to be a dinner-in-a-box like Hamburger Helper products and variations.  You provide the chicken, Kraft offers the cheese, pasta and seasonings.  Nothing extraordinary but it qualifies as a quick dinner fix when you aren't in the mood to cook a whole lot.  The seasonings were tasty but honestly, anything with Velveeta cheese as a main background can't help but be yummy. The freeze-dried brocoli barely came close to remsebling the real thing in looks much less taste. My end results didn't look anything like the picture on the front of the box but it tasted fine.  I do think Hamburger Helper is better in capturing flavors and more satisfying in the fill-you-up department but this is a good attempt at the same thing.  Would I choose it over another, probably not.",0
"This tastes very similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and seems to be identical except for a touch of Kiwi and Strawberry juice.  Its got 135 calories so is not a diet drink.  It's really sweet and would go well as a drink mixer like the watermelon strawberry variety.<br /><br />It's got light carbonation, 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C and costs about $1.00 a can.  Personally, I'll stick to plain old tap water because this is really just extra calories and not worth $1.00 a can.  It is a nice fruity sweet drink that many might like to go along with lunch.",0
"Our four cats liked the Petite Cuisine for a couple of short weeks, but now none of them are interested in eating it (including one voracious eater who eats most anything and is the first at the bowl and the last to leave).",0
"The tofu shirataki was everything it was claimed to be--not much to my liking, however.  But I am glad that I tried it and will move on from here.  The service from Amazon.com was terrible, the shipping charged-outrageous, plus the amount of time it took the item to arrive was unacceptable.  I will never again purchase from Amazon.com, and will advise friends and family to follow suit.",0
"Foojoy China Classic Min-nan Oolong (Wulong) Tea<br /><br />Personally I prefer a very strong mug of tea so YMMV.<br /><br />My first sip and I was disappointed in the tea. I thought it was weak and lacking in body but it had an interesting aftertaste. Not nutty but I've seen this tea's taste described as Toasty. Good word.<br /><br />The tea is very good with food. The tea doesn't overwhelm the taste of the food  and the toasty tea aftertaste really seems to accent the food's flavor.<br /><br />So 2 stars for drinking out of a mug, early on a cold morning; 5 stars in a tea cup, whilst scarfing down foods.",0
When I was opening the boxes I noticed there were some Tully's House Blend KCups included in each box. Besides that issue - I enjoy the Tully's Frnch Roast.,0
"I've been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down.",0
"I was a bit hesitant to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> because I typically do not like flavored coffees and prefer whole bean coffee which I can grind myself. But for a flavored ground coffee, I suppose this one is OK.<br /><br />The flavor is not bad but the aroma is intoxicating. (I think I prefer the way the coffee smells rather than how it tastes.)  The lightly roasted Latin American arabica coffee beans are flavored with ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root, and the ambiguous ""natural flavor"" (which also includes corn maltodextrin and vegetable glycerin). The vanilla is highlighted but not overdone.<br /><br />I usually drink my coffee black and without sweetening and for my taste <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>  can stand alone without additional enhancement.<br /><br />The brewing recommendations suggest 2 Tbsp coffee for every 6 fl oz water.  I find that a bit too much and get a smoother, less biting flavor with 1 1/2 Tbsp coffee per 6 fl oz water, but that of course is to my taste.<br /><br />I do wish the coffee could be fair trade and organically grown but Starbucks states on the package that the coffee is ""100% Responsibly grown.  Ethically traded.""  At least that is something in the right direction.<br /><br />Finally, I noticed a special offer on my package ~ take the empty bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> to a participating Starbucks and receive a free ""tall"" brewed coffee. That's nice, eh?",0
"Because I really love red rooibos, I decided to try the green variant as well (after all, I do prefer green teas to black teas).  But I was disappointed with this infusion, which was somewhat pale and tasteless compared to the Davidson's red rooibos that I bought from Amazon in the same order as a test.  Even so, the green rooibos does make a nice base to try adding other, more pungent herbal teas, and the price was so reasonable that experimentation is easy to justify.  I suspect that the processing, not the underlying botanical product, is why this variant seemed bland to me, but everyone has his or her own tastes, of course, and you might conclude otherwise.  What's clear, though, is that if you know and like green rooibos, you just can't beat the Davidson's price on Amazon.",0
"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.",0
"I have given my cats this catnip, and they don't really react much at all from it. They just roll around in it, and that is all. They don't get catnip that often, so I don't know if it is the product, or that my cats have a high tolerance to catnip. Thanks.",0
I like these but they are a bit sweet for me. I prefer Honey Nut Cheerios which don't have the crunch or the nuts.,0
"The Kind bars are just too sweet for me. But I love the fruit and nut ratio and crunch with every bite. I was hoping this would work because it's gluten and wheat free, all natural, has a low glycemic index and a decent amount of fiber, no trans fats and the price is great on Amazon and with ""subscribe and save"" it's even cheaper.",0
Take care if choosing this food as they recently released a new formula that has more grains and has resulted in the superpoops for my dog that I have been feeding canidae for 2 years.,0
"This product tasted pretty good, but my milk production didn't seem to change. Maybe a very slight increase, but not enough to make me want to buy the product again. In addition, after a couple days of drinking it 3, 4 times per day, I smelled very strongly of maple syrup :)",0
"have only used this once when i received it --- there is a 30 year old onion bulb plant on a coffee table next to one of the couches, i sprayed it lightly with this and a few days later half the green ""leaves"" turned yellow and brown --- odd enough, have not tried it on any other plants...",0
"I rarely write reviews, but this time I feel the product turned out to be below my expectations.<br />First - it's a really good value (at the local craft store I bought 7 pc net for $3, which is exactly twice more expensive than this product)<br />Second - the pretty bag is made out of organza in its top part, so it arrived torn, even though it was packed well.<br />Third - there's no true information about the size of coins. About 2/3 of them are large 2 in, but the rest 1/3 is smaller 1 1/4 in.<br />Fourth - they are not as neat as more expensive ones: some are unwrapped, some are smashed, letters on the coins is barely visible, which is also ok for the price.<br />Considering all of the above, the price is good, but the quality is below average. 3 stars!",0
"The quality of the tea was good, but the flavor was possibly a bit too much. I love clove and other powerful flavors, but this required a lot of honey to balance.",0
"We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.",0
"January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.",0
"Food tastes are definitely subjective. Wouldn't buy these again, but that is just my personal taste preference. I love the black sesame rice snaps from the same company.  These Tamari Seaweed I dip in hummus to augment the flavor, the black sesame rice snaps I savor without any dip/flavor as they are so delicious without anything else. Ingredients are simply whole grain brown rice, tamari and seaweed.",0
"These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA. My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US. As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs.",0
"The price is comparable to brand name whole wheat pasta available to me locally so I have no complaint regarding that. The texture of this particular brand however is moderately  good. Some whole wheat pastas use a higher grade of  wheat making it lighter in color and slightly more tender ( Bionaturae and De Cecco  pastas comes to mind) . This pasta is darker in color and has a slightly grittier texture then those brands however it is still better then the bargain basement brands found for less. I found cooking it for slightly  longer then  the instructions call for and in a LOT of water helps to make it smoother. I would use a heavy, more robust sause for this pasta but otherwise we weren't really disappointed.",0
"I love Morrocan chicken and a good Ras El Hanout spice is essential for this dish.  I was suprised at this blend, it differs significantly in the balance of flavors from the one I was originally introduced to.  This is a much more savory - curry-like spice than the more sweetly cinammon-heavy original I started with.  I'll have to try others to understand better if there is a 'standard' for Ras El Hanout!",0
"This food might be better for my cats over all health, but my cats prefer the regular Friskies Whitefish pate.<br />As I said to my three cats, just yesterday.... Sorry, The regular whitefish is on its way.",0
"Nothing too spectacular with these hard candy. Tried a few but first they must be removed from their individual and sometimes annoying, packaging. Sugar free is a good thing but who really knows what the term really means when they are using sorbitol? I have no time to complicate matters in my eager existence but must confess that I have been sold for a long time to the name Crystal Light. I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time. The price for the Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile seemed appropriate for what we received and for sure they will get consumed. 3 Stars at the risk of being unkind for I did read the many loving reviews about this product.",0
"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.",0
"It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though.",0
"I love the CLEAR Conditioner and even though I received a bottle of it for review, I'll keep buying it.  The difference in my hair is amazing and though I complained that I'm getting weird little tangles at my hairline, it dawned on me that that's because the product is so good.  Duh!<br /><br />So, since I'd used the CLEAR conditioner with my regular shampoo and getting fabulous results, I was expecting great things from the CLEAR shampoo.  Alas, I've been using for about a month now and have come to the reluctant conclusion that it's merely average.  It smells wonderful and gets my hair clean, but it's not making any more difference in my hair than just using the conditioner.<br /><br />If you like your grooming products in matched sets, then by all means purchase away, but there's really no need.  It's possible to get the CLEAR results from the conditioner alone.",0
"i enjoyed the Monocultivar Biancolilla and looked forward to tasting the Monocultivar Nocellara. it was alittle too strong for me, very, very peppery. i prefer mild olive olis. but if you like stronger flavors, you should enjoy Nocellara.",0
"These crunchy sweet golden nuggets are tasty, and thankfully for those of us with poor impulse control, in small portion pouches (one 130 calorie pouch = 3 Weight Watchers Points Plus).<br /><br />I wasn't that thrilled with the Fudge drizzle; it didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much taste. An occasional hint of chocolate, but mostly just waxy blandness. Thankfully, it's just a light ""drizzle"", and not a full coating.<br /><br />I don't know if they offer this option, but I would prefer just the plain caramel corn; without the fudge drizzle, they could increase the portion size a little for the same calorie/points value.",0
"While these tea bags make a decent cup of tea, I wouldn't call it chai. It does not taste very spicy, nor does it have a very fragrant aroma. The only spices listed as ingredients are cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves. Celestial Seasons India Spice Chai tea bags list those four spices, plus nutmeg, black pepper, Chinese star anise, chicory and vanilla bean, for a much better cup of chai.",0
"I ordered the KoJel because I have some Kashrutd observant friends coming for lunch, and<br />plan to make a salmon mousse.It arrive promptly, is just what I need--no store aaround here carries it--and I will keep the extra packages for vegetarian guests!  Perfect. Sugar-free is a plus",0
"In Atlanta, where I previously lived, at least one large farmer's market made its own flavored coffee, in a multitude of flavors.  Alas, not so here in Portland.  This coffee is okay, but not great.  The flavoring in a little to subtle for my taste.  Acceptable, but...",0
"I've sampled three coffees that had received a lot of 4/5-star reviews, and after tasting all three, I would rank this coffee third in the group.  I agree with another reviewer that coffee preferences are a very personal and subjective matter, but here are my brief comments about the three I tasted.<br /><br />I found the Lavazza Super Crema smooth, but ""flat"" as far as aroma and taste.  I had bought this one based on the review of several persons, one of whom had drunk it while growing up in his native Italy.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Maybe one of their other varieties is better?  I'm reluctant to take a second gamble.<br /><br />I bought a bag of Blue Mountain Blend after my fiance said she liked it, even after she had tried the pure Blue Mountain Jamaican whole bean coffee several times.  I noticed that the bag looked way too big for the 2lbs. of coffee beans in it.  To me, that indicates room for air space that would cause freshness to be compromised.  Nevertheless, the coffeeForever48 behaved like a total jerk.<br /> And I mean that in the nicest way possible. I made had a nice smooth, strong taste, but I still would rank it second.<br /><br />My number 1 ranking goes to Marley coffee's Jammin' Java Lion's Blend.  It had a rich flavor with just a hint of ""roastiness"" that added a pleasing note to its taste.  This one I will buy again.  Bear in mind that Jammin' Java is not necessarily Jamaican coffee beans, but as I indicated above, personal taste is what counts.  The Marley beans are slightly smaller, darker, and more oily than the other two.<br /><br />I am open to any other reviewer suggestions...<br /><br />10/01/11 Update - Brewed both the Blue Mountain Blend and the Lavazza Super Crema in a French Press after grinding in a fairly high-rated conical grinder.  Blue Mountain Blend wins competition hands down, IMO.  The Lavazza is strong, but does not have the pleasing notes in the aftertaste that the BMB has.  Will add to this review after I try French Pressing the Jammin' Java.",0
"Remix to what?  Similarly to R. Kelly's jam ""Remix to Ignition"" - The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original.  That being said, I like this gum.  It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply.  It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ8P62"">Orbit Citrusmint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)</a>.  You can't win 'em all.  Truth be told, that is a better gum.  This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country.  I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby.  Review over.",0
"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",0
"The protein is high quality and appears to have all the right ingredients, but the taste isn't so great and it doesn't create a very thick shake.  I prefer Met-Rx whey protein over this, as in my opinion it tastes better and keeps me full longer.",0
"Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.",0

I have to say that I do really enjoy some of Coffee Directs other coffees.",0
"The noodles don't really have too much taste on their own, but they have an unpleasant smell that does not seem to go away, even with rinsing.  The shipping box was damaged and I was missing one package.  Overall they are OK.  One positive is that they do help fill me up!",0

"They were OK. Not great not bad. The number of flavors were limited. Some were, for lack of a better expression, soggy, and the longer they remianed in the candy bowl the worse it got. Those that were not soggy were very good, but they were really a substitute. What I was looking for, and still cannot find, is a similar candy from my childhood. There was no name brand on the candies themselves, which is likely why I can't find them. They were wrapped in white paper, had pictures of the fruit on them and were shaped as a rectangular solid perhaps 1 x 3 x 6 cm? If you think you know what I referring to, please let me know. Thanks.",0
"It's the same Friskies as you buy in the store, and the per-can cost is lower, but by the time I threw out all the cans that were leaking from being banged up (and some smelled really bad) the cost per can was more than what I buy locally.",0
"As another reviewer said, this is a good base. I added a touch of chili paste, some more lemon grass, and some salt. By itself I would say it is too bland, otherwise I would have rated it a 4 star. I will buy this in the future if it is on sale, but otherwise I will skip it.",0
"You can count on Jack Links to provide a tasty, consistent-quality product. This Mega Pack is a great value, too. Still, I try to purchase smaller, boutique brands whenever possible.

"I like that this mix is **very** lightly sweet and salted (note, maybe too bland for some people). Not sure if the mix, or the can I got, but there were A LOT of almonds and pretzel sticks in mine.

"These 1.5"" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.",0
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",0

"For Timothy's Midnight Magic to be the highest rated K-cup on Amazon, I'm thinking 2 things could be off:<br />1) I received a ""bad batch"" which several reviewers are so fond of referencing.  Or<br />2) The people writing reviews have never been outside of a Starbucks and think a French Press is something you do in the gym.<br /><br />In general I have a low opinion of K-cups, and Tim's didn't do much to change that.  The roast was quite heavy and I found the flavor flat, and lacking character.  I have tried many different types, but Keurig just doesn't deliver quality results.",0

"Our family has 2 dogs- a lab energetic and healthy named Jake, and a Terrier named VitaHound with certain health issues: VitaHound's digestive system is sensitive to typical commercial dog food.

He loves treats and I was sure he would see this as a treat with all the shapes and colors (ok...dogs are color blind but)<br /><br />I think dogs are slow to change what they are used to so I wouldn't take this as meaning your dog won't like Beneful.  Nutritionally, it looks like it is good but I can't tell how much of that is marketing.<br /><br />I'll revise if our dog seems to acclimate more to this.",0

"After drinking an entire case, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed by the lack of results.  Normally I drink home brewed organic unsweetened mint iced tea & home brewed organic kombucha rather than plain water.  I did not drink mint tea nor kombucha while I was consuming this case of water.  A bit of a change for me, but I stuck with it & now I have my results.<br /><br />I do not feel that this water ""enhanced the quality of my health"" I quickly became tired of drinking it & noticed I was drinking less & less each day.  I cannot agree nor disagree that it hydrates me better than my normal beverages of choice because I felt no different than any other day.  I know that my normal beverages of choice are beneficial in many ways, one of them being to my digestive system. I'm not too sure if this water can make that claim.<br />If I have a choice in water, I normally select mineral water bottled in a glass bottle.  I also make sure that the mineral water lists the mineral content.  I feel that packaging Essentia in plastic is counter productive.  I do my best to avoid plastics in all shapes & forms.  I understand it is costly to ship glass but using plastic costs a lot in a much worse way.<br />Last, Essentia water most likely is treated municipal water (by treated I am referring to their treatment method, not the various municipalities methods). Essentia makes no claims that the water is ""Spring"" or ""Mountain"" water etc.  It is purified water with their proprietary technology as per the bottle.<br /><br />On the plus side: Overall for the amount of water you get, the price seems pretty reasonable.  It is cheaper than what I pay for a bottle of mineral water ounce for ounce.  The large size means there is plenty of water to tote around without worry that you will not have enough.  It does not taste bad.  It doesn't taste extraordinary. It tastes fine.  I have had bottled water that was disgusting.<br /><br />A 3 star rating by Amazon standards means ""It's OK""  So while I don't hate it, I don't love it either. As for the health claims, well I don't believe them.  Obviously you want to drink clean water & be hydrated since being dehydrated is unhealthy.  So for arguments sake I suppose if having this water causes you to drink more water when you normally were not consuming the amount of liquids your body requires & now you are consuming the amount of liquids it requires, you will in fact feel a lot better!  Then said health claim is true! Phew!<br /><br />Be good to your body & you will feel good.",0
"Okay, these cookies have a nice, rich chocolate coating on one half of the top and they're a nice texture.  However, I could NOT taste ginger at all, and my cookies came a bit messed up--corners crumbled off, icing melted onto the outer wrap, and cookies stuck together.  And even with subscribe & save these are very expensive.  Edible but not worth it.",0
"I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with ""Breakfast in Bed"", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  ""Breakfast in Bed"" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC"">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K"">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM"">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing).",0

Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.<br /><br />If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.<br /><br />It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good.",0
"Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together.

"I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly!

"The makers of the water claim that Essentia is purified through reverse osmosis, is electrolyte infused, hydrates better and has a pH of 9.5.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I didn't think it was particularly smooth - I much prefer the taste of Fiji.

Try it out if your a fan of the flavor.",0
"I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.<br /><br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but....<br /><br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have ""Special"", ""Extra Special"", ""Extra-Extra Special Extended"", and ""Ultimate"" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.  What's it going to take, Warner?  A bio-exorcist??<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJ....  SPECIAL EDITION, PLEASE!!",0

"I was researching different flavors and reviews on K Cups. I came across Jet Fuel which was supposed to be one of the ""Boldest"" K Cups available. They arrived this morning and I could not wait to try them in my machine. I was quite surprised on how not so ""Bold"" they tasted!<br />I have tried quite a few other brews and I found the ""Jet Fuel"" to be the same or less ""Bold"" than the other ones.<br />I would suggest if you are considering this brand due to its ""Bold"" flavor that you only purchase a small amount first. I purchased 2- 50 count boxes and sure I will use them but I will still use the other brands that seem to be more ""Bold"" such as ""Expresso Roast"" and others.",0
"This does have a true coconut flavor.  However, when I got it, the manna had obviously melted and then solidified again (it had obviously been on its side when it melted, because that's how it was when it came to my doorstep).  I had to soften it.  The directions said to set in hot water for 10 minutes to soften, so I did.  Still hard as a rock.  Tried setting the jar in hot water for another 20 minutes, but it still didn't soften.  So I put it on my kitchen heater vent for an hour.  That did the trick; it was mostly softened, so after stirring the hard part into the soft part, the jar went back on my heater vent for another hour.  The finished doing the job.  So, now, with a very soft product, I got a spoon and tasted it.  It was *so* gritty!  And it stuck to the roof of my mouth worse than peanut butter.<br /><br />I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WV153I"">Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Butter -- 16 oz</a>, which is slightly softer and has absolutely no gritty feel -- and the Artisana doesn't stick to the roof of my mouth either.",0

"My cat prefers incline scratchers and will definitely still go for carpets and chairs if I don't have an alternate close by so this seemed to fill the bill (at first) at a good price.  However, I second many of the other reviewers. .. It is light weight so, as someone else suggested, I put a few weights inside to stablize it.  My puss IMMEDIATELY pulled out the suspended paper ball (NOT a little mouse toy as pictured) and IMMEDIATELY shredded it...so much for that aspect.  I also used transparent packing tape to reinforce the whole thing since it seemed to be tearing slightly at the folds from heavy use (the good thing).<br /><br />IF you can order this so that the shipping is free, and if you just want another scratcher to place around the house to keep your puss off furniture scratching..this is a good price vs retail (Target for instance) for this kind of thing.  Its the least ugly of the products that provide unobtrusive scratch pads...I keep searching around  for an alternate that looks a bit better before I'd buy it again though.  Just quite flimsy ...so there's nothing special about getting this through Amazon (the price IS a bit better but not that much)..so sorry about that though.  I was quite hopeful this was 'the one'...for cheap, serviceable, and least ugly.  Close but not a winner.",0
"I like the food cube except it's not as indestructible as I had hoped.  I have four dogs and I bought this toy to see if I could curb my lab mix from her destructiveness due to mild separation anxiety.  Well, one of the other dogs figured it out first and taught her, the only problem is that the other dog also figured out how to pick the cube up to get it out of corners and this broke one of the plastic tabs inside that help you screw on and off the lid by pick it up with one canine in the hole and the other on the outside edge of the cube.  My 40lb dog broke the tab so what's going to happen if I were to let the 100 pounder play with it?  Thought this would be more like a Kong and less like rawhide that is easily destroyed.",0

And it seems awfully sweet for a ""health"" drink, although seeing cane sugar as the second ingredient on the list maybe explains that.<br /><br />Overall I would say this tea is probably pretty good.  I am a believer in Aloe Vera, but I found the taste a little too sweet at first.  After putting the bottle down for a day, putting in the refrigerator, and trying it again, it tasted better.  But I still didn't really like the taste all that much.  It was just a bit too thick and too sweet for tea for me.",0
It has a good texture and flavor. A little sweet but not bad. Could have a little more heat. I would buy it again.,0
"I love dark chocolate, but these were a little dark for me -- no sweetness to them at all.  The crunch was really nice, like eating chocolate-covered peanuts.<br /><br />Beware... I don't know what it was. I ate only one cluster and there was a rock-hard soy bean(?) in it.  I'm not sure if it was a bean from an earlier stage in the process (are they ever rock-hard?) or if it was indeed a small round stone.  I'll be eating the rest of them with care, so I don't break a tooth.<br /><br />I couldn't decide between three and four stars.  They taste okay, I'd like them to be sweeter (but then they wouldn't be as healthy), but the fact that I found something that could have broken a tooth in my first bite is a pretty big deal.  Since no other reviewer mentioned finding anything like that, I'm really hoping it's a one-time thing.  Consider it 3.5 stars.",0

"I'll start this by stating that I've never been much of a tea drinker.  When I do have tea, I find myself consciously criticizing it as being too weak.  I've always left tea bags or loose tea to steep far longer than most, and for tea bags, I've always used a spoon to squeeze any remaining ""concentrate"" from the bag in my attempt to make it as strong as possible.  Seeing the Red Espresso peaked my interest, particularly because I recently splurged on a semi-automatic espresso maker, which does everything automatically except for steaming the milk.<br /><br />I was certainly surprised by the smell upon opening the bag; it was a strong smell, not pleasant, but was similar to an odor of laundry that's been forgotten for days in the washer.  Fortunately, this isn't highly apparent in the finished product.  My automatic espresso maker requires the use of an override function when using pre-ground coffee, or in this case, tea.  One limitation to using the override feature is the somewhat limited quantity of powder that can be used - about 2 tablespoons full.  I've found my machine doesn't make good espresso with this little coffee, so was curious how the tea would come out.<br /><br />Following the instructions, I brewed several shots, using the water quantity as the variable.  The first shots were weak and tepid, similar to the few coffee shots I've tried to product from pre-ground coffee.  When pulling back on the water to about half, I was able to get quite strong and flavorful shots of tea, which has a nice rich taste to it.  Everyone's preference varies, and I'm sure my taste in tea would probably be too strong for a usual tea drinker, but the ability to vary the water is the key to success for not brewing weak tea.  I tried Red Espresso without milk, with milk, without Equal, and with Equal.  I think my favorite was one of the shots pulled with minimal water (strong), with a little milk and about 1/2 of an equal packet.<br /><br />After trying this tea I can't say I'm one of the new consumers, and I believe the limitations of my espresso maker may have caused some of the poor results I experienced.  The machine I have is designed with the principle of fresh grinding beans, a good tamp, and plenty of extraction.  Despite my efforts, I wasn't able to get full extraction from this tea, and being my first experience with espresso tea, I'm not sure if there is something I could have done to extract more.  I give it 3 stars.",0

I thought this product would be more like bread...but its so sweet.  They have added so much extra sweetener for no reason.  I think if it was not sweet it would be more verstile to use.<br /><br />Only use is for sweet breads but not for savory breads or all the non sweet itms,0
"I have been using Torani Sugar Free (Splenda based) syrups for a while and I really like the Chocolate and Hazelnut flavors, so I thought I would try the Peppermint.  I make iced coffee at work - coffee over ice with some milk and a shot of Torani for sweetener.  I recently bought the three pack of Peppermint and I have to say: it's very strong.  The peppermint flavor can easily overwhelm the coffee or the flavor of the milk.  I'm not saying it's bad, per se, but it's quite a bit of flavor and I don't really want to overwhelm the flavor of the coffee.  So I think for mornings where I want the peppermint flavor, it'll be a very small shot of the peppermint, and a packet of regular splenda to add more sweetener.  I might normally use 2 teaspoons of the chocolate or hazelnut but I think that's too much with the peppermint.  Torani makes these in plastic bottles - good for shipping, and don't break if you drop them.",0

At least I can take comfort in the fact that I never have to go to Starbucks anymore though.",0
"This review is for Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). The packaging for this shipment was appropriate, as was the actual bag containing the ground coffee, which included a way for re-sealing to maintain freshness.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee, which is really the most important factor, I was not that fond of the vanilla aspect of the flavor. I'm not certain why, but vanilla in Coffeemate tastes fine to me, but the vanilla 'infusion' into this coffee simply tasted too artificial for my palate, even when adding a non-flavored creamer. My advice is to add flavor to your coffee, if desired, only after the brewing process.",0

The can is small and cylindrical, like an energy drink, but there's nothing in this to give you a ""boost"".  FYI, there are 140 calories in one can.

"I never use the whole sauce packet, there's some fish sauce in it that just overwhelms the whole bowl with a salty taste I don't like. If I use 1/2 or less of the sauce packet it doesn't overwhelm the dehydrated veggies, and is ok - not my favorite though.",0

"As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a ""subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma"".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less ""subtle flavor.""",0

"While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.",0

"I have colored, heat damaged hair, so a good conditioner is a must. With 2 weeks of use, Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Conditioner had absolutely no effect on my hair. While it had a pleasant scent, the conditioner itself didn't seem to do anything.<br /><br />It didn't coat my hair well like other conditioners and didn't leave my hair soft once I had washed it out. My hair remained rough and tangled-feeling, about the same as after shampooing but before conditioning. Once dry, my hair seemed to have even less volume than it usually does (which isn't much to begin with). The lack of volume may have been because I needed to use a conditioning spray to get a hairbrush through my hair after using this conditioner that may have weighed it down.<br /><br />This conditioner didn't damage my hair, but it didn't help it any either. I needed to use more product to keep from damaging it by using a brush while it was wet than I would have normally had to use with a different conditioner, so I found no benefit to using this product.

It's not amazing in flavor or tenderness but it's very edible and still delicious. This doesn't have a real salty flavor some brands do and it doesn't have a very smoky flavor either. It's good to see a little bag of mid-priced jerky. Most jerky here is $4.50-$9 a package.<br /><br />My favorite jerky that's the most tender and has the best taste is made by a company in Sonoma, California called Krave Jerky. That company's Basil Citrus jerky is the best I've ever had!!<br /><br />Matador jerky is 3 stars.",0
The product came in a timely manner but it did not come with all the types of skittles there was no tropical skittle in the one i recieved. There was also and abundence of Regular skittles well very few of the others.,0
Have had both the tom yum soup and the kimchee soup.  The flavor is quite good but the odor is rather strong so may not be ideal for having at the office.,0
"This company shipped quickly and packaged item well.  Unfortunately, all of the boxes opened so far, 9 out of 12 have had 1/3 to 1/2 of the chocolates melted in it.  Perhaps this happened because of the package sitting in the delivery truck until it got to me.  I am not sure how it happened, yet it is dissapointing which is why I give them an overall score of 3. When melted, the chocolates are sticky and at times difficult to separate in order to eat.  In our case, the mint melted out the top of the chocolate squares and connected all the melted mints together. We love them so much that we ate them this way even though it isn't as enjoyable as when they are unmelted.  Unlike in previous reviews, our chocolates were within the use by date by a few months and taste just fine.",0
"The gum is not a solid ""barrel"" shape although the packaging makes it appear to be the same.  There are ridges in the gum and thus it does not make a full piece of gum.  I contacted Dubble Bubble thinking they changed the product and I was told that ""the retailer requested"" the gum to be like that--Dubble Bubble did not change their product otherwise.  The flavors are still the same and good.",0
"Dog enjoyed it. I did not enjoy, however, being in the same room with said dog afterwards. Is it the soy? Phew. My dog is gassy if she eats the wrong kibble.<br /><br />This has a lot of corn as well. And wheat. There are nice ingredients (beef, potatoes, green beans) but there is also poulty by-product meal and...yeah, corn. Which makes it cheaper. Sorry, dog, this won't be on the menu again any time soon.<br /><br />Ingredients: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, choline chlo",0
"I wanted something that didn't have soy in it so I gave these a shot.  I didn't know what to expect ""lookswise"" with these bars.  There are little pellets of what I guess is rice bound together with something really sticky and sweet that holds the cashews and cranberries.<br /><br />The taste is really good, the cashews are big and tasty.  But it is way too sweet (7 gms sugar) for me.  It is also very stick so if you have bridgework be careful.  Half way through my jaw was already sore from chewing so much.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll finish them but won't reorder.",0
"I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.",0
Will not order again and may not finish the ones I have here. These are not bad but just not very good either. I compare these to Bugles chips in taste. Do yourself a favor and buy 1 bag locally 1st before buying a case online and then not wanting to finish the bag let alone the whole case.,0
"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.",0
"Im nibbling one on of these as I'm typing.  I like the taste, chocolatey, nutty, a standard 1.8 oz weight, long flat shape.<br /><br />However, the downside of these bars.  While it's a good taste, it's just simply not that filling.  The consistency is very light.  The light and airy taste doesn't leave me very satisfied after I've eaten it -- I want more substance.",0

I ordered a case of this peanut butter in chocolate and regular.  The chocolate has a funny taste and it's going to waste.  The original is pretty good but too salty.  I won't order this again.,0
"The popcorn is ok, but I've had trouble getting it to pop anywhere near completely in my old microwave.",0
"If you are hoping to buy the same product you enjoyed in France this is not the one for you.  The price is OK, I subscribed to get the best price, yet this product compares with any ""butter cookie"" found here. Just ""so so"".",0
"I like all halo products but this canned cat food is just a little too soupy.  My cats look at me with ""What's this?"" .<br />They like a little something to chew on.",0
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.,0
LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT IT IS SO OVERPRICED LIKE EVERYTHING AWESOME FROM JAPAN!<br />5* flavor. but only 1* for price and value.,0
"It really doesn't ""fit in"" anywhere. I can't imagine this processed stuff is going to be better for you than natural spices or peppers. Its kind of zippy but I felt there was a strange after taste. I can't describe as anything more than ""artificial"".<br /><br />It tastes ok and puts a little zip into an otherwise bland meal.<br /><br />I wouldn't go overboard with it.<br /><br />I prefer tabasco & natural peppers & spices to this.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.",0
"This is good popcorn, but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would.",0
"Had this been labeled ""green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence"" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.",0
"Sorry to see this product was made in China. After the discovery of the bad dog food from China in addition to other things (lead paint in children's toys), I don't feel completely confident that these treats are not harmful.",0
"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One ""stick"" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.",0
"This product is a VERY light roast.  I suppose my not being such a huge fan of this product is due to my own poor research prior to ordering, but I doubt I'll purchase this item again.  The coffee is *ok* but definitely nothing I'm doing backflips over.  The body is far lighter than I would've anticipated or desired.  The aroma isn't bad, though I can't say it seems as fresh as would be desired, either.  All together I'd say this was decidely mediocre.<br /><br />I should also include, though, that I use a Keurig coffee maker, with one of the refill-able baskets (I love the k-cup varieties, but they get to be too expensive for every day use, when you consume as much coffee as I do).  Perhaps this would be a more enjoyable blend if used in a traditional coffee pot, where you have the ability to overload the filter with grounds.  That being said, clearly this is not the coffee for me.",0
This product was to big for my dogs and will not purchase again just due to size the product is fabulous and my dogs love the medium size.,0
"The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!",0
"While this is a good mustard oil, we found the flavor to be milder than another brand we purchased last year.  We really liked the stronger flavor.  Unfortunately, we don't remember what the other brand was.  If you prefer a mild flavor you can consider this to be a five-star review instead of three-star.",0
"So some people didn't like that weird feeling the chocolate left in your mouth that people mentioned as a ""waxy"" feeling, but I personally enjoyed the taste of this a lot, and I bought this quite a bit until I realized there's trans-fat in the cereal.<br /><br />In the ingredients, the cereal contains ""PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL"", which for those who may not know, but anything ""hydrogenated"" contains a very small amount of trans-fat.<br /><br />It may only be less than .5 grams and so in the nutrition panel, they can show that there's 0 trans fat in the cereal, but if you had 3-4 servings of chocolatey delight, you could very well be eating 1-2 grams of trans-fat. Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Anyways, give the cereal a try if you haven't, and don't just think you'll hate the taste of it just because others didn't like the taste of it because I enjoyed the flavor of the cereal very much.",0
"I think the idea that there aren't any artificial flavoring or nitrates in this beef jerky is more appealing than the taste.  It is definitely an acquired taste, but once you get used to it, it isn't so bad.  It'll take care of your jerky craving.  Once warning of note, the bag will mold after you open it, so make sure you finish it off pretty quickly.  I realized the bag of mold only after I took a bite.  Didn't kill me, so now I have an immunity to something out there, just not sure what.",0
"To be honest, I was hoping for the results that some women that reviewed these pills had.  I think that I had some milk increase, but nothing like what I had read on most of the reviews.  I tried pumping every two hours after returning to work and would be lucky if I pumped 2-2.5oz total from both breasts. I thought that meant that I had a milk supply problem, so I started taking Fenugreek.  When I first started taking the pills I was only taking two, twice a day.  That seemed to help a little and the morning pump I was pumping about 4oz each breast.  I slowly increased the amount of pills I was taking but it didn't seem to increase my milk supply.  I pump twice a day now and get anywhere from 10-12oz total for the day...that might get my baby through one day at day care.<br /><br />I think that this just works differently for different people.  I did notice that when I sweat I smelled like maple syrup, but that has since decreased and I don't notice it anymore.  I might have become more gassy, but it never affected my baby in a negative way...she has always remained a happy baby whether I'm taking it or not.  I'm still taking the pills a few times a day and just pump twice a day for whatever I can get.  I have started supplementing my baby (now almost 5 months) to start weaning.<br /><br />I would recommend Fenugreek if you think that your milk supply is low and you need a boost...it doesn't seem to hurt to try it.  I wished that I would have gotten what other women got, pumping 8-10oz per breast every pump...but alas I wasn't that lucky!",0
"This trap is made for ""minnie mole"", or ""Geo the gopher"". You know the tiny chevrolet Geo?<br />Honestly, don't think it will work for me 'cause I actually saw the one that has taken up residence in my front, and back yard, and he aint that small. I should refer to him as a ground hog instead :) Maybe this trap will catch something roaming around, that doesn't belong.... If it does catch gargantuan gopher I'll report back.<br /><br />Sorry to say the lever let me down. The lever on the trap has to be set on the edge of the hook for it to work. I even decided to dig the trap up, because I noticed that overnight, still had no catch, but the bait was gone. I wiggled the hook, this thing did not even budge. So I am assuming that the hook on my trap is bent too far closed. Washed it, and disinfected it, and sent it back. I am trying the huge rat trap with bait, then I'll report back with my results.",0
"It's a good idea, but my dog did not get it at all.  It's design is like a roll on deoderant - the ball inside moves while licked putting more of the liquid flavor onto the ball and into the dogs mouth.  You can ration how much the dog licks and put the lid back on.<br /><br />The smell wasn't strong unless you put your nose on it for a big whiff.  It must have smelled good to my dog because she went nuts over it.  The problem was it was too small and she kept bitting it and trying to yank it from my hand.  Then later when I was gone - she got it off the counter and chewed through it.  Yes, I know - she wasn't well behaved with it.  BUT she couldn't resist the temptation and after I had let her lick it I guess she figured it was fair game.<br /><br />Overall - I believe it's made for a little dogs but I didn't know that when I got it.",0
"This is a good product, BUT, buy the larger bags.  They are the better value.  These are excellent for anyone who must limit their salt intake.",0
Boutght both frech vanilla and the caramel macchiata(sp).  Not eh caramel cam in 6 boxes of 24.  The french vanilla came in a bag! Just a plastic bag! Some of them were busted and leaking probably from shipping. I don't understand why the caramel ones come in boxes of 24 but the french vanilla comes in a bag? *shrugs*  I like the flavor just didn't like the way they shipped it.,0
"Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.",0
"If you are looking for a BOLD k-cup, try the Coffee People ""black tiger"" or their ""french roast"" bold... they are about the closest thing to a cup of Starbucks that you can get in a k-cup.  This is fine if you like Green Mountain, McDonalds, or Dunkin' Doughnuts coffee.  It has a classic GM slight nutty/sweet taste that I am not overly fond of but it is okay for an evening cup or when you are in the mood for something lighter.",0
I guess these bars are what they claim they are.  But the taste and consistency leaves something to be desired.  Did keep me from being hungry. I would buy again if they were on some super sale but not worth the regular price at least for me.,0
"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.",0
"All of the Kitchens of India products (and in fairness all ready to eat Indian Curries) are loaded with sodium. This particular product has over 800 mg per serving. Each packet is supposed to serve two! I eat one pack as a single person. I have read several people who claim to eat the entire package individually. In effect you are ingesting ~1650 mg of sodium with a single package. The latest recommended FDA sodium levels have been reduced to 1500 mg per daily to avoid heart issues apart from other potential issues. While this product does taste great and is good for busy single people who cannot spend time cooking, it is going to kill you sooner than otherwise. So enjoy the taste as long as you are willing to die sooner as well....",0
"This is decent tasting.  The cottage cheese leaves a lot to be desired.  It picks up the sauce color all the way through, looking grayish brown.  Rubbery texture.  No worse than other brands in that respect.  Not really a Korma in my opinion, more like a curry.  Given what's available locally, i would not buy this again.",0
I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.,0
"I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the ""organ"" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!",0
"I am not sure how to rate this food. It is definitely better than any of the cheap foods I was feeding my cats before the great pet food recall scare. My cats seem healthy enough (though one of my three cats is trying very hard to be obese... just bought the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station to help her loose weight). I have been feeding them Solid Gold for three years now and would have gone on feeding them this forever had I not switched my cat litter from Fresh Step clumping to a non-clumping natural variety and realized my cats have very smelly runny poo. Obviously something in this food is not being digested by my cats. So I took a closer look at the ingredients and began to wonder if the ""grain-free"" idea Solid Gold employs is a great hoax. I mean, how much more nutritious is the potato in Solid Gold as a source of carbs than corn or rice? Also, though the analysis lists this food at 45% protein, the third ingredient that goes into it is potato protein. How much of the 45% protein is from chicken and how much from potato?<br /><br />I have decided I am going to switch my cats to Blue Bufflao when my current bag of Solid Gold is over. Because, though I have taken only one nutrition course, I instinctively know that a bowl of rice is indeed more nutritious than a bowl of potato. Hopefully Blue Buffalo will be easier on their digestive systems too. Apparently Wysong has a ""starch free"" formula but it is way more expensive.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list. The second and third ingredients are potato.<br /><br />Solid Gold Indigo Moon ingredients: Chicken Meal, potatoes, potato protein, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) , Chicken, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ocean Fish Meal, Salmon Oil (source of DHA), Dried Chicory Root, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Parsley Flakes, Pumpkin Meal, Almond Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Sesame Oil (preserved by mixed tocopherols), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Thyme, Blueberries, Cranberries, Carrots, Broccoli, Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Calcium Panthothenate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Sodium Selenite, Vitamin D Supplement, Folic Acid<br /><br />Update 10/29/2011: Just wanted to let everyone know that the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station is the best thing ever invented for chubby cats. My three cats are eating half what they used to! Which means they are pooping less too, which is kinda awesome. Still trying to finish my bag of Solid Gold though. I keep dry food in a big airtight pail and it stays fresh forever.<br /><br />Update 11/19/2011: Managed to find Wysong Epigen at pretty much the same price as Soild Gold and with free shipping on orders over 50 dollars. Search wag.com<br /><br />Update 12/20/2011: Wysong Epigen is amazing! My cats are shedding their excess weight and running around like little energetic crazies. They don't seem to be eating as much of it as they used to Solid Gold. To touch it doesn't seem greasy like Solid Gold did. PLUS their poo has solidified! Yay! All three of my cats are FIV+ and I am confident a good diet will help them live longer, happier lives.",0
"This tea has a really bad taste to it, bought it for weight loss, it didn't help. had all the other teas dr oz recommended too. no weight loss, in fact i think i gained weight while drinking teas all through the day as suggested by dr oz. but you have to remember that caffeine makes your pancreas put out more insulin which in turn makes you hungry :(",0

"I drank a bottle of blk in the dark so that the color wouldn't influence my opinion. First thing I noticed was a slightly bitter taste. It wasn't so bad and I drank most of a 16.9 oz bottle with no problem. There was a slight after taste as well. If the health benefits of this drink are real, I think they need to do something with the formula to make it more appealing to a larger mass of people. I like sparkling mineral water and I drink it because it contains those trace minerals that some bottled waters lack, and because I can still get some bubbles and not have all the sugar found in soda. I'm not 100% sure of the health benefits. Maybe offering a sparking version of this with some natural flavor like lemon would make this more appealing. I can understand the aversion that some people have. Dark, like a cola, yet a little bitter like hard water. It's a little confusing to the senses.",0
"These are really DRY.  Good with a cup of coffee in the morning.  The flavor is OK, not too sweet.  Not enough cinnamon.  I would not buy them again.",0

"I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.",0
"I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.",0

I upped my rating a star. Everything was smaller than it looked... it was nicely packed... the soap was in the shape of a honey comb, all items had a bear theme with honey and almonds. Was OK, and she said she liked it, but she loved her other items more... It was ok as part of a barrage of gifts... Remember...If your ""honey"" aint happy, aint nobody happy:)",0
"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.",0

In all fairness this is the first time I've had a problem with the Chicken & Mackerel.  I'm hoping I just received a bad batch.  Watery consistency and chunks of darker meat which I can't quite make out.  Pet Food Direct contacted by Nature Organics and was told that there hasn't been a recipe change so I'm going to give it one more chance since this is my cats' favorite flavor.  Pet Food Direct customer service was great in that they refunded the three cases I had purchased.,0

I notice they come in the tiny squares...that way...maybe not much would be there to crumble in shipping.  I'm going to order for the first time.  I forgot to question about the shelf life. I look forward to tasting them.  Thanks to all of you.",0
"I exercise regularly.  During summer, scalp can easily dry out after extensive sweating.  I always like to give my hair and scalp extra treatment.  For one, I dye my hair and since I wash it every day, I like to give it extra moisture whenever possible.  The latest rave for hair care is argan oil.  This product contains argan in addition to many other minerals and oils.  Instructions for the product indicate that this hair oil is helpful to soothe hair and it can be used on both wet and dry hair.<br /><br />I used this oil on my wet hair.  I left it on my hair overnight.  In the morning, my hair had ""wet"" look.  My advice is if you are planning to leave this product in your wet hair overnight, you may consider washing it again in the morning.  For that reason, I would use this product on the weekend as extra care for hair and scalp.  If you intend to use this product on a dry hair, use just a little bit of it to smoothe hair after using hair dryer,  It will nourish the ends and smooth frizzy hair.  This is very helpful if you live in a humid climate.<br /><br />Bottle is fairly small, 3 oz size.  For that reason, it is also convenient for travel.  One can pack it easily if one goes on vacation.  If you are swimming in the ocean, pool or just spendign a lot of time in the sun without covering your hair and scalp, this product is perfect for a little extra care.",0
"Obviously this company is off-loading its dented cans via internet shoppers.  Out of twelve cans I received, only one was in pristine condition.  Three of them were severely dented to the point that I would never have bought them if I had been at my local grocery store. I don't think the seals have been compromised but it is borderline.  The other eight cans all have small dents and scuffs as if they had been dropped at some point- cosmetic damage only.  I am happy to have the product as my local grocery stores are having trouble getting canned pumpkin and I am craving some pumpkin pie, but I think Osbo should disclose the fact that it is selling dinged cans and not send the really bad ones at all.  I will avoid this company in the future because of this lack of disclosure.",0
"So I've been trying to lose weight & eat healthier.  I saw these on the Early Show & thought ""wow! Crackers for only 12 calories? This would make the perfect snack to keep me from eating all day!""  The talk show host tried one & was saying how much he liked them so I figured they couldn't be all that bad...well, after tasting them I think he's full of you-know-what!  They are VERY dry & flavorless & not in a good way.<br /><br />I thought they would be a little less tasty than the high fiber crackers at the store, but no...they're way worse, but I guess that should be expected at just 12 calories.  First I tried them with laughing cow blue cheese & the flavors didn't go well at all.  Then I tried them with veggie dip (made with 16oz light sour cream & 1 pack of Cugino's veggie weggie dip mix).  This was at least edible.  I have some PB2 on order to try it with & update my review if it's better.<br /><br />Right now, I wouldn't buy them again, but at least I only paid $6.69 for a 5-pack through Amazon with subscribe & save & a $3 coupon.",0
"I am a HUGE fan of the celestial seasonings cool brew iced teas. This is my least favorite flavor. It is very weak in flavor compared to the other. However, I still order it just to have a variety.",0
This product worked beautifully after I spent about 45 minutes trying to get all of the 1 and 2 inch lumps out!!  I don't know how long this sugar had been sitting in the warehouse or what weather conditions it was exposed to but I made this purchase anticipating a finely powdered fondant sugar and what I got was very hard lumps that had to be broken up before they could even be sifted!,0
"The product works & tastes just fine, but the packaging was terrible.  Two out of the three containers was broken open during xhipping.  The containers should have been packed more securely so they couldn't move or get crushed.",0
"This is a great product.  Keeps my dog's skin allergies under control.  I used this for a year until the price went wayyyyy up.  It has no corn, wheat, or junk, so the increase in the cost of the ingredients cannot be because of the corn shortage.  It went up from $37 to 46.  crazy for 30 pounds of dog food.  southern states coop makes an identical one which is 40 pounds for $30 and they often have coupons for their store.  I switched.  no brainer.",0
"First off, let me say that this shampoo smells fantastic and has great lather - two things that I value in a shampoo. Unfortunately, this shampoo has also left my hair a bit dry and without shine. I have color treated hair, and do not typically use a shampoo for color treated hair, since I find that the extra moisturizers in shampoos designed specifically for color treated hair tend to weigh my hair down. I typically purchase shampoos that are supposed to add volume, since I also have very thick hair that tends to get helmet-like if I don't use a volumizing shampoo. But apparently, this shampoo is not moisturizing enough for my hair type. So, if you have color treated hair that tends to get dry, I would suggest another shampoo or another brand.",0
"Considering I am a huge dark chocolate fan--and I don't mean the Hershey's dark chocolate. I typically like to eat chocolate with 65-70%  cocoa content, and was excited to see the dark chocolate cookies. I tried them and actually (sort-of) liked them at first. The taste was not sweet, but not bitter either. However, after eating a few of them, I had to admit to myself that they just weren't anything special. I tried to give them away at an office party and absolutely no one wanted to take them home after tasting one. I had essentially purchased a case of cookies that I couldn't give away. I typically don't ever leave reviews that are negative; if I don't like something, I just don't review it. However, I tried several other Late July products because I liked the company's stance on many (food-related) issues, and they all left me feeling that same Blah. While others may enjoy these cookies, I just can't recommend them. If you're looking for great-tasting, organic cookies, try Country Choice (also available on Amazon). They are vegan and delicious.",0
"I was a bit concerned as the jerky had an odd odor not present in canine caviar products I had bought before, but they looked fine and my dog enjoyed them, so maybe it was just because they had been packed in an airtight package for shipping.  This product is WAY too expensive, but my dog really enjoys it.",0
"My dog used to really like these, but I can't give them to her anymore because I'm afraid they're poisoned by the Chinese. The Chinese poison dog food you know. Anyway, I used to feed them to her all the time, until the Chinese started poisoning the food. Then I was afraid. I decided that I would have to test all the food before I gave it to my dog. I tried one of these and it made me really sick. I didn't feel well at all so I knew it was poisoned. Now I don't feed them to her anymore. Now all I feed her are Pillsbury Croissants. She really seems to like them a lot. Of course, I still test them before giving them to her. They all seem OK, I would recommend feeding them to your pet. The only peoblem is that she seems to be gaining quite a bit of weight.",0
"This product is a pretty DECENT product.  I was expecting a much better cup of coffee.  I purchased this along with ""Cafe Altura Organic Peruvian Dark"" and the other coffee was much better.  In fact it was also a 1/3rd of the price.  If I did a blind taste test I think the majority of the participants would select the peruvian dark.",0
"This gum has very good flavor, but it only lasts about a minute. However, I can chew this gum for hours without it dissolving like other gums. High quality ingredients, just wish the flavor lasted longer.",0
"By the look of it, it looks like a round item.  It wasn't.  It was just like a little cap.  BTW, it also didn't last as long as I thought it would.  My pomeranians grinded it down in 3 hours.<br /><br />But to its defense, they did seem to love it.  So, I recommend it...just know that it won't last long.",0
"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.",0
Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth.,0
"Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not ""coconut milk,"" although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.)<br /><br />Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called ""the tree of Life,"" because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.<br /><br />Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.<br /><br />Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign.<br /><br />For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.<br /><br />It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard.<br /><br />Don't be misled by the ""100% Natural"" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is ""USDA Organic,"" for example. Virtually anything found in ""nature,"" i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered ""natural"" and can legally be included in a product labeled ""100% Natural."" Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing.<br /><br />While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is, I can only give it 3 stars and a serious ""caveat emptor."" It is probably much better than any ordinary ""sports drinks,"" but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. One's health is not something to be treated lightly.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2009:<br /><br />After continued searching, I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing, harvesting, or other relevant details of production, neither do any of their competitors.<br /><br />So far, this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find, and I continue to drink it, even with the questions I have.",0
I like this stuff because it doesn't taste awful and it has the equivalent effect on my body that fiber powder would have on most people. I do feel more calm and sleepy however I Can't sleep when I take it. So if I take it in the am I'm tired but if I take it in pm I can't sleep. I also get cramps because its doing something to my digestive system.,0
"These gumballs have an awesome flavor, similar to Juicy Fruit, however it lasts about five minutes and then it's gone. They were fresh and soft. The image shows a 6 ounce package but they are 4.5 ounce bags. Overall, not a bad product but I will not be a repeat customer with the flavor not lasting long enough. Also, if you are watching calories beware, a serving is one gum ball at a whopping 126 calories!",0

"I buy these in the store and they are usually delicious. I was looking for an economic alternative to purchasing this product. This would be a good deal if the bags did not expire next month and in the two bags that have been opened so far, the chips are over cooked. They are still okay, but not as good as I have had in the past. So overal I am disappointed with this purchase.",0
I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  I'll be going back to Emeril's Jazz'd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee People's French Roast Decaf.  So far I've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee don't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you'd probably enjoy this one.,0
"The Mestemacher Organic Sunflower Seed bread, has a good flavor, but is difficult to work with, when trying to toast it and put butter, jam or whatever, on it.  It falls apart easily.<br />The slices have to be cut in half to put in the toaster.  There is not very much bread in a loaf, for the price paid.  I am not going to order that bread again.  I prefer the Flax Seed bread!",0
"We have a SodaStream soda/seltzer maker, and I bought the Torani Sugar-Free Black Cherry syrup with the hope that it would be a nice complement to SodaStream's flavor lineup, which is missing flavors we really like, like Diet Cherry Zero, or Diet Cherry Dr. Pete (Dr. Pepper). The cherry flavor is there with this syrup, but we find the syrup is not rounded out to be quite sweet enough. And no matter what sweetness, we always experience a bitter aftertaste. What we find is that using a little Equal to offset the aftertaste and enhance the sweetness will help, but of course, that is no good for phenylketonurics. We'll keep looking.",0

"My 10 year old son loves chocolate but wasn't particularly impressed by these cookies. For a Chips Ahoy product, they are good, but there's still a ""manufactured cookie"" quality to it, versus a small batch or homemade quality. The base cookie is not dry, but spongey. There are 2 kinds of chips that have a nice sweet taste that go good together. The main issue I found is the claim it is gooey. I think that's an overstatement. While there is a small amount of fudge goo in the middle, it doesn't make the whole cookie gooey. If anything, a moderate sensation of gooeyness is produced once you chew the entire cookie in your mouth, but it's nowhere near, say, a chocolate fudge brownie. These are more light and soft, not thick and gooey.",0
"After reading all the ""healthy benefits"" of using flaxseed, I bought this product to add to my morning smoothie.  Like all healthy products you buy them with high expectations but I personally can't see any change.  It does mix well in my smoothie and I'll continue to purchase this product. Not knocking flaxseed...it's just another health food to add to your diet. As I get older I continue to eat healthier and that's got to be a good thing.",0
"I love to eat sunflower seeds and in recent years have tried to stay away from the salted variety.  I ordered these seeds for the first time about 4 weeks ago and was disappointed with the taste.  They are not roasted (apparently) and to me taste funky.  The seeds are nice-sized and plump, but I will be tossing them to the pigs tomorrow.",0

I've had Stash English breakfast Tea several times. But it has been about two years now since I had it so I ordered 100 from Amazon. I don't know if I got a bad batch but the tea don't seem as good as it use to be. It tastes only a tiny bit better than say Tetley or Lipton. I remember it to be far superior. I just don't know. It's not stale because the expiration date is the end of 2014. I wish I picked another brand.,0
I love a really bold cup of coffee. I wish StarBuck would make pods.<br />I was disappointed with the Jet Fuel so I ordered the Bold Coffee variety pack.<br />For me the Black Tiger is better.<br />I will be ordering that one from now on.,0
It was tasty and good. Specially when microwaved ! But I think it's shouldn't be used as a everyday snack if your on a diet or trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Go for the grapes instead.,0
"I have purchased this cereal by the case for years because it is that good. When I ordered this at the end of February 2012, we thought I ordered the wrong thing as there was a definite change. Thinner flakes, less flavor, and not as sweet. Not that this cereal is very sweet anyway, but there was just a hint of sweetness that was perfect for eating without feeling the need to add any sugar to it. Why in the heck did they mess with perfection? Now it's just OK, nothing special. Might as well eat mostly flavorless Total because that's what it reminds me of now.",0
It took a lot of putzing and adjusting - and almost ruining an entire sheet (at $4 each for ONE - OUCH!) but now that I have the settings on my cricut cake mini machine - hopefully it'll be great from here on out! The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is the price and the fact that I bought a red and was very disappointed to open the package and its NOT a true red :( I'm hoping once I put it on the cake that'll change! (fingers crossed!!),0
"My family and friends tried this. Unfortunately no one seems to agree to buy this again. This is too spicy for most of kids. Some complained it tastes a bit artificial and less natural. Others claim is is a bit too heavy. Of course, each one has its taste, and we are a small sample, but even so our small feedback is not that positive on this one.",0

I can't judge it on how effective it is because you have to use 2 tablespoons of it a day as recommended for dogs over 60 lbs.  It's gross looking but she liked it okay.  Basically, it's not money well spent, unless you have a small dog.",0
"This is supposed to be ""Sweet & HOT"" beef jerky.  It's sweet, but it's not HOT.  It's not even hot.  If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.",0

"There are basically two ways to look at Kraft Mac and Cheese Veggie Pasta.  You can compare to to regular Mac and Cheese - it's healthier!  Or you can compare it to stuff in the produce aisle - it's processed crap disguised as health food!  Both approaches are valid.<br /><br />The cheddar cheese powder tastes great as always, and the new veggie noodles taste the same but smell slightly off.  The box helpfully informs you on the back that one serving of this stuff provides 1/10th of your recommended daily helping of veggies, but uses up 1/4th of your allowance of saturated fat and sodium and about 1/5th of your allowance of calories.  Actually, it doesn't tell you that in so many words, but that's what you'll find if you read between the lines.  Delicious yes, health food no.<br /><br />In the end this is just a gimmick product to charge more for.  For some reason the price of Kraft 50% Whole Wheat Mac and Cheese remains about double the price of regular Mac and Cheese, and it looks like Veggie Pasta will hold to that strategy too.<br /><br />My advice: stock up on regular old Kraft Mac and Cheese when it goes on sale, toss out the noodles and use the cheddar powder with store-brand 100% whole grain macaroni noodles.  Eat a couple carrots while the water boils, and you'll come out ahead on both price and nutrition.",0
"I've tried Douwe Egbert coffee in a restaurant before and it was great but not so much when making it at home. And mind you, I don't use regular drip, but French press.

"Lately, I've been trying a few different brands of coconut water drinks which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I find them quite refreshing and I like the high potassium content to balance the sodium in my diet. Well, tonight there was a new bran and it came in six packs of 10-ounce cans: Amy & Brian Coconut Juice. Hmmm, the others are listed as coconut water. Well, I had to try it. the can says all natural and lists young coconut water as the only ingredient. Strangely enough, the ingredients don't list the potassium content, a usual bragging matter for coconut drinks. Well, this coconut juice tastes somewhat sweet and a bit rich. In a slight way, it's almost a bit candy-like. It's a good juice, but I don't like it as well as several of the other lighter brands which I would regard as more refreshing. Probably, I won't be buying a second six pack. Some people may prefer the taste, so don't let my taste deter you.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",0
"Was doing the subscribe and save option when they still offered 4 boxes in each shipment for the same price they recently decided to start offering 3 boxes for.

I used it to sprinkle sugar on top of cookies and I had to sift it first, but there was still some clumps in the sifter.<br /> I also used it to make icing and that came out without clumps.  So, the sugars ok, but it's got to be sifted if you don't plan on mixing it with any liquids.",0
"I have bought these twice now. The first order was great, great flavor, crunchy, very fresh tasting. I was so impressed I quickly ordered a second batch. Since the first were so fresh, I figured they'd last awhile.<br /><br />The second batch was bad. Stale and not very crisp with a sort of mild chemical taste rather then that nice cheesy flavor. I had a hard time believing they were even the same product. I'm eating them slowly because I generally don't believe in wasting food that is edible, but I hesitate now to try other things.",0

"Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.",0
"Well, I purchased these thinking they'd be larger. It's a great price for 500 bags, but they're really pretty small. They can't hold more than about 25 jumbo popcorn pieces at a time. They're a little easy to rip and they just don't sit quite right, the bottom doesn't expand to make the bag a full rectangled shape as you'd expect. Weird, but affordable.",0
"We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!",0
"I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.",0

It is dangerous for me to buy them because my snacking can easily get out of control with them.<br /><br /> A 13.7 ounce box of Cheez-It was much bigger than I expected.<br /><br />The little crackers are crunchy and after you chew for a while they taste creamy but then very salty too. I checked the box, it only has 180mg of salt so why does it taste so salty. I checked the salt in the regular Cheez-it and it is 340 mg. I can't figure out. Why does a craker with much less sodium taste saltier than one that doesn't. I have to watch my sodium intake and sure enough, the next day my fingers were swollen and it was difficult to take off my ring.<br /><br />I had my husband taste it too and he thought the crackers tasted salty and sour.<br /><br />Occaisonally, I will brush off the salt all off the top of a cracker and offer it to my cockatiels. They tasted it and spit it out. Wise birds.<br /><br />Also, even though the box was packed with big air pillows, there was a lot crumbling in the last 1/3 of the box. Down there it was mostly crumbs.<br /><br />I would not buy it, I just don't like them.",0
"These crackers are delicious. They are a bit sweeter than I hoped for, but still, really tasty and crunchy. I try to wait until they get on sale to buy them - they are quite expensive.",0
Marginally better than Lipton. Don't think I will order it again. Came in a box and I was not really impressed with packaging either.,0
"After reading many pro and con reviews, I thought I'd try Walden Farms Pancake Syrup since being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes recently.  The taste is very mildly ""maple"" flavored....not bad, but I like more flavor.  It pours somewhat thickly and spread over things well.  I tend to pour more of this product than other low-carb syrups as they still have carbs that will add up fast into the ""significant carb count"" zone.  I pour more since it's sugar free, calorie free, fat free, and carb free, but if it's that free of anything then it must only be made from water plus lots of chemical stuff.  What I really do miss is regular syrup's sticky texture as you eat it with pancakes, French toast, or whatever.  I may not buy the product again, but it was worth a try.",0
"Great convenience, but I find I like a bit of salt to enhance the flavor.  Won't purchase this again.  Will try another brand which contains some sea salt, also available on amazon.",0
"I like this product, really I do.  Yes, I do notice that it acts like a little ""pick me up"" when I drink it.  Nothing drastic, but it's there and the feeling is pleasant.  Having said that, the price is just too much.  It's a drink, not medicine and I can probably find similar ingredients in a supplement for less money.  Drop the price, guys, and you will get more buyers!",0
"Pretty good, but I have to use much more than I would with starbucks coffee.  Starbucks bold roast coffees have a better taste anyways.  This coffee is bold enough if you use a lot, but there is nothing robust or flavorful about it.",0
"I enjoyed and quickly ate the Tuscan Almond and Southwest Cashew flavors of these nuts.  The flavor is quite strong, but good.  Lots of ""flavor powder"" coating every almond or cashew.  There was something about the Barbecue flavor that I don't care for, so those packages are still sitting around.  I'd give the Tuscan and Southwest flavors 5 stars... the Barbecue 2 stars.  (I do generally like Barbecue flavored products).",0
"I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.",0
Ok for the new cook. Seasoned cooks may find flavoring a bit flat.  Great if you're short on time. I used it on chicken that I baked.  May be better on pork (shake&bake style),0
"I really like these, however the youngsters didn't.<br />I didn't look at the price when I initally ordered them could have gotten them for less at the local store. They didn't taste fresh like those i have had in the past.",0
"I love this seasoning for almost anything on the grill...but the consistency was not what I'm used to with this. In the past it is always very smooth flowing...not all globed together like these bottles. So tired of having to return things and deal with the hassle, so I just mash it with a spoon before using :(",0
"I understand that being in a can can cause a tinny or weird aftertaste but I purchase other brands in cans and that aftertaste is not present. After I drink these, I won't be buying it again. The after taste is just a bit off.",0
"This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Black Cherry soda. It's got a pleasant taste just nothing that will blow you away. It's a bit expensive for such a small can and not a fresh enough idea to really get anyone to Switch from their current drinking habits.",0
"very disappointed....  I ordered 2 packages (20 straws). It was suppose to be a variety-instead they were mainly chocolate, very few vanilla, very few strawberry.<br />I assumed I would get an equal amount of each flavor.",0
"My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal.",0
"I do like this gift basket, my husband and I gave it to my sister-in-law as a gift. We did feel that it needed a few more items added to really give it a ""full"" look. We added some local chocolates and other treats. The packaging was very pretty and I do think that it would be a good gift for someone who you have trouble buying things for or to be shipped. I will consider buying other baskets from this company, but I may end up adding other items to make them a bit more personalized. :o)",0
"To be frank, I love the concept of the MIO Liquid flavors (I tried the Peach Tea), and really wanted to be able to give it 5 stars and recommend it to everyone, but it fell a bit short of that wish.<br /><br />The bottles are small and will fit in your purse or coat pocket really nicely (love this).  For me, a very small amount was more than enough for a strong glass of Peach Tea... the problem came when I drank the Peach Tea.  At first I loved the taste, but then the artificial sweet flavor took over and I ended up pouring it out.  Wanting to give the MIO Peach Tea Flavoring another chance, I even tried adding it to Club Soda as I love flavored seltzer waters.  I had the same problem - the sweet is still too artificial and really takes over.<br /><br />I think MIO is on the right track, but maybe instead of being 0 calories and using artificial sweeteners they could use REAL sugar and have a concentrated flavor without the sickeningly sweet fake/chemically taste.<br /><br />In short:<br />- Handy, compact size<br />- You choose how much to use, so you can vary the strength of your drink<br />- A little goes a long way<br />- Good alternative to plain drinks for some dietary concerns<br />- Initial taste is great, but then the artificial sweetness takes over",0
Lots of powdery stuff at bottom of package. Bananas were a bit soft and not very crunchy.,0
"This tea is not ""minty"" enough. I have Stash Peppermint tea bags and they are so much stronger.",0
"Got this as a present for my son for our Keurig. His only comment was that it tasted alittle sweeter than when he made regular Chai lattes for himself at home. At first I couldn't find it locally, that is why I ordered it from Amazon, but have found it now and a good bit cheaper  FYI.",0
"The flavor of this coffee is okay, but I felt it shouldn't be labeled as French Roast as it just doesn't have that deep roasted flavor that I love so much in a French Roast.  It's a much more mild, bland roast.",0
"I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I ""overcooked"" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order. I'll just make 2 at a time. In this case, I received 4 free, so it's hard to really complain all that much.",0
Wish there had been more recipes on the bag.  I have been adding sweet potato flour to recipes substituting it for some of the regular flour.  Works well but I'd  really like a recipe for sweet potato pancakes.,0
"This is the second time I've ordered these gummy eggs from this seller. The first time they were exactly as described! Delicious!  The second time I just hit the re-order button from the list of my previous orders.  They were good, but this time around they were 1/2 the sice and not the peach flavor described!",0
"This is a great buy especially when you calculate the ""per cup"".  However, The taste isn't quite as bold as I expected it to be and find myself ""choosing"" from my selection other brands.  This however is great for flavored coffee - adding a spoonful of chocolate for a mocha.",0
"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!",0
"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.",0
"Did not realize this was sugar free, must have missed that in description. I will give it to someone. disappointed!",0
"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",0
"This product was okay; in other words, it was edible. It was very reasonably priced. However, it was very greasy. I don't care for greasy foods. This is the first time I have ever purchased greasy jerky. I think my grandchildren liked it better than I did. They ate it up. However, I won't be purchasing it for personal consumption in the future.",0
I have been sampling a few k-cups and this is nothing special. I purchased this cheap in amazon warehouse deals.  Its decaf but has nothing special to it.  Id much rather have the Timothy's Colombian decaf but that can get pricy fast.<br />This is ok but more of a last resort. I do add some hot coco mix to it to fix it up.,0
"If someone tells you they drink this because they like the taste, they may not be telling the truth. I shared these with quite a few people, and the taste was never one of the good things people said about it. That doesn't mean that there aren't any good things about it, though.<br /><br />It contains some vitamins and minerals. A test at a university found that volunteers saw some improvements in body composition. It claims to burn 100 calories per can, and who can say it doesn't?<br /><br />It assures us that it works best (in its claims to increase muscle and lessen fat) with diet and exercise, and I'm sure that's true. None of the guinea pigs in my house noticed any effects, positive or negative, though we drank it before exercise as instructed.<br /><br />Here's what it does for sure: it gives you a kick of caffeine. If you prefer a sweet, cold drink to coffee or tea, then this is probably better for you than colas. If you start or end your day with a doughnut and coffee to get the caffeine/sweets combo, then this could be a more wholesome choice. And if you believe in it enough, it could encourage you to work out harder or longer, because faith can do wonders, and there are benefits to increasing exercise.",0
they are brown but when u start cooking them they turn black... not what I expected but at the end of the day I was happy with the product,0
"My kids have to eat gluten-free, so we're always interested in trying new Gluten-free products. They were excited about this one and they both loved the flavor. Personally, i thought it had a good vanilla flavor, but just as strong was the flavor of flax seed and cardboard. Bleh.<br /><br />It's also frustrating that it only has 2 grams of protein per serving. That is no where near enough to sustain kids for longer than a half hour, so in addition to the cereal i still have to fix them something else with protein in it! When will breakfast-makers realize that MORE protein is ESSENTIAL for the morning meal?? This is a constant gripe of mine though, and not exclusive to this product.<br /><br />I DO appreciate the high quality of the ingredients that ARE present in the cereal and the low amount of sugar in it.<br /><br />Overall, it is a quality product from a GOOD company. But while it has an ""okay"" flavor, it just doesn't have enough substance for me to buy it again for my family.",0
"I prefer a bold coffee.  This one has a nice flavor but is mild and weak.

"I've had this product several times.<br />When they're fresh and one is hungry they taste 'pretty good' but<br />reality sets in:<br /><br />They're greasy to the point of a scum of grease the roof of my mouth.<br />That's when I began to notice I really didn't like them.<br />They're really not tasty.<br /><br />I thought I liked the chocolate and the cookie but realized it's really<br />a terrible taste. It's thin (tasting) and simply lacks what you spend money<br />for.<br /><br />As another reviewer<br />said, ""The second order: The cookies tasted ..stale and had many broken cookies.<br />..these should not be seen as a healthy snack, as they still do have ...fats in them ..<br />nothing that's really good for you.""",0
"This is fairly standard British style Christmas cake, although to be honest it was a little too dry to be given any more stars. Acceptable but certainly not outstanding.",0
"Like other reviewers we found this Root Beer to be a very full flavor Diet soda that exceeded expectation.  My wife even got hooked and what started as a two case a month ""Subscribe & Save"" habit for myself over a year ago quickly turned to a five case a month subscription.  But wait, then we started to notice that there were subtle taste differences among the received cases, noticing an intermittent lack of full flavor we had become used to among some of the cans.  Then these taste variations became umpleasant in the last two months, experiencing a few flat tasting cans, but with many more cans that bordered on a sickly sour aftertaste almost like milk turning bad.  Checking the production number on the bottom of can was of no help because for every bad tasting can there was a good one with the same lot number.  Maybe it stems from variations among Amazon storage facilities as it seems our five cases are often mailed from different locations versus only a single one.  Bottom line, although the flavor again seems consistant with our last shipment of five cases we have decided to end our Subscribe & Save for this product because of all the previous wasted discarded product.  What a shame that there appears to be a quailty control issue for such a good product, whether is it at the production facility or at the storage facility I am unsure but it needs to be corrected.",0
"besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.<br /><br />now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars.",0
"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.",0
"After getting Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food I mixed it half and half with my dog's current food, just to avoid her getting the runs.  I could definitely tell she liked the new food since she seemed to be picking it out of her old food.  She has been eating the Costco brand salmon grain free food for years so this was a huge change for her since the second and third ingredient was some type of soy product.  However the most disturbing part is the oil.  I didn't realize it until after several pieces of kibble laid in my pantry for several days until I vacuumed it up and there were oil stains on my slate flooring.  Let me just say the Costco kibble doesn't do that.  We'll be sticking with the old brand of dog food for now, but my dog has appreciated a little variety in her diet the last few weeks.",0
The product taste good and everything is ok. But the shipper really ships too slow. Took 5 Days for them to ship out. And took 3 days to arrive and that is with 2 days prime. WTF?,0
"Honestly I love cashews however these are a bit too strong for my liking. As others have said, too much salt and way too much pepper! Still the nuts are crunchy and fresh although I can taste some suger on them.<br /><br />The pepper leaves a hot aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for several minutes. I ate a 4th of the can then had to get something to drink<br /><br />If you like pepper then these are for you. If not then maybe you should get something else instead...",0
"The description in the products listing says ""Blueberry Pomegranite"", but when you actually go into the item, it says ""Blackberry Pomegranite"".  I was not happy to get the Blackberry when I ordered the Blueberry, but the flavor was almost as good, so I kept it.  Will have to see what happens when my next Subscribe & Save order comes up.",0
"I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit. The other was very hesitant and didn't finish it. I won't buy this again.",0

"My honest opinion, beautiful, but strange tasting, and made me feel a little sick. They tasted good enough so that I ate five more quickly after eating the first, and did notice a melon flavor, but it seemed quickly muted by this odd sweet taste that made me feel ill. It wasn't highly unpleasant, but made it taste what I thought was overly candy like and so turned what could have tasted like something pleasant, into a cheap candy taste, that was too strong and so made me feel sick. Also the powdery consistency in the middle I don't think was strong enough, I noticed more of the soft outer covering than the filling, which was more interesting and so wanted to taste that more, but it was so easy to chew that it passed into me fast and was gone in a moment.",0
"I bought a bunch of this food to try out for my dog. The first day i noticed he has the worst gas i had ever smelled from him. And my dog isn't normally gassy. I alternated this food with the Rachel Ray food as well as normal dry dog food. Every day i fed him the chef michaels brand (i bought a few different flavors, and they all had a similar result) he gets gas, but is fine when fed other food. It was so bad i ended up giving away the remaining food i had bought.",0
"I read many of the reviews on this product before deciding to give it a try myself. I enjoy both lemon and ginger, so I thought there would be a fair chance that I would like this beverage.  I decided to have it one afternoon instead of a cup of coffee and here are my thoughts. It smelled very good after the hot water was added, I used 8-9 ounces.  On my first sip I was overwhelmed by the ginger. Obviously I expected ginger and lemon, but I was hoping that they would be in equal parts so that one didn't overpower the other; this was not the case. I continued to drink it, but after about a 1/4 of the cup I couldn't go on. I thought maybe if I diluted it a bit more that it would be okay, but while this lessened the ginger it made the lemon barely noticeable. Overall this drink isn't bad, it's just not for me.",0
"I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.",0
"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.",0
I didn't realize this was so big until I got it.  I ended giving it to my Fiance's mom for her GSD.,0
Don't drink coffe myself bought for my wife she liked it but not as much as french roast in white can by same company she loved that one by far,0
"On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.",0
It came on time and was in good shape and no slat was linking out of the box so I would buy more soon.,0

"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.",0
"Following Tazo's lead, Higgins & Burke has decided to market as ""green tea"" a tea where the dominant flavors are lemon and lemongrass. It's not bad, but it's green tea for people who don't like green tea.<br /><br />Bag for bag, this tea costs nearly twice as much as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BNE"">Bigelow's Green Tea</a>, which in my mind sets the bar for bagged green tea: a high-quality product that's almost ridiculously cheap. (Bigelow also offers a ""Green Tea with Lemon"" variety, which I haven't tried.) In short, I can't recommend Higgins & Burke's unexceptional offering.",0
"The K Cup system is great for quick coffee with no mess, but the taste is ok at best.",0

"A perfect half-time refreshment. The product is amazing, but there are several house hold remedies to treat dehydration (i'll spare you the nutrition lesson, do your research). The difference is these electrolyte packets provide the sodium & potassium you need to revitalize your energy much faster with less 'filler' ingredients, such as what you may get from mustard or alka-selzer. Bananas & sweet potatoes are great sources for potassium, but they're heavy on your belly (especially if you're a soccer player, like myself, or an endurance athlete).**Avoid choosing special delivery options, just go standard. i paid an extra $11 for a 2 day delivery. It took 5+ days--rip-off.**",0
"It has a nice smell when you open the package, but not all that much like coffee. More like Vanilla extract,it really is very lightly flavored compared to regular Starbucks, it could be called Starbucks lite. It has a very pleasent taste but weak. I think if you use a bit more than the usual amount it has a more powerful kick but still not Starbucks par. You can taste a slight Vanilla flavor still not nearly as strong as other flavored coffee I have tried, still very pleasent and tasty though. Not sure I would buy this varity for myself. I like mine a little stronger. If you like a weaker flavored coffee, then you will like this.",0
"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.

"This is one of the best terrarium plants I have used.<br />They are the right size for my 12'' net cubes for large adult mantids.<br /><br />The mantids love to climb on these, and they provide good protection for them.<br /><br />They are metal wire reinforced for bending into any possition, and the base has<br />a nice weight to it so the plant wont fall over.<br /><br />I have several of these, the bad news is that the branches tend to pull out of<br />the base they are glued to.<br />I have had to hot glue many of them back on.<br /><br />Another plus is that they are not slippery plastic. They are made of a compossit<br />of materials so your pets will not slip on the leaves and have a good footing.<br /><br />Price is fair as well.<br /><br />I would recommend these for your terrarium, just have a tube of glue handy!!",0
"It's hard to find the large size of Tassimo T-pods online.  These are offered by Maxwell House and Gevalia.  Both are of equal quality to my taste so go with the less expensive Maxwell House.  One warning, occasionally this brews a very weak cup.  If you want a consistently great cup of coffee, go with Starbucks!  Their house blend is a good cup of medium richness and if you have the patience to brew the the extra 3 ounces manually by holding the + button you'll still end up with a better cup of coffee.",0
"This Bar B Q seasoning is okay, not bad but not what I had before. It does add flavor to your meals, but it is not the same Bar B Q seasoning I purchased before from a different retailer. The other shaker was more of an orange color than red, maybe that was the difference, plus it had a little more flavor.",0
"After trying out one other brand of Kuerig pumpkin spice coffee, I found this brand to be decent but not fantastic. Maybe it's personal taste but the actual pumpkin taste was a little too weak for me but otherwise, the coffee was very good.",0
"I eat Kraft Mac & Cheese dinners a few times a month, sometimes the deluxe and sometimes the regular type.  I never serve them as the main entree but as a side dish & I stick to the recommended serving size.  I thought that I would really like the Cheesy Skillets as a change-up from the usual but I found the onion flavor/aroma overpowering.  Now, I'm not a big fan of onions so someone who likes Kraft's other Mac & Cheese offerings and loves onions might love this one.  It is what it is:  a quick-fix dish for those who aren't watching fat, sodium, and/or cholesterol in their diets.",0
"We had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting, rich flavor to us.  For some reason, this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison.  The search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues...",0
I love the taste and consistency of this bar. And the added calcium is a plus. But I try not to eat it too often because it has 12 grams of fat and the saturated fat is 25% of daily value. And 2g of protein is a bummer.,0
"We love the Stella D'Oro Anisette Toast cookies.  For some reason, they are no longer stocked in our local stores.  So, we have resorted to ordering them on line.  This last shipment, in boxes,  expiring Dec. 2009,  are stale and hard.  Every box. One of the boxes had a hole in the plastic inner wrap.  I really miss our Anisette toast.  How can we get them fresher.<br /><br />Very disappointed,  Jacqueline W.",0
"It doesn't really taste like tea at all. I like the slight bitterness in tea. But this mostly just tastes sweet. It did dissolve quite well though, even just stirred into a glass of cool water. No shaking necessary.",0
"My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts.",0
"I'm used to the older, slightly crunchy Chips Ahoy. I never really like the chewy ones, and these are one step even more extreme than that, having fudge paste in the middle. I think it's too much chocolate in one package, but that's just me. The picture on the package makes it seem like the center is gooey, but even the heat of a Chicago summer, it's still quite thick. I'm glad I tried them, but I wouldn't buy them again.",0
"Decent corn. Del monte is better, and I prefer white corn, but this was ok. Quite wattery, so make sure you drain!",0
"I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!",0
"These have a nice tart natural-tasting berry flavor and smooth texture.  Unfortunately they also have a strong, lingering vitamin aftertaste.  Also, the serving size for children over 4 is 4 vitamins, which makes them more than twice as expensive as other brands of gummy vitamins.",0
"I bought this after reading the raving reviews.  It is undoubtedly, healthy for you.  It also takes a lot of time to cook and you need to bring your creative side into the kitchen to make it palatable.  Since I now have several cans of this stuff (the cans are smaller than the photo appears, by the way, so check the size) to consume, I've purchased some sugar free jam to mix with it to give it (hopefully) a hint of flavor.  Quite frankly I just don't see the ""wow factor"" with this oatmeal.  I'm going to finish it since I bought it (although the idea did cross my mind to pawn it off on relatives as an unusual gift idea), but afterwards it is back to Quaker Oats for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/04/08:  I find it really interesting that when your opinion differs from the more popular ones, your review is considered ""unhelpful"" ;)",0
"I would prefer that they be tart, but they are quite sweet with some tartness.  It's a matter of taste, of course.",0
"Beneful is an inexpensive dog food from Purina, one of the original and best- known names in pet food. This particular Purina product is a little different from most in that it contains different colors and shapes of kibbles along with vegetables for a supposedly better- balanced diet.<br /><br />Beneful is an easy to find dog food sold in most stores, including both pet foods and grocery stores/supermarkets. Its widely available status and low price make it an easily recognizable and popular  product and its re-sealable bag is very convenient. It keeps the food inside and undesirable things out, so that the dog food remains fresh and edible for a long time.<br /><br />Name recognition, popularity, low price, nice packaging- these are all good extras, but what about the dog food itself? Well, it seems to be hit and miss with this product. The level of protein isn't too bad and the level of fat is kept under control, but the ingredient list is cause for concern. The first four ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and whole wheat flour. These are not the ingredients you want to see at the top of a list for your dog's primary source of nutrition. Dogs need meat- not meat by products but real, quality meat- and the best quality dog foods have meat listed first.<br /><br />Some of the other ingredients are equally questionable. The dried peas and carrots are fine, but look at all of those artificial colors. Yes, it does make the food look pretty when poured into a bowl, but this is more for human appeal- a dog really doesn't care about seeing varied hues in its food. A dog just wants something that tastes good while you, the owner, want something with quality and good nutrition.<br /><br />Speaking of the taste, Beneful does score points in this area and that might be a good part of the reason why so many dog owners buy this for their canine friends. Dogs really love this food, and my dog is no exception. He will finish off a large bowl without even pausing and he seems anxious for more.<br /><br />So, how do I rate Beneful dog food overall? Well, I find it has both good points and bad points. It worst quality is the ingredients, but then again, when I look at the ingredients of other dog foods in the same price range, what I see on the Beneful label isn't all that bad. Dogs love the taste, and the nutritional aspects are okay. Thus, when all factors are considered, Beneful rates average overall. It can't compare to the high- quality dog food brands sold in many pet stores, but it has enough good points to recommend it-- barely.",0
"This so called ""No Calorie Sweetener"" does indeed have calories!  According to the Splenda website, one cup of Splenda has 96 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />If you want a sweetener for baking, use a liquid Sucralose sweetener.",0
"These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.",0
"I don't want to give this low stars because of my own misinformation but also can't give it ""5' because clearly it was of no benefit to me...I was unaware this product might be more suited to African American hair as the shampoo commercials for the same maker predominantly feature white people.  In any event, the product is akin to putting Vaseline on my scalp and I haven't used it very often.  I can use it in the shower as an additional conditioner and wash it out, however.  I noted the review on here from an AA person and they were happy with the product so really, I would direct you to their review for a more informative look into said product.  On a positive note, it does smell very nice and their shampoo and conditioner are quite awesome.",0
"I smelled the vanilla when I initially opened the bag but upon brewing it I really couldn't say I detected any vanilla flavoring.  We've made the entire bag and I had no impression that I was drinking anything other than just black coffee, no vanilla undertones.  I asked my husband what he thought about the vanilla coffee and he said, ""what vanilla coffee?""  He couldn't even tell.  Nevertheless, it's starbucks and still a good cup of joe.",0
"Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually ""sticks"" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.",0
not bad... but there are better ones (like kona!).  would pass on this on just because there are better tasting ones in this price range.,0
"I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery - but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented. I didn't bother with asking for replacement - we had an immediate use for the product (made lots of pumpkin pie), so this is a word of caution to other buyers. We will do this again - but next time, we will not be so forgiving.",0
"While I like the meals in general, this one had a nasty surprise. The package of edamame is PRODUCT OF CHINA.<br /><br />Knowing China's food safety standards or total lack thereof, who would want to put that in their mouth? Bad show. Pick another supplier, GoPicnic!",0
"This rice will set you *way* back for a 2 lb bag, but if you want the heritage strain of rice that along with indigo was the foundation of the Colonial Carolina economy, this is the right stuff.  I cannot speak to its qualities as a side dish, but it is exactly suited for risottos and stews - thick and filling.  As a Revolutionary War reenactor, I splurged on a bag and brought it to an immersion weekend in winter at Jockey Hollow in Morristown, NJ.  1 pound of this rice cooked with venison and carrots on a hearth in a 14 x 16 log hut fed nearly a dozen hungry Continentals. For living historians who want an authentic, period experience, this product will satisfy even the stitch counters in your hobby.  Gourmets and Gourmands in modern times may have other thoughts.",0
"The honey is great, however, the packaging was a sticky mess.  As far as I can tell, the hot weather caused the honey to expand and it leaked thru the packaging.  It was the inside packaging, not the bubble wrap and box the product was shipped in.  The honey company did not stand my their packaging when contacted.  They stated it was Amazon's problem.  Not so.  Never was resolved.  Therefore, I'm only giving it 3 stars.",0
The nicest thing about this coffee is how it makes the kitchen smell. The taste is not as chocolaty as the smell suggests; really nothing too special.,0
It is a good munchy. Gives you the satisfaction of a crunch. Fresh apples are much better.,0
"This bar is super yummy, but I have to agree that falsely advertising it as an almond walnut macadamia bar, when most of the bar is peanuts, is a big turn off!",0
"I bought this item because I wanted to try agave syrup as a sweetener.  I have not opened it, because the bottle and its packaging are too beautiful to open.  I have it sitting on my desk, wondering when I will get to try the agave syrup.",0
"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",0
"Very misleading to call this pineapple ""jelly"".  This is more like pineapple syrup with chunks.  It is probably impossible to get pineapple to jel, due to the enzymes in it.  Mr. BarryFarm ought to give it up.  Very disappointed.",0
"Alright, maybe it is just me, but I don't care for the flavor by itself too much.<br /><br />I originally tried some with burritos by pouring some in the beans and mixing it, and then by pouring some extra right inside the burrito after getting it together. How was it? The heat was excellent. It wasn't something I couldn't handle, it was rather enjoyable. Don't misunderstand me, it was most certainly hot, but it wasn't unbearably so (not to me anyway, and nobody else in my family has tried it thus far).<br /><br />After the burritos, and having put everything away, I decided to try about a teaspoon of the sauce by itself.<br /><br />Alright, this time it felt hotter (particularly as some of it got on the back of my throat)... it was enough to cause me to hiccup... but, and this is the reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5, the flavor just wasn't there... I really didn't like it by itself.<br /><br />So my suggestion to anyone buying this sauce: use it in a way that doesn't involve you tasting it by itself... mixed with beans in a burrito, toss some in a pan with some roasted garlic and spices to change up the taste, do whatever, but I can't recommend it in a way that gives you the direct flavor of the sauce. Some sauces are great by themselves, without other things to cover their tastes, but this isn't one of them... although it is great for giving a burger or burrito a nice kick",0
"I was disappointed in this mix. It is quite bland and boring. I made this with coconut milk (which is sweet) and was surprised to find it had little flavor. I added a large amount of brown sugar and salt. I would rate it mild, so there was not much spice or aromatics. Needs lots of red chilis, which should be included in the mix. The Red Curry mix is much better - that one has a nice bite. And the Peanut Sauce mix is amazing. Too bad I now have a dozen of these yellow curry packs. Thai yellow curry is my favorite at restaurants.",0
"This item tastes just like carbonated cherry juicy juice... or rather what cherry juicy juice would taste like if it was carbonated.  It tastes fine, but the bottom line is that I would rather just drink juicy juice and go without the carbonation.  That's basically why I rated this item at 3 stars.  It's fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one.<br /><br />As an alternative to cola, this is probably the healthier choice.  You get far more vitamins and natural sugars than a can of coke or pepsi would provide.  However, the calorie content is still pretty high.  A 12oz can of coke is what? 200 calories?  This 8.3 oz can of cherry soda-juice is 170 calories.  Granted, they're not such empty calories if you're actually getting nutrition, but drinking these will certainly not make one thin.<br /><br />I take it that based on the name of this product, Switch, that they're marketing it as a safer alternative to cola.  And it is absolutely that.  Just don't go thinking that if you switch to juice that you'll start losing weight.  That is certainly not the case.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not sure this product is really needed in America's already bloated soft drink market.  But good luck to them anyway.",0
"Ok here is the short version, I love a strong cup of coffee but I dont like french roast. So this coffee is strong and has almost no bitter after tase but it does have a french roast taste to it, so if that is what you like try this.

"This sauce tastes like brown bread mixed with barbecue sauce and vinegar. Sorry if that doesn't sound appetizing, but thats what it is. It's hot (oh man, is it hot) but I just cant find a good food to pair it with.<br /><br />The sauce is so thick that it's nearly impossible to get it out of the bottle, and by the time you get it out, it comes out so fast that you're praying for the future of your [...].<br /><br />I have it, and I like it because its hot, but I don't use it. It's been used maybe once or twice in the past few months. I have hotter sauces that I use more frequently because they taste better.<br /><br />Buy it though, its the original!",0
"I was moved to try this coffee because of other reviews I had read while coffee shopping. I wanted to try something different, as I regularly switch brands. Bottom line, it's just OK. I not bad but it's not great either. I was expecting something called Kicking Horse coffee to be a pretty bold cup o'mud, but alas, it was just kinda... well... ok. It comes in nice tins though.",0
"I was looking for 100% Pure Papaya juice which is recommended for people with medical conditions that create too much phlegm. It is one of the few substances that cuts the phlegm. I didn't read the label closely enough and got suckered into buying this. Apple juice doesn't ""cut it"".<br /><br />It would seem from my preliminary research that the only places that carry 100% pure Papaya juice are Health Food stores. I bought this at Whole Foods but I didn't check the Health Foods aisle.",0
"Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me. It has a good smell of coconut skin & not too sweet. However, I prefer the Kind Bar Almond & Apricot without yogurt (love it!) since the bar is softer/chewier.  If you like a bit sweeter taste, choose the one with yogurt.",0
I really like the way this seasoning tastes but it wasn't very long until the seasoning began to combine together so it wasn't like fine salt but more like big clumps of seasoning so it doesn't sprinkle well.,0

"I have followed the instructions religiously, but am having problems with this kit.  One of the plants is about a third of the size as the others.  It hasn't grown at all in weeks.  I am at 10 weeks with my garden and two plants have a ton of tomatos.  Customer service suggested trimming back my good plants so the smaller would be closer to the light.  I can't see cutting off all my flowers and tomatos to take a chance on a plant that seems defective.<br /><br />Added May 6th, 2007: I woke up this week to discover the two plants that actually grew were tipped over and falling out of the garden.  They were fine the night before.  They have been cared for exactly as the book suggests.  I tried ""staking"" them, but the only option is to tie them to the grow light arm, and doing so just does not keep the plants upright.  The just tip the side instead.  On a positive note, I finally harvested my first tomato (yellow variety) after about 95 days.  It tasted okay.  I am hoping the reds taste more like a real garden tomato.<br /><br />Added May 14th, 2007: So far, all of the tomatos that have been harvested are quite sour.  I had such high hopes, but now I am sorry to say I can not recommend this kit to anyone.",0
"To begin, let me say that Bob's Red Mill makes quality products and this soup mix is no exception.  The ingredients are all natural and organic and this is unquestionably healthy food.  I've ordered a number of Bob's products and I think Bob's Red Mill is the kind of company that we should feel good about supporting.<br /><br />However, not only is this not vegetable soup, but in my view, it really isn't even soup.  It is a combination of lentils, split peas, barley and pasta alphabet letters made from some form of ground tomato & spinach powder or the like.  But these alphabet letters don't taste like vegetables.<br /><br />So, this is basically a mostly legume-based soup starter rather than a vegetable soup mix.  If you cook this ""soup"" as directed, it will have essentially no flavor other than the very bland taste of the legumes that are present.<br /><br />There is no seasoning whatsoever, no visible vegetables, and it does not taste like vegetable soup.<br /><br />Now others have noted that you can add your own spices, seasonings, vegetables and meat and that's true.  And once you do this, you might indeed have a very good soup, depending of course upon your cooking skills, or lack thereof.<br /><br />But if you're not a good cook, and/or are unwilling to add your own seasonings and ingredients, then you will likely not have a good soup.  Conversely, with most other brands I've tried, if you purchase soup mix and cook it, then you will indeed have soup.  With this ""soup"" mix, if you purchase it and cook it, you won't have what I consider to be soup.<br /><br />If you are planning on serving this ""soup"" to guests and you simply throw it in a pot and cook as per the directions, the end result will likely not be very good.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a good soup base.  But I don't think it should be called soup and calling it vegetable soup is even more of a stretch, because there are no visible vegetables or vegetable flavor.<br /><br />5 stars for the ingredients which are organic, fresh and very healthy.  But 1 star because most people would be unhappy with this ""soup"", if cooked as directed.  So we'll average the 2 and give it a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I can't tell you it's not worth buying, but if you purchase this, it's important to understand exactly what you are getting.",0

"I was rather disappointed with this product. First, it arrived totally melted and liquified. To the company's everlasting credit, they gave me a full refund. The level of customer service was excellent. But I found this product to be greasy and unwieldy. I used it as a body lotion, but felt slimy. I also tried to massage it on my cat (who usually enjoys a 'kitty spa experience') and he ran from me. This is not a product I would order again, although I believe this is an awesome company.",0
I thought this would be a refreshing drink with blueberry flavor and no sugar. It is sparkling but that's about it. The flavor is just a suggestion - maybe of green leaves but not much of anything else. I was disappointed in this product and I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Update: 4/14/2011 - I served the chilled blueberry drink to my daughter-in-law when she wanted something bubbly. She really liked the light flavor and the fact there is no sweetening (no sugar or artificial stuff) in the drink. I made her a gift of 3/4s of a case and she went home happy. I'm upping my rating.,0
"I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the ""Ecopad""  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details) which I use in my Senseo, and I was fairly disappointed.  It was easy to see that the Marley Coffee Pods made much weaker coffee (lighter color, almost watery appearance).  I think I will stick with my Ecopad coffee pods.<br /><br />Incidentally, I want to put in a good word here for the Senseo coffee maker.  It is great for making a single cup of coffee (or maybe even a few cups of coffee but not at the same time).  The Ecopad pods are just as economical as regular coffee (you just spoon ground coffee into the Ecopad and make coffee as usual).",0
"I inadvertently purchased this product instead of Spry brand (my sister - unfamiliar with unhealthy additives - had purchased XyloBurst and the name must've stuck in my brain when I went to reorder my usual Spry and I got the two confused).<br /><br />It's very irritating when these items sold on Amazon do NOT contain the product label listing the ingredients.  This forces quality/health-concious individuals to waste valuable time locating this information on the web.  (I've learned that if it's not listed in their ad to just keep on moving because every product I've ever had to FIND the information myself ended up being something I would NOT buy.  Quality manufacturers proudly 'boast' their ingredients.  Some do that as well as proudly list the 'unsavory' ingredients NOT in their product.)<br /><br />Other than having ARTIFICIAL flavors and TITANIUM DIOXIDE, it DOES have Xylitol and a robust cinnamon ""flavor"" but I'll be sticking with the Spry brand.",0
"I ordered them after reading an article about the benefits of tart cherries. These cherries are wonderful by themselves, in cookies, or with a nut mixture.

"I'm not a huge fan of hard candy, but when I saw how cute the packaging was for these candies, I couldn't resist. The wrappers come in pearly pastel colors with different flowers on them. Even though the wrappers are different, the flavor is the same for each candy. It's somewhere in the realm between plum and peach, and isn't very strong. I didn't really want anymore after I had the first one.",0
I bought this mustard seed to add to my home made summer sausage thinking that it would add some flavor to it but it didn't. this mustard seed has no flavor at all not sure if I need to do something to it before I add it to the sausage or not.

"The product itself is good I suppose.  Maybe it's just my dog.  I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day.",0
"This is basically sweeten corn flakes with peanuts added. They're okay and I'll probably eat them, but there's really nothing special about them.  A repackaging of flavors Kellogg's already has.  Very sweet, so if you like that sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy it.",0
"I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was ""okay"".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.

Cost wise, also about the same, as the Soda-Club mix comes in a smaller container that you use less of, but with this Syrup you get a lot more, but have to use a little more for the same results.<br />So in the end, if I am already ordering something else from the Soda Club, then I would just use the Cola syrup they sell, otherwise, I would order this syrup.",0
"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first.",0
"We have a small dog (17 lbs) and she could not get started on these - they were too hard to bite.  Once we cut them in half (which is quite hard to do!) she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them.  We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half.",0
"Let me begin by explaining where my palate is coming from. My usual coffee is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y2QTTI"">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, French Roast, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. I'd actually prefer to drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5O4G"">Starbucks French Roast Coffee (Extra Bold), Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, but I just can't afford it. So, I like French roast, which has a darker, bolder flavor, and I thought I'd give this coffee a try.<br /><br />I would rate the flavor of this coffee as middling. It didn't have that paint-thinner flavor that cheap coffees have (I'm looking at you Folgers). But it also didn't have the depth and richness that I associate with high-quality French roasts. Not a lot of body in this coffee (body is that heaviness on the tongue). Most French roasts have much more body, but some people might prefer this coffee because it has less. Taste-wise, this coffee is also fairly low in acidity (which you would expect from the brand), but low acidity is characteristic of most French roasts. I don't know how much easier this will be on the sensitive stomach.<br /><br />My guess is that if your stomach has serious acid problems, then this coffee will still be too much for it. If you just get a little sour stomach, you might be able to handle some other brands, and trial and error should lead you to the right one. I hesitate to recommend this coffee because of the price. You're paying a premium price for a middling flavor. I think most people  with acid sensitivity should be able to find a better coffee they can stomach for the same price or a much cheaper option with the same flavor. But, if you try this coffee and it works for you, enjoy. It's not a bad coffee; I just didn't find its flavor outstanding.",0
"While it didn't taste like hazelnut at all to me, I like this product. I just mixed it in with the regular unflavored. I find that I use a little over half the recommended amount per cup, and it suits me fine.",0
"I love my flavored k-cups, but this one I am somewhat disappointed with. It does not have the hazelnut flavor I expected. Gloria Jean's other flavors I do enjoy very much, like the Butter Toffee. I just ordered the variety pack to try some of the other flavors. This one just was not one of my favorites.",0
"I was prepared to not really like this. Green tea usually does not take to being flavored very well. This one surprised me in not only being drinkable but tasty.  The lemongrass and lemon balm are things I already flavor some teas with and verbena is often even infused by itself.<br /><br />It says Premium Sencha Green Tea.  This was not the case in my box. It was average at best. Like any green tea it likes water that has cooled a bit after boiling (195F max). It gets the stereotypical bitter and 'burnt' flavors you get from using hotter water. It was not bad tea, just not even a mid end loose leaf Sencha you could get from a number of places.  The extra flavors cover this surprisingly well though.<br /><br />Two teabags had the slightly soapy taste you get when verbena is improperly handled. I sent a note to the company that it was noticed and they gave a very friendly ad rapid reply. I can only hope they learn from the errors as they go along.  Which lead me to look at their other teas and offerings. It looks like a decent company that is expanding.  I hope with some experience they become one of the more ethical tea importers the profess to wanting to be.<br /><br />Right now this isn't one I'd have as a staple in my pantry.<br />If I saw it in a restaurant I would pick it over Tzao or Numi for sure.<br /><br />Good if you want some green tea with a little different taste.<br />If you're used to loose leaf higher end teas, you'll be disappointed.",0
"I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!",0
"Plus:<br />- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.<br />- Subscribe and Save saves money.<br />- Son ate it.<br />- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.<br />- Like the 8 ounce size containers.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.<br />- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.<br />- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.<br /><br />I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did.",0
"I got this coconut oil for my baby's diaper rash because we use cloth diapers. I don't think it has been terribly effective for its intended purpose, as it doesn't really clear up the rash quickly. Also, it's very liquidy in even slightly warmer temperatures and tends to make a mess everywhere as it spreads upon contact with body heat.<br /><br />However, it smells very good, and I've used it in the kitchen for cooking as well.",0
I had always heard about 'buckeyes' so decided to order some to distribute at Christmas.  The peanut butter is a bit much for me but my son and great grandson loved them and he WOULD eat them until he was sick if allowed.,0
"This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow ""cups"" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else.",0
"Sorry I can't give this stuff a screaming good review.  Maybe catnip is a sort of personal thing as our cat Tasha has shown great interest in catnip filled mice in the past but this catnip she's ambivalent to.  Hence why I can only give the product a neutral three stars.  I stuffed a catnip mouse with this product and she checked the freshly filled mouse out but showed a nearby older catnip laced mouse more interest.  I placed a small amount next to her on the back patio and yes, after two sessions, she ate it all but other than laying there, she seemed not to be affected by the catnip.  I fed some catnip to her a second time and she ate a bit but in the end, blew the rest of the catnip off.  In the morning while my wife and I are on the patio for coffee, Tasha's more animated in her morning play without then with.<br /><br />In summary, I can't say it's not good catnip, I can only say that Tasha didn't show a whole lot of interest in this product.  I guess like beer, everybody has their product preferences and for her, this doesn't seem to be knocking her socks off.  I'm currently looking at other catnip products, including sprays and extract oils.  FWIW, if we wanted, we can get this same product at our local pet store for a bit less then here; including California sales tax, $5.50.  When one takes into consideration the price of gas coupled to the time it takes to shop for a product of this kind, this is a reasonably priced product.  I'll keep trying to interest Tasha in this product as I'm not going throw the catnip away.  And if she shows more than a passing interest, I'll stop by, change my star rating and amend what I've written here.  Until then, hope my above helps with your shopping decision.",0

"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",0
"I so wanted to like this, but neither I nor my kids will eat it. It seems far superior to Nutella in nutrition and quality, but if you're used to the sweet creamy spreadability of Nutella, this may not work for you. Definitely start with one jar (not the SuperSaver 3 pack).",0
"I am beginning to think all Honey & Nut cereals are the same. I did not find Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal to be any different in taste from the other leading brands. It has the same sweetness, crunchiness and texture as the others. I would suggest reading the nutrition facts to compare this cereal to your usual brand of honey & nut cereal to see if one is nutritionally better. According to the box, a serving is 3/4 of a cup of Crunchy Nut cereal and contains 140 calories with 1/2 cup of fat-free milk. Each serving holds 1g of fat, 125mg of sodium, 23g of carbs (10g from sugars), and 2g of protein.<br /><br />On a side note, I am finding Amazon to be in line with grocery store prices, especially if you sign up for automatic deliveries and purchase in bulk. I have been pleasantly surprised with the grocery orders I have placed. Everything has arrived fresh and safely packaged.",0
Thought I would be getting an herbal tea with a little more kick than the regular caffine kick of a cup of coffee...NOT. Just tastes like green tea...nothing more...,0
"At almost a dollar for one TINY can (the same exact size as a fancy feast) I would personally never buy this product; it just isn't worth it. I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food.",0
"These are wonderful crackers buy why are they so expensive.  Costco had a box of three packages for $9-$11 dollars.  The prices on Amazon, OUCH!",0
"------------ Product Review 5 Stars -------------<br />The powder is good and cheap (compared to other brands), and tastes great in my smoothie.  A 5-star product for sure!  It needs to be refrigerated after opening and is good for 60 days.  The scoop is over twice as big as the scoop that came in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q1SYNQ"">Perfect foods Acai Powder</a>, so although the Sambazon Acai Powder costs less (and is just as good), the price probably comes out to be close to the same if you use the huge Sambazon scoop.<br /><br />If celebrity endorsements matter to you, Alton Brown recommends using the Sambazon brand acai juice. Since he's a food scientist, you can be sure he's researched his product.  Although he's not using the powder, the fact that he specifically uses Sambazon, gives me some greater comfort in using it because apparently, not all acai products are equal.<br /><br />------------ Seller Review 1 Star --------------<br />I hate it when people review the seller and not the product in this area, but this seller violated one of the MAJOR reasons I use Amazon. Also, there was not enough room in the seller review area for me to warn other folks, and trust me, you need to be warned.  So here it is...<br /><br />I enjoy using Amazon because I don't get put on junk email lists by sellers.  After buying this product, I received a non-Amazon email from the seller requesting my feedback.  I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and this is the first time I've experienced this kind of solicitation.  I'm now finding myself having to go to a non-Amazon website, [...] requesting to be removed from their marketing.  Are you serious?  Subscriptionloop.com?  That should send chills up your spine!  God only knows who has my email address now.  If you hate spam, the potential for spam, or don't want a company called subscriptionloop.com to have your email address, avoid this seller at all costs.  As most of us know, it only takes one mistake with your email address and then it's spam city.  I fear that I have made that mistake by using this seller.<br /><br />**Note: When I purchased this product in Feb 2012, it was being sold by Beepco llc (Sun Light Savings).  It now shows that it's being sold by Amazon, and if that's the case, then you shouldn't have my experience.  If it changes to Sun Light Savings though, you've been warned...**",0
"My Yorkie liked this food, but it was too expensive. I paid the same price for a small 1 lb bag that I normally pay for a large bag of high quality dog food. But sellers shipped quickly.",0
"My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.  Of course, if air gets into the cans, the food will not be safe to eat.  Makes me wonder if they are selling ""seconds.""  Would account for the great price.  Would have liked to have heard back from them.",0
"The low sodium & reduced fat crackers by Dare are the best tasting that I have tried.  They are great with savory or sweet and delicious with assorted cheese.  I will keep them stocked in my pantry.  Unfortunately, they arrived with many broken pieces which I was able to use as topping for salads.  I really think Dare Breton is a reliable brand you can depend on.  IMHO I think Amazon fell down on the job of preparing them for shipping.",0
"High Fiber with low sugar content, overall a healthy snack.  The taste, however, is not that great ... and I don't consider myself a picky eater.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying different brands and flavors of coffee but this assortment was 90% Green Mountain and 75% some type of vanilla.  It included 4 Blueberry (haven't tried that yet but not really happy about it).  I get the impression that you get about 4 or 5 of a good variety and then a handful each of whatever flavors don't sell very well.  Luckily I'm okay with all the vanilla but this definitely was not a ""variety"" pack.",0
"Each packet of this Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple is actually good for two servings, according to the printed instructions on the packet.  This was just fine with me since I don't like my drink to be too sweet.  So I tend to just pour a half-packet's worth of contents into a glass filled with very cold water each time I want to use this product, then give the mix a good stir.<br /><br />The drink tastes sweet.  I can discern the tea but not the mango or pineapple.  There is a hint of honey, but the drink's sweetness is probably due to the sucralose, which is listed as the fourth ingredient.  I didn't discern an aftertaste.  Overall, I think it's a fine drink.  Nothing really special to get excited about.",0
I liked them.  She didn't.  Since I was trying to please her I guess I can't give the chocolates more than 3 starts.  She and I both like Ghirardelli chocolate but this particular product didn't get me past first base.,0
"I want to love this food, but my two cats turn their nose up at it.  My bag did seem a fair bit drier than some of the other grain-free kibble I've tried with them, so it may have been a purely textural thing for them.  I'm not a cat so I don't know why exactly they snubbed this food.  They did eventually eat the entire bag, with nice healthy coats and all the other wonderful attributes that come with feeding grain free, but they looked at me like I was crazy and meowed incessantly before finally eating each time.<br /><br />Give it a shot!  Maybe your cat(s) will love this, mine did not.  So based on this experience I'm leaving 3 stars and my search continues.",0
"I bought these in hopes that they would be a substitute for any crunchy baked fluorescent orange ""cheese"" cracker.  Instead, I got its more mature and sexier cousin.  These actually taste like cheese, not just any cheese but like good sharp and pungent cheese.  This could be off putting to those wanting that nostalgic synthetic cheddar flavor.  That being said I didn't like these at first, but once I realized that they are not in the same category as Goldfish, I snacked on with content.<br /><br />The texture of these are like those of any of Shar's cracker products.  It has a similar grittiness(?) of other gluten free foods.  On the gluten-free gritty scale of 1-10, 10 representing the ultimate grittiness, this stuff gets a 4.  It's texture is obviously gluten-free, but it's not offensive.<br /><br />Overall, I found this okay.  It's not a staple of my cabinet, but it's not condemned from it either.",0
"My cats all eat this, but I find it messy to serve, especially the chicken pot pie cans which seem to be 50 percent liquid. When you pull off the pop top, you can't help but get splashed by it. And it seems like you're not getting that much food for your money since it's so much liquid. The Chinese chicken is not as liquidy.<br /><br />I have no idea how to compare this to other brands price-wise because it is not sold in my state. I've never seen it in stores.",0
"Timothy's Italian Blend is a standard Medium roast coffee - nothing remarkable in my opinion.  I found it to have a hint of bitterness, which is also a negative for me.<br /><br />I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512"">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> because Tully's seems to have a little more flavor, but is also a touch bolder.<br /><br />If you are a medium to light blend coffee drinker, then you may find this blend pleasing; however, if you lean to medium bold blends, then you should look elsewhere.",0
"Convenient and better tasting than typical instant coffee but if you like a medium to strong cup, you will probably be disappointed. Using less water obviously helps a bit. If you plan on having more than one cup, it might be worth your time to brew a small pot, even if some ends up going down the drain.<br />I found the Folgers brand to be marginally better in terms of taste but still weaker than I normally would prefer.<br />Given the convenience factor however, I will likely buy this or the Folgers' product again.",0
"These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality!",0

"When I started buying this for my kittens it was $23/bag.  When I returned a couple of months ago to purchase again and saw the HUGE price spike I took my biz elsewhere.  The food itself, at least from the west coast plant which is where mine came from, is excellent quality and I fed this to my kittens and fed the dog food to my dogs.  However I won't be buying it anymore since the price hike and I actually ended up switching to a local brand where I know exactly what is going into my ""kids'"" food and I'm getting the same amount for $1.50 more.  Better deal all the way around.<br /><br />I suggest looking elsewhere for a different food.  Chicken Soup is becoming more and more scarce.",0
"The box reads that Ahmad English Breakfast tea is ""a blend of Ceylon and other origin teas packed in Sri Lanka"".<br /><br />I've tried Twinings' and Dilmah's English breakfast teas. I would rank Twinings first, followed by Dilmah and then Ahmad.<br /><br />Twinings has the best flavor and comes closest to the classic taste.<br /><br />Dilmah is decent, but doesn't taste as full bodied as Twinings.<br /><br />I didn't like Ahmad. It tasted more like Dilmah's Ceylon tea than English Breakfast Tea.",0
"Don't get me wrong, the product was great! We used them at our wedding for coffee and tea time... half the people didn't even notice them which was fine with  me. When the package arrived at my door I thought.... WOW that's quite a large wedding present. Then I opened it to find it was actually two very small boxes in one very large box full of foam popcorn. It was then I realized why shipping was almost $30. Such a rip off. I'm very dissapointed. I used to work for an online retailer and that is the exact opposite of their shipping policy. It would have actually cost less than $10 to ship this product to me. And for goodness sakes, it's sugar! I thought $6 for a little tube was a bit much, then factoring in the shipping. The hearts were not all perfect either....... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C9VKVM"">White Heart Shaped Sugar Cubes</a>",0

I also purchased the ""no salt"" version - not even close to ""Mrs. Dash"", nutmeg, turmeric (also settled and 20% less by volume, and others.

"There must be a common ingredient that all ""chewy"" cookie makers use because they all taste the same. Be it Soft Chews, Chips Ahoy Chewy, or even Pepperidge Farm, whatever it is that keeps these cookies chewy also keeps them palpably homogeneous.  Chips Ahoy Gooey are no different.  Even the ""fudge"" on the inside tastes like ""that flavor"". Now don't get me wrong, ""that flavor"" is good and put me in the right mood, it's positively addicting.  Just know that's exactly what you're getting into here and don't expect a chocolate chip symphony in your mouth.",0
"The insanity sauce is great, just as a food additive more then a sauce.  I add a drop or two to a bowl of chili to really spice it up.  The other two could be good hot sauces, but it had this weird bitter taste due to adding acetic acid.  You could really taste the garlic in the garlic sauce, but it was just over whelmed by the acetic acid.  Some like bitter, I don't.  Would buy the Insanity again, but not the other two.",0

"Having grown up on Nabisco Fig Newtons, I was eager to sample this latest Nabisco fig product. After trying these fig and honey thins, I wondered ""what was the point?"" Although tasty and good for dunking in coffee, they pale in comparison to fig newtons from the standpoint of taste, nutrition, and overall appeal. These thins are pleasantly sweetened with honey with specks of dried figs, but they can hardly be called ""Fruit Thins"" since the figs are so insignificant. I and members of my family enjoyed them with our coffee, but we all decided that we probably would never purchase another bag. We found this product too understated. We'll stick with our Fig Newtons, thank you very much.",0
"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",0
"NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",0
"Add this product to 8 oz water and you get a flavored drink. It dissolves well, and doesn't taste bad, but I can't say it tastes great either.<br /><br />I've used a number of these types of products mostly to give some flavor to water more than to get any health benefit.<br /><br />There are lots of similar products available. Try a few different products and stick with what YOU like. Each product has some combination of ""special"" ingredients that are used to differentiate them from each other. I didn't think this product was anything special.<br /><br />If you want less expensive water favor, try Crystal Light On The Go, I liked the Lightly Lemon version.<br /><br />Some of these products flavor 8 oz, and some 16 oz - so when evaluating cost/benefit make sure you know how much water it flavors. Eboost flavors only 8 oz, but costs the same as some of the 16 oz products.",0
"There were at least 10 dark roast cups in the box, which is about a third of the box.  There were also a few flavored cups.  This box was shipped to and arrived in Alaska without problem.

So, based on that I won't be buying my coffee from Amazon in the future.  How dumb is that?",0
Flavor was good but it was not the consistency I am used to in custard.  Much thinner when finished.  Tried adding more of the powder to next batch but that was gooey.  Will keep it for winter and thin is down with 1/2 and 1/2 amd use it for eggnog.,0

When I opened the package, the espresso didn't have the good oily bean quality I wanted it to. The beans seemed a little old. Also, the quality of the crema wasn't as good as Starbucks espresso or Peet's. Again, the taste was good and these were both minor details.",0

I was about to give away my Keurig brewer but Revv(tm) Coffee K-Cup saved the day.  What an excellent coffee that I just ordered another 4 boxes from a different web site.  I always like to compare price before buying. Be a smart shopper, look around and do your research.",0
"Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.",0
These crackers have a nice texture - crisp and just a little flaky. They are a bit on the salty side and are good paired with creamier cheeses that will cut a little of the salt.<br /><br />The butter taste is a more akin to a margarine flavor which is where this cracker looses points with me. Kind of like if you tried to make a croissant with oil - just not quite what's called for. These would be much better with an authentic butter taste.,0
"The texture of these cookies is odd, almost a plastic like feel.  They did eventually get eaten, which is why I gave it three stars, but in a house with three kids, it's not hard to imagine cookies of any quality being eaten.",0
"The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!",0
"I drink tea on a very regular basis.  Mostly blacks, but I have green, white & rooibos in my collection.  I usually drink premium loose leaf teas and brew them in either a french press or now, my new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK"">Adagio Teas 0 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> tea maker (I prefer the french press).  My usual favorite blacks run thirty to fifty a pound.<br /><br />When I opened the bag I was amazed at the smell...it was just as good as the berry tea at Wegman's (NE premium grocery chain).  I just made my first using the adagio ingenuiTEA brewer.  You can definitely taste the berry, but it's on the weaker side compared to Wegman's.  The tea was smooth and seems to be low in caffeine.<br /><br />I honestly don't think it's worth the MSRP of thirty eight per pound (or even the current price of thirty).  The only reason I took the risk on a pound was that, at the time I purchased, it was on sale and there was a coupon which brought it down to twelve per pound.  For the price I paid it's  a steal.  I have a feeling this will make some really incredible iced tea.<br /><br />FYI - My ratings are based SOLELY on the product itself and not the manufacturer, price, purchase, shipping or some other stupid reason.  All of those are NOT related to the product and can happen to any product you buy!!!  Come on people, when you write a review stick to the PRODUCT not some other random reason.",0
"All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.",0
"This tea is nowhere near sweet enough to be described as southern sweet iced tea, but adding a packet of Splenda to it makes an adequate approximation.",0
"To give this tea a fair shot, I first brewed it exactly as the box said to, and had a cup black, as I usually drink tea.  I was underwhelmed.  There just seemed to be some kind of stale taste there---it didn't taste sharp or whatever the taste is called that I like tea to have!  It wasn't just that it was mellow, you want that in a breakfast tea a little, but it just didn't have a standout taste, and it made the bitter bit of taste not something that complemented the tea flavor, but took away from it.  Then I tried it with sugar.  I liked it a little better that way, but no better than very basic tea like Red Rose or Salada.  Finally I brewed it strong and made ice tea.  I liked it the least that way.  The flavor issues came out more with the strong and the cold, and I didn't finish my glassfull.<br /><br />I like the ideas of this tea---that they are part of the ethical tea partnership and that the box is made from recycled materials, and I will certainly use the rest of the teabags, but it is not a product I would seek out or pay extra for.",0
"I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast.",0
"This mix makes wonderful crispy on the outside tender on the inside waffles however they were so sweet that by the time you put syrup or any other topping on it they get so sickeningly sweet you can hardly eat them.  Its like they put in too much vanilla or something.  To me the whole point of a waffle or pancake is that they be more of a plain base that compliments whatever toppings you choose to put on them.  They shouldn't compete with the flavor of the toppings.  With these being so sweet already it was just way too much.  Seriously, you could just butter and eat them with no additional topping.  Will continue to look for something more akin to original waffles and pancakes.",0
"**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.<br /><br />Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward ""Eddie"" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.<br /><br />""Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?""  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. ""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",0
"This popcorn pops well, minimal old maids, we have an electric popper. However it's a little bland, had to use more butter/salt than what we use with our standard popcorn.",0
"The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,""Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice"".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.<br /><br />I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with ""organic lemon juice"" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice.",0
"I bought these thinking they were something special but they are OK.  It's made of cocoa powder, etc. but after a while, they were OK.  I would not recommend buying more than one box if you are just trying it out for the first time.  There are two smaller bags in the box.",0
"This illy coffee drink tastes like a somewhat sweetened European roast coffee.  It isn't bad for flavor.  However, the company mixes in some ingredients that apparently are supposed to give the drink a smooth consistency.  These leave me with an odd mouthfeel and aftertaste that I never get from drinking coffee.  That detracts significantly from the experience.  I can't see spending this much on these drinks in light of that odd texture/consistency and aftertaste.  For the price, stick with real coffee or espresso.",0
"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.",0
"The smoke temperature is very low and it is difficult to get out of the canister as it crumbles when trying to spoon some.  It also evaporates quickly.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a>",0
"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.",0
"I received the Dark Chocolate variety.  It's very filling -- half a bar satisfies hunger.  However, it tastes moderately bad.<br />The taste is somewhat like a cherry-flavored chocolate filling or mildly like cherry-flavored cough syrup.<br />Eating one or two small bites a time is tolerable.  Eating more than half a bar at a time is difficult because of the taste.",0
"NOTE: Because Amazon has all of the ""Kind Healthy Grains Clusters"" reviews linked together, it is necessary for me to say that this review is for only the cinnamon and vanilla blueberry flavors.<br /><br />After trying Kind's cinnamon clusters and loving them, I was really excited about trying all of the Kind Clusters!  Unfortunately, I didn't like the vanilla blueberry at all and found that they actually turned me off about wanting any more Kind Clusters.<br /><br />While the cinnamon taste popped out as soon as the cluster hits my tongue, the vanilla blueberry didn't even taste like it was supposed to!  It tasted more like sour apple juice and less like any form of blueberry!  Plus, I didn't detect any vanilla flavor at all.  I really enjoyed munching on the cinnamon clusters by themselves as a light snack whenever I felt like nibbling.  However, I needed something to drown out the vanilla blueberry clusters' nasty flavor and wouldn't eat them without milk or yogurt.  I'm sure that the cinnamon clusters would have been just as delicious with those two additions, as well.<br /><br />Both of these flavored clusters only have molasses and evaporated cane juice as sweeteners; therefore, they won't be as sugary as some people like their snacks; however, this lack of refined sugar makes the clusters healthier than most foods on the market.  Besides the already-mentioned molasses and cane juice, other ingredients include the following: whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, cinnamon, sea salt, and Vitamin E.  The vanilla blueberry ingredients are different in that there is no cinnamon but there is vanilla extract, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, citrus fiber, and citrus pectin.  I'm baffled as to why plum and apple products are added to a supposedly vanilla blueberry food.  All the ingredients are without a doubt extremely healthy.<br /><br />A serving size is about 1/3 cup which has 120-130 calories, 3-3.5 grams of fat, and 5-6 grams of sugar.  Other nice things to note are the calcium, protein, and iron that are present.<br /><br />I love the cinnamon flavor and highly recommend it, giving it a rating of 4/5.  The vanilla blueberry flavor was repulsive to me, though, and I would only give it a score of 2/5.  Overall, Kind Clusters are a highly healthy snack that's easy to grab a handful of.  I recommend trying the cinnamon, although I warn against getting the vanilla blueberry.  As for whether or not to try other flavors, that's completely up to you.  I will probably not be doing so in the near future.",0
"This product is not bad but not the best either, and I actually didn't realize how small the Kartoffelns are. I had just tried Niederegger before buying this and it doesn't even compare to their quality. This product is VERY sweet and not the best Marzipan around, it's like the sugar is all you can taste. If you like sweet things you might not find it so bad, but be advised that the Marzipan quality is far much inferior than Niederegger. I gave it 3 instead of 2 Stars for the fast shipping and good product appearance!",0
"I'm disappointed in this popcorn. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be fantastic. I made it in my Whirley Popper. It doesn't even come close to movie popcorn. People complained that it was too salty. Not my batch. And, no buttery taste. Bummer......",0
"I have been trying to reduce fat, specifically the bad fats, in my diet lately, and try to find ways to increase fiber without eating things that taste like cardboard, so when I had a chance to try coconut manna, I jumped at it.  The packaging says it is a healthy substitute for butter, and can be used as a spread.  My mouth watered at the idea of a bit of this, some nutella, and a banana wrapped up in a whole grain wrap.  The potential here was exciting for someone who loves coconut like I do.<br /><br />The packaging indicated that the oil separates from the coconut, and you must put the container in hot water for five to ten minutes for everything to soften, so that you can stir it all up to a nice smooth consistency.  Sound pretty easy right?  Wrong.  I found after leaving the container in a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes, it was still too hard to stir.  It took three rounds of hot water bath-vigorous stir cycle to get this to wear I could use it.  I tasted it, and was sad that it did not taste nearly as good as I anticipated.  It also had a weird gritty texture, and overall I was not crazy about it.<br /><br />Since clearly this was not going to work as a spread for me, I instead used while cooking mulligatawny soup.  I had created a low fat version of the soup without butter, cream, or milk, so the coconut manna helped add a bit of richness to it.  However, it is still a bit high in calories to be something I would use daily.  I will probably continue using olive oil for much of my cooking, but I do plan on experimenting with the coconut manna when making smoothies, sauces, desserts, and ethnic dishes.  It did nicely in my soup.<br /><br />I am not completely sold on coconut manna, but I am not ready to give up on it either.",0
"It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on bread/toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture/taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.<br /><br />ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.<br /><br />Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.",0
"Nice product and convenient on-the-go packaging, but like another reviewer said, these taste like raisins.  Luckily, my daughter likes raisins, so she ate them.  I really wanted a cherry, though.",0
"The taste on this one is only ""so-so"", verging on downright bland.  Plus, it has a lot of additives and preservatives.  Since I like to feel a little burn on my tongue and don't want to glow in the dark, I'll stick with ""Shark"" brand sriracha sauce.",0
The flavour and texture of this is just OK.  Nothing great but not bad either.  It tastes somewhat like raw cookie dough with yogurt coating.  A little too sugary for me personally.<br /><br />Cheers,0
"I don't why it's labeled as ""Swiss Stake"", because it really isn't anything of the sort.  I was expecting something with roughly flavor of Swiss Steak as I have known it to be.  As I have always understood it (and have made it), Swiss Steak has a tomato-based sauce with onions and generally bell peppers and garlic, etc.  This product is NOT that at all.  Given the ""Swiss Stake"" product title. I couldn't even given this 1 star.  This is more of a ""Salisbury Stake"" in a standard brown gravy, that has no vegetables at all in it and tastes nothing like a Swiss Steak sauce would. This basically a soy ""hamburger"" patty in a smooth brown gravy.  Given that vegetarian ""meats"" have never really resembled the texture of their namesakes anyway, I didn't really expect (but WAS hoping) that the texture would resemble that of flank steak or round steak that Swiss steak is made with, but I DID expect the sauce flavor and components to resemble Swiss Steak.  It doesn't.  With a title of ""Salisbury Stake"", I'd give it 3 stars at best.",0
"I bought this because I heard a television talk show guest say juice with Resveratrol was more absorbable by the body than Resveratrol taken in capsules. Amazon's product description did not say how much Resvertrol, but my capsules were 1600 mg.  The juice that arrived only has 1 mg. per serving. I am now wondering if another brand has more, or exactly what amount if recommended. Oh, but it is delicious.",0
"This is not a bad coffee - it's smooth, has no aftertaste, not bitter, etc.  However, it really doesn't taste too much like chocolate or raspberry to me.  It can smell the chocolate and raspberry when I open the package and fill up the coffeepot, but it kind of ends there.  Once it's in my mug, I really don't taste anything other than coffee.  To me it has an ever-so-slight smoky (but not burnt!) flavor.  It's not unpleasant...it's just not chocolate or raspberry.",0
"I didn't realize there was sugar in the Stevia until it came.  It tastes really good, but I didn't want the sugar.",0
"First off, these are skinny, skinny noodles, more slender than normal wheat vermicelli, and as such much more delicate. The bag they came in did nothing to keep them from shattering in shipping, and every time I picked up the package I felt like I was breaking them more.<br /><br />Definitely read the directions when you go to prepare them. They say to soak for one minute and then basically just heat them up in whatever dish you're making. They need pretty much zero cooking, so would be great for making fast or on-the-go meals.<br /><br />But for dinners where you are home and happy to wait, other rice noodles are better. These have a slightly dingy flavor, probably from the fact that they're made of brown rice, and get soggy and pasty super fast. They ended up soaking up so much water that they tasted watery and made my Asian-inspired sauce taste bland. I'm used to cooking Asian rice noodles since we try to eat gluten-free, and while these aren't the worst I have tried, I'd prefer most brands over this one.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars for the fact that if I were to make my own instant ramen to take somewhere, this would def. be the brand I'd choose as they don't really need to cook like other brands do.",0
"I love drinking coconut juice even when I was still living in the Philippines where it was sold by a street vendor and opened right in front of you where he sticks a straw for you to drink right away the goodness and freshness of it. Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it. Maybe next time I'll try the tetra packed zico to see if I'll like it better.",0

They dont taste the greatest for a candy and don't foam all that much. They kinda taste like baking powere, but the other flavors are super delicious.  The energy flavor is great.",0
"My dogs love this.  But it's undeniably odd.  Basically, it's packaged like those old roller bottles of deodorant.  You hold the it in front of your dog's face and they lick the rollerball.<br /><br />One of my dogs wanted nothing to do with it, but my puppy (who'll lick anything) dove right in.  That lured the wary dog into trying it.  Now they both love it.<br /><br />Frankly, though, I suspect they'd prefer food.  And I certainly like tossing treats to my dogs for them to catch instead of standing there like a servant holding what looks like a bottle of deodorant as they lick it.<br /><br />Might be good for dogs on a diet, though. You can treat them with a bit of flavor without so many calories.",0
the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson.  It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.,0
"The chocolate Svelte flavor is good until two seconds after you drink it. The Stevia flavor is an unpleasant surprise that lingers. I needed the protein from the drink and was filled up by it. However, I felt like I was forcing down every swallow and dreaded the aftertaste. Cute designs but I guess I'll have to try some other flavors and see if it can mask the Stevia.",0
"This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.",0
"A couple of years ago I bought my husband some sugar free gummy bears and they were wonderful, very fruity and big. But I can't remember where I got them so I thought I'd try these, hoping they were the ones I remembered. Sadly, they aren't. These gummies are o.k. but they don't have the intense fruity flavor or the size I'm looking for. My husband still enjoys these but not as much as the last ones. If you want a gummy like most of the megastore sell then these are for you.",0
"this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.",0
"My wife absolutely loves it. I find the flavor much too strong and salty, so I leave it to her.",0
"The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps.",0

"I bought this for the price.  I have been a fan of Godiva's Hot Cocoa (Dark and Milk) for about a year.  While much better than those instant hot cocoa (Swiss Miss, Carnation etc) that are made with water - it leaves a slight aftertaste that I do not like.  Also, it did not mix as easily (dissolve) as the Godiva did.  I think it (like wine and food) is just a personal taste.  Try both brands and see for yourself.",0
"While I agree the taste isn't the greatest, neither is the fat on a body. This is not a product I would recommend switching to if you were simply looking for a jello pudding alternative. You will shock your taste buds! The product is geared for bodybuilders or people used to protein supplements.<br /><br />Another problem is almost as soon as the powder and water merge, it begins to congeal, making it difficult to scrape out of the blender or off the mixer paddles. In other words, you lose a lot of the pudding. However, the powder mix is cheaper than the can contained (premixed) protein puddings I have seen.<br /><br />As far as nutritional value, it is a worthwhile product. (145 cal, 3g fat, 4g carbs, 25g protein) The sodium is a bit high at 550 mg per serving. I usually have one serving if I find my protein is a bit short for the day, so it is not a staple in my diet. I don't think I would be able to eat one every meal or day! I'm leaning more toward obtaining an unflavored protein powder for my low protein days and eat the pudding only once a month or so.",0
"Yes, there was a flavor to the coffee but couldn't really identify it as nutty or chocolately.  Disappointed that those flavors didn't come through.

Do not buy this in the store, one bottle is the same price as all 3 of these!!!! We go through it so fast, I love purchasing online!",0
I love sweet potatoes. They are a nutritional powerhouse and great for diabetics. I eat them in a variety of dishes to stay lean and fit. I also love chips. Imagine my dismay when I thought the best of both worlds (sweet potato chips ) ended up tasting not much like either of those things. I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date .,0

"I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?",0
"My initial reaction, after trying a few flavors, was 'bleh!' and a solid 2-stars. After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE"">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92"">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.",0
"I ordered this mole sauce, rather than picking up a jar of Dona Maria at the local store, because I had read several reviews which claimed it was much better.  I disagree.  I found the Rogelio Bueno mole to be much sweeter, with more cinnamon; with less complexity and less chocolate and smoky flavors than the Dona Maria.  My husband compared the Rogelio Bueno mole to spicy gingerbread.  Everyone in my house strongly preferred the Dona Maria. I know mole varies greatly, but the Rogelio Bueno mole did not remind me of the mole I've had in Mexico.  I will not be buying it again.",0
"My cats love about half the Weruva flavors and most flavors look so good that I've been tempted to try them.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say is that the *Marbella Paella* includes calamari, but like everything else it isn't mashed down to little pieces.<br /><br />****One of the cans contained a 1.5 inch long WHOLE squid**** and it was rather big surprise for me to open the can and see that...  I'm not going to buy this type in the future.  I don't know if squids that size have bones in them or not, but if they do and I missed it my cat could have choked to death.<br /><br />If you buy this flavor, please check the contents of the can before giving it to your cat...",0
"I have 6 little dogs so I know dog treats! I usually order the chicken sticks but thought I would give these beef sticks a shot. My dogs take them but then drop them on the floor, which is where they stay. But on the chicken sticks, they are gobbled up quickly, which reminds me, I need to order another barrel of those tasty treats today! As for this experiment, I won't buy them again, dogs know what they like and it isn't these sticks.",0
"If I didn't know what it was, I could easily believe that this Illy Issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink was a new coffee flavored version of Yoo Hoo.<br /><br />I really like Illy coffee and cappuccino, but this doesn't taste much like either one of them. It tastes ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to ever have it again.",0
"When I first went gluten free I LOVED this mix.  It's easy to put together, versitile (pizza crust, pie crust, bread etc)  However it took me many many months to realize it was this mix that was causing my stomach to still hurt.  Badly.  I don't think it's the sorghum flour I'm leaning towards the chicory root maybe?  My mom has the same reaction to this as I do.<br /><br />If you are new to celiac, need somthing that will work with little effort than this is the mix for you (and deserves 5 stars).  If however, you have a sensitive stomach then I think you should try another mix.  I would definately suggest trying the small bag first and if you don't blow up like a balloon think about getting a larger amount!",0
"The product is great, I used to get it at Wal-Mart...but they quit selling it.  Shipping and handling is twice as much as the product - that kind of annoys me, but I ordered anyway.",0
"Just so you know...there was only one blueberry flavored lollipop in the entire container...only 3 mango flavored lollipop and just a few of the other flavors... most of the flavors that were plentiful in the container were razzaberry, and strawberry.

"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.",0
I am a meat lover and this makes a perfect snack for the road.  Inexpensive.  Can't say the taste is outstanding but is certainly not yucky.  Will get another box when this one runs out.,0
"These Pure Natural Bars are absolutely delicious and good for you, but not good for your waistline. Loaded with cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, they are simply a sticky and crunchy delight. All berries strengthen your artery walls and do wonders for your body, as do nuts, so these bars excel at giving you much more than fiber.<br /><br />Each bar has 190 calories, 100 calories from fat. The sodium is low at 95 mg and the cholesterol is zero. This is one of those treats that your body needs, but because of the fat calories- not that often. Two cupcakes also have 100 calories from fat, but of course don't give you this great artery protection and fiber. This is a great healthy bar to have once a week, but never daily, as it's difficult to burn off 100 fat calories.",0
"Some people are concerned about this product being made in China, personally I think it's fine, since it's from the largest rice cracker manufacturer in the world, they should have decent quality control systems-- after all, the ingredients from the frightening food scandals in China never appears in any of their product that's made in China. (Interestingly, some of their adult rice snacks made in Taiwan were involved).<br /><br />However, I hope I've read the nutrition facts before purchasing this product:it has sugar and sodium. Baby food are not supposed to have sugar and salt added into it. THEY ARE FOR ADULTS! Especially, the sodium per serving for this product is about 2/3 the value for reduce fat potato chips. Since you cannot return grocery purchases on Amazon, think twice before you buy this. My daughter is 8 months old, I'll probably give her this after she's 12 months old -- since I cannot return this anyway, but I won't give her too much in a day simply because of they added salt into this product.",0
"These are not K-Cups in the traditional sense, a filter vice the plastic cup bottom.  A big surprise when I opened the box that didn't make me happy.<br /><br />But they do take ya home to a night out camping under the stars and a morning sunrise to a cup of coffee over the fire.  A bit gritty, strong, and full of flavor.",0
"These taste ok but unfortunately for me they do not agree with my stomach, I plan to give away the rest of the carton.",0
"I'm not sure I'm making it right as I've never had it before, but it's pretty easy to make.<br /><br />I've been using part chicken broth to replace some of the water. I also add a little onion to it.<br /><br />I need to experiment more with spices, since made according to the directions, it's somewhat bland.<br /><br />I don't make a pound at a time (just how do I measure out a pound anyway?), I just use 1.5x liquid to Cous Cous, a little salt, and a little margarine or oil for each bowl. I make maybe a half cup at a time, since it's so easy to make.",0
"While it's been ages since I've eaten Taco Bell, it did at one point form a substantial portion of my diet. Those days are over, but when ths sauce was offered in the Vine program,I decided to give it a whirl for old time's sake.<br /><br />It tastes exactly like Taco Bell, which is to say: gross if you're not a Taco Bell fan, but I suspect familiar and tasty if you are.<br /><br />Personally, I was a little horrified to find my home-cooked tacos tasting like Taco Bell.<br /><br />So while I'd never buy or eat this myself, I'm also unlikely to deliberately eat Taco Bell, while anyone buying a Taco Bell condiment clearly favors Taco Bell flavors. So I'm giving it 3 stars. While I personally find it yucky and synthetic-tasting, it really truly tastes exactly like what you think when you think Taco Bell. Based on that, it lives up to expectations and would probably rate 5 stars if all food was graded only on the merits of its Taco Bellness. But we live in a world with other condiments, and this is pretty terrible by objective standards--something of an unholy union between that awful Taco Bell mild sauce and cheap bottled Ranch Dressing.<br /><br />However, given that only a numbskull would expect bright gourmet flavors from Taco Bell brand, it deserves 3 stars. If Taco Bell is what you seek, you'll find it here.",0
"I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is ""healthier"" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.",0
"This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their ""paranormal hosts"" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,""say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!""Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.",0
"My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley breastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non-gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this brand because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation/gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.",0
"I can understand how this appears to be a fairly good price as the k-cups expired back in July 2009... they are over a year old.  However, I do not notice a stale taste, but I wonder if I may be missing out on some freshness.  I plan to contact the seller and find out if all they sell is expired k-cups.",0
"You may well wonder why I gave this only 3 stars when I love it so.  I could eat the whole can all by myself.  I would also love it on some kid of pasta - or how about ravioli?  It would be perfect over rice.  Or over chicken thighs.  It has a perfect blend of mild Indian spices.<br /><br />It has a fatal flaw that makes me limit my intake:  It is way too salty.  This is not just my imagination.  The whole can would have over 2,000 mg of sodium.  Because of that I ration my intake.<br /><br />If the manufacturer reads this, perhaps they can cut back on the salt by about 40%  I imagine it would be just as good.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if this is a storage problem or not, but the cans look as if they either are old or have been stored in a damp place.",0
"Tried these pods because they were a good deal.  Used them with Pod adapter in keurig. The flavor is pretty good, but the pods are not that thick so it turns out as a weak cup of coffee.",0
"I absolutely adore these candies. I had them for the first time when a friend in middle school took me to an Asian grocery store. They're addictive!<br /><br />They are fizzy and have a particular flavor. It's definitely a ""cola"" flavor, but not a typical American cola flavor. Because I love these so much, and because I rarely often have a grocery store that I can purchase these at anymore, I am often hesitant to share these with friends/JiwaJiwa newcomers only because I've had a few people spit them out and that horrifies me! They are definitely not for everyone, but those people are missing out. So ha.<br /><br />The 3 stars I gave this candy is not for the actual product (which is 5 stars!) but for the price! $7.89? Seriously? I can pick this size of a bag up in any Asian grocery store for under $3. Heck, I think that CostPlus World Market even carries them sometimes! If you can find a local Asian grocery, I encourage it, who knows what else you'll pick up? It might be very exciting!",0
"This Pump does not really fit the 64oz. Ghirardelli bottle...it is too long for the bottle.  It's possible to push it down and twist it on, but the end of the tube is laying against the bottle, it doesn't go straight down.  It works for what it needs to do, but I wish it really fit the bottle.",0
"A couple of cooking forums I belong to highly recommend these tomatoes.  Since I couldn't find them locally (no surprise), I ordered them here.  After S&H, they were pretty expensive, so we did a 'blind taste test' between these & Progresso brand.  Progresso won!  The San Marzano were good, but not worth the price IMHO.",0
"I have been nurturing this starter for several weeks.  The second week I divided the activated culture into three separate containers, I used unbleached flour, whole wheat flour and a combo of unbleached and wheat.  The combo won the bubble contest.  I used some of the starter for making waffles and the flavor was unremarkable.  I had previously used a starter made with commercial yeast but wanted to try something new. I wish now I had not dumped it down the drain.  This starter is not at all sour but that could be because it is a new culture and because I have not used it for baking a slow-rise bread.  Time will tell.",0

"There are three ways you can judge Nabisco's SnackWell's Caramel Drizzle Popcorn:  taste, health/diet concerns, and price.  On the first count, these are excellent.  Given it mixes caramel and popcorn, there will inevitably be some similarly to Cracker Jack, but these have a far better flavor in my book.  On the diet/health side, the only major concern is the high sugar content but then the pluses elsewhere are likely achieved by the small package side more than anything.  Where it lets down is in the pricing.  $35 for a half dozen small bags of popcorn??  I might expect that in a movie theatre but not in the marketplace.  So give it 5 stars on taste, 3 on health/diet, and 1 on pricing.",0
"I bought this cake because I miss the seven layer cakes that are available in New York (where I grew up).  There was not enough cake.  And, the filling was not the light colored chocolate buttercream as shown in the picture. It was more chocolate frosting.",0
I cannot give a fair review of this product as I'm not sure if it helped or not. I paired it with Fenugreek and unfortunately did not see much of a change. Possible it was just my body though... May be helpful for others.,0
"Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it, it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!",0
"If what you are looking for is raisins and peanuts, the Emerald Hartmony Raisinberry Nut trail mix is fine. There are plenty of good quality peanuts and raisins in each package (9 oz.). But don't buy this if you really want cranberries, almonds or cashews, because there are very few of these treats. The yogurt covered raisins are very sweet. My carton was delivered on a sunny September day and when I opened the psckage 90 minutes after taking the carton out of the sun, the yogurt raisins were still melted.",0
"The coffee is not strong and you can taste the added flavors.  I first tried this as my first cup of coffee and decided it was definitely not the coffee I would start my day on. I prefer a stronger, bolder flavor for first thing. Love the taste of espresso double shots. I do like a flavored coffee, tend to go for one in the afternoon.  So I found this to be on the sweet side but then I never add any sugar or sweetener to my drinks. (nor syrup to my pancakes, gotta have butter) You get the idea I prefer savory to sweet.  If you like nut flavored coffee and chocolate you would probably like this. I like it.",0
"Taylor's Market is still Awesome.  This product is fairly plain with some decent heat.  Goes better with other sauces that need a little boost in heat.  Doesn't have a lot of body to it.  Is really good as a light baste on chicken, especially wings, to give it a little more kick.  I wish they'd lose the vinegar.",0
"I have about 20 cats so gave this product a true test. Results: some like it very much; some didn't...so it probably depends upon when you give your cats this product...<br /><br />Striper was my first taste tester...she went after it right away...but left it shortly thereafter...In fact, most of the cats and kittens did... it was too big for them! When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...",0
"Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.  The K-Cups still brew a decent cup of tea, although as you cannot control the steepage the tea comes out on the weak side for me.  While still tasty, the much greater expense ($0.45/cup vs less than half that for teabags) for the convenience may not add up for a lot of people. However, if you're go-go-go in the morning and don't have time it may be worthwhile.  I myself will be going back to teabags but will still use the Keurig to get fast hot water!  Best of both worlds!",0
"The Chewy Gooey Megafudge from Chips Ahoy was all right, but I certainly thought it could have been better. I didn't notice any real chocolate chips, and the cookies seemed very dry. The taste was just acceptable. I think  that I could go to the store and find something I liked better, probably at a lower price.",0
"The heat from this sauce is from habaneros, and it is a bit on the warm side compared to many habanero sauces with no pepper extracts.  The heat starts at about a medium level, then builds over the next few minutes to a fiery crescendo, and stays with you.  The product description is right on, this one will burn you more than once.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy, also having chipotles, garlic, onion, tomato, cumin and other spices.  The chipotle and cumin really add an earthiness to this sauce setting it apart from many others.<br /><br />It has a chunky texture with visible chunks of garlic, onion and spices.",0
"The previous ""Frosted Shredded Wheat"" made by Post---until last year, unfortunately---was much better...frosted on one side and not the other (like Kellogs' version).  This new ""Lightly Frosted"" version isn't nearly as good, even though the sugar content is the same as before.  It just doesn't pack the same punch when the sugar is coated around the whole biscuit.<br /><br />Still not a bad cereal, but I don't reach for it on the shelf quite as often now.",0
My 70lbs. lab/hound mix likes this toy OK. He hasn't figured out how it works to get the food out but he does like to carry it around in his mouth by the rope.

"Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.

"I love breakfast sausage, but have had difficulty in finding sausage that is just right. I tried Esposito's Finest Quality, even though it is expensive and was a large amount for a trial, in hopes it would be excellent. I am disappointed with the result. Overall the sausage is of high quality, but contains a lot of fat and its flavor comes mostly from salt. I would prefer less fat, but more importantly, better flavor- less salt, but more sage and other sausage seasonings. There is no accounting for taste and many people raved about this sausage so it is obviously right for many if not most people. Maybe that's why I can't find sausage I like, because my taste is not main stream. I will not purchase this product again, but have nothing against Esposito. In fact they sent a package of their Italian sausage as a sample and we loved it! I will look at the other items they offer and may purchase some of those, but I am still in the search for my kind of breakfast sausage!",0
"I've been using Swheat Scoop for about a year and have been pleased with it's clumping  and flushability. It does track out of the box, but the cats think it's good stuff. Apparently, mice think it's good stuff too. I discovered that the bag stored in my bathroom closet had been chewed through. Now that I removed the bag from the closet, the mice risked life and limb to get to the litter box and my cat has caught three of them in the past 24 hours. No more Swheat Scoop for me, now that the mice are onto it. Too bad -- it's a good product.",0
"The coffees are great, if you can get one that doesnt bust open while brewing and ruin your coffee! its good if you are looking for a bargain and dont mind making a second cup very once and a while, but if you use the keurig machine because you are a busy person, these coffees are not the right purchase for you. The flavor is though! just buy a normal sized package instead.",0
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",0
"First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.",0
"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.",0
I have just ordered this same product from Great Northern Popcorn website. It is about $30.00 cheaper than Amazon. Have not tried it yet so I don't know how it taste.,0
"I love kettle chips and I love spicy food. This is decently spicy but I don't think the flavor is that great. You definitely taste the vinegar in these, which I don't like. I want the vinegar taste to be mild and subtle but it is a bit strong for me. It's not overwhelming, just not how I like my buffalo flavor.",0
I have eaten the other pop chips and thought that these tortilla chips would be an exact match to the doritos and other junk food that my kids eat. But to my surprise these tortilla chips have no flavor. In the first bag it was all in the bottom of the bag. So the second back I shook the bag well to coat the chips and to no avail there still was no flavor. So if flavor is what you are looking for you do not want these but if you just want a low cal chip for a snack or with a sandwich then these are it.,0
"I ordered a large amount for a corporate contest and they arrived quickly but in separate shipments.

"It's a good base I like to start with, to save time. I use an Aldi's brand $20 electric ice cream machine, where you have to freeze the mixing container for 24 hours, instead of having to use rock salt and ice. If I had it to do over, I would have bought a better and bigger machine. However, it serves it's purpose. It works well for me, if I mix up half the contents of this packet with mostly 1% milk, using heavy or light cream for the last 1/8th cup. I also add a little over 1 tsp. peppermint liquid flavoring. Once I added both the spearmint and the peppermint, which turned out good. If you get too much, just add more cream or milk or both. I also add about 1/8 to 1/4 cup, semi sweet chocolate chips. Don't add too many. I'd also recommend grinding up the chocolate chips first. The consistency of the ice cream after 20 minutes is like a thick sorbet or soft serve, but not hard like ice cream. You can find the mix at Walmart for about $3. One packet makes 2 quarts. Walmart also sells the flavoring cheaper than my local grocers. I buy the McCormick peppermint and the spearmint is an off brand.",0
"I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.",0
"I was surprised at how different the ""low fat"" FriChik is from the traditional FriChik. Frankly, I don't see a reason for ""low fat"" in this vegetarian meat substitute. It now has the taste and texture of Loma Linda's  FriedChicken meat substitute, which I don't like at all.<br /><br />Amazon, please make the regular Worthington FriChik available for those of us who don't have a problem with fat. . . especially fat derived from soybeans and gluten! This stuff sticks in the esophagus unless one drinks a lot of fluids while eating it.",0
"Not sour as some of the other reviewers have stated. I for one could not really taste any sour bits, but it's a fine gummi candy on it's own. Sugar coated, etc. Just wish it was sour, or at least Hairbo made a 'proper' sour gummi candy.",0

"I'm a big fan of dark chocolate..But this bars weren't what I expected..The ingredients are healthy but they still need a little bit of sweetness in my opinion..May be some organic maple syrup or honey..My husband and I ate the banana ones..I'm still working on these ones..I got a whole box..I bought some chocolate mint,chocolate orange, coconut cream pie, apple pie and some other ones..They were delicious!! I just got one of each first..I'll probably order a variety pack from amazon!!",0
"If you like espresso, then you will probably like this coffee. The taste is strong and bold. It is mildly sweetened. One can (6.8 ounces) contains 50 calories and 155 mg of caffeine.Yikes!

"Have you ever picked thru mustard seeds?<br /><br />I found these seeds to be debris ridden: husks, brown mustard seeds, green spheres of something, black pyramidal seeds of unknown origin, even brown rice.

"Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep.",0
"I recently purchased this item and tried my first cup last evening. A bit of an aftertaste sent me searching for the ingredients list, which is not on the individual cup but is on the original packaging. Sucralose is hiding in the ingredients, which, while not a big deal, is not a taste I enjoy. Prospective buyers should be aware of the presence of an artificial sweetener, which is not advertised or noted in any way in the product description on Amazon. (The manufacturer website notes that both natural and artificial sweeteners are used.) It's certainly something I'll be checking before making future purchases of this type of item. Overall flavor (except for the sweetener issue) is acceptable but don't look for rich, creamy body with this beverage.",0

"You can get better tasting Kona coffee than the price I paid. Roughly 26 bucks for a pound The real reason I got it was it could be shipped with Amazon prime. If this is the reason you want it. It is not bad but next time I will wait for better coffee at the same price. It has a slightly bitter taste. Tastes better than what I would get at starbucks or the supermarket but if you are wanting to duplicate  your memories of Kona coffee go elsewhere. Packaging is a big plus for this product though, for those of us that are too lazy to grind our own beans.",0
"The quality of the syrup is good, but the flavor seems to have this odd sort of aftertaste that reminds me of wintergreen lifesavers.  The syrup is a little heavier than other syrups - that's fine.  Nobody at my house is lining up to make root beer with this Amoretti syrup.",0
"I used to have Hamburger Helper (HH) as a kid.  But when I became an adult, I bypassed the HH for something cheaper, making cheese sauce myself.  So I usually make a roux and then add pasta to it.  This meal is better tasting then I thought it would be.  It comes with a spice pack, cheese sauce pack and pasta.  You supply the meat.  I personally wouldn't buy the product for $2.50 a box when I can buy a bag of pasta on sale at my local supermarket for $1, then add spices already in my cupboard and then make a roux, which yes, takes 30-40 minutes instead of the 20 here.  I have no kids and my boyfriend and I have time to cook, so time isn't too tight for us.  Even with a a dollar or two of real cheese added to my recipe, I'd rather know what I am eating for $3 (which really would make twice as much pasta as the pasta that came in the box) then eat something loaded with odd ingredients I don't know.<br /><br />Despite this, the skillet meal is easy to prepare, even an older kid could probably do this and it would save time for busy adults.  It tastes ok. The spice gives it a Mexican sort of appeal and I ate it as shown on the back of the box, with shredded lettuce and onion.  I do think that most of the money you pay for this item goes into packaging and the design of the box.  Since I am not eating the box, I'll stick to my own cheese sauces, thanks!<br /><br />Note:  I did use very lean beef for this meal and it came out rather cheesy, which was a good thing.",0

I have been getting these chips for my dogs for a long time.  I have noticed lately that the chips are thicker and therefore the weight of the box is more so for a 9 oz box I may only get 6 or 7 chips and I have 4 dogs.

I suppose I would buy this again, but not before shopping around and trying a different decaf.",0

"I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.",0

"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.",0
"I did a lot of research before purchasing these bags. I looked at various brands of breastmilk storage bags as well as researching oxo plastics as I was unfamilar with them. From my research I ended up choosing purchasing over the lansinol ones.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />1. These have a reinforced bottom, lansinol do not.<br />2. The side seams are a lot thicker than the lansinol ones, so would presumably be stronger.<br />3. The biodragradable factor, this can only be a good thing right? While researching oxo plastics I discovered that oxo plastics are FDA approved and are safe for food storage and do not contain any BPA (lansinol bags are also BPA free). Oxo plastics can be manufactured to degrade quicker or slower depending on the manufacturers needs, therefore if you wish to compost them I would suggest contacting the manufacturer to find out the degradation time. That oxo plastics need oxygen to degrade so they would not degrade well in landfills as most landfills currently inoperation do not have an atmosphere conducive to biodegrading as they are so deep and compacted that there is not enough oxygen. But surely any amount of degradation is better than the alternative bags?<br /><br />After receiving the bags I conducted a few experiments with these bags and a few of the lansinol ones I had received in a couple of boxes of the lansinol disposable breastpads.<br /><br />Conclusions.<br /><br />1. Apon examining the two different bags I noticed that the lansinol ones are marked with the reccyling symbol and the number 4. If you have access to recycling and are diligent in sorting your recyclables it would actually be better for the environment to use the lansinol ones.<br />2. I took one of each type of bag and stretched each bags seams and bottoms, neither bag gave way and seemed to still be in good condition. I then fill these bags with water, sealed them and then squeezed the bags to see if either would leak, the honeysuckle one did leak at the seem right underneath the zipper, the lansinol had not leaks.<br />3. I took two new bags, one of each type, and over filled them with 7oz of water in each. I then squeezed them to check the seams, neither leaked. I froze them flat and then thawed each in a seperate bowl, neither leaked during the freezing or thawing process.<br /><br />Both bags should hold up well to use following the maufacturers directions. If you have recycling in your area I would suggest the lansinol ones, if you do not have recycling then I would suggest the honeysuckle. Once I have used these up I will be switching to the lansinol ones. If you want more info about oxo plastics this website is quite informative. [...]",0

This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.

"I have lots of these products - I'm a big fan of Kenra Platinum Silkening Gloss, Moroccanoil and BioSilk (love the strawberry smell). I feel like Moroccanoil darkens my blonde hair, Biosilk leaves it greasy, and the Kenra Silkening Gloss is not always easy to find. That said, it works great for my brunette 7 year old, but she complains that her scalp is itchy (dry) now that we've entered the dry, heavy swim season. As a cycling commuter, I wash my hair a lot, which drys my scalp. Neither Biosilk or the Kenra product work very well on dry hair. So, this seemed a good fit.<br /><br />It comes in a small bottle with a nozzle. Are you supposed to drizzle it on your scalp? I found this really awkward at first. It works though, and it is a very runny consistency. So, I appreciated the nozzle the first time the bottle tipped over and nothing spilled.<br /><br />I think the idea is that after a few days of use, your scalp should be nourished and your hair less dry. I have not found this to be true after playing with the amount I have added. Adding it to my wet hair has done nothing. I have very, very thick hair - and quite frankly I am not sure how well a job at getting to my scalp I have done. It does seem to have helped my daughter. I have added it to her hair only dry. It has not left either of our hair greasy. I notice no added shine even combing it through.<br /><br />I looked at the other reviews, and people commented on the smell. I cannot smell it. Neither can she. Perhaps I am not adding enough. However, I have been adding about a walnut size amount (way more than the pea size the other products require). Keep in mind we are outside A LOT and our hair is being washed quite a bit, so I think that explains a lot of greasy vs. not greasy variables people report. At this rate, it won't last long.<br /><br />Bottom line: Maybe it takes a long time to work, but I am not going to recommend this one based on our very average at best results. I tend to have sensitive skin and have had no reaction to this at all. I will keep using it until it is gone and update if my opinion changes.",0

Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid ""bite.""  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!

"SUMMARY:<br />Ok so this is a long review, but the short summary is that although i regularly consume 5-Hour energy i do so with the knowledge that the effect i am feeling is mostly from the caffeine, and this effect is the same as caffeine consumption in coffee form, this also includes the ""crash"" later. The vitamin-B's added have as far as i have been able to find very little evidence supporting any effect, and at large doses some are toxic. I buy it in general because of the convenience of the concentrated form, and the fact that it is not calorie laden to the extreme (a la Starbucks). That said i could not find any evidence suggesting that 5-hour energy has any effects which makes it preferable to coffee<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Let me start out by saying that i am an avid 5 hour energy drinker. As a university student i go through at least a few every time a major exam week is coming up. Being a Psychology student with a focus on Neuroscience i decided to actually have a look at the contents of 5-Hr and and the scientific basis which merits its inclusion in the energy drink. Drugs that affect the body are intrinsically very complicated with many different effects on different parts of the body, so this is not a complete picture and will often be a very simplified one, but i think it will do for our purposes here.<br /><br />Caffeine:<br />5 hour energy contains caffeine, this i am sure comes as no surprise to anyone. What might be a surprise is that caffeine is a drug, this only means that it has a physiological effect on the body, but it is important for several reasons. One is that there is quite a lot of evidence for the buildup of both addiction and tolerance to caffeine, most people that regularly consume caffeine do build up tolerance, requiring larger consumption for the same effect .Without getting too technical caffeine works by effecting receptors on cells called ""neurons"", caffeine is what is called a ""direct antagonist"" to adenosine receptors. That means caffeine inhibits neurons from reacting to adenosine (it sort of works like a ""cap"" on top of the receptors stopping adenosine from attaching there). this inhibitory effect ""increases"" cerebral (brain) blood flow, as well as decrease the effects of adenosine on the brain, adenosine builds up in the body over an entire day, and seems to play an important part in promoting sleepiness. By blocking these receptors caffeine temporarily reduces the feeling of being tired. It does however in no way reduce the need to sleep overall, as adenosine is still building up in the body even when you have consumed the caffeine. It is like being under water, caffeine can act as a ""air bubble"" isolating us from the water for while, but once the air is used up you still need to deal with the water, in the case of adenosine, this means sleeping.<br /><br />The ""crash"" after caffeine consumption is simply the neurons again being affected by adenosine, so you are now feeling how tired the body really is, as caffeine has built up while you have been under the influence, the subjective experience is from a higher high then you were before to a lower low. The importance of this is that as far as i know there is NO WAY to remove this effect, unless more caffeine is consumed. As such the claim that there is ""no crash later"" sounds very disingenuous to me. There is also conflicting evidence as to whether or not caffeine improves mental alertness or just increases cognition in addicts back to a non-addict baseline, however as far as i know there is no consensus in either direction, and i am not willing to spend hours interpreting the papers dealing with this issue.<br /><br />Various vitamin B:<br />There is a lot of misconceptions out there as to what vitamins actually are. Vitamins are defined as any organic compound needed in tiny amounts that the body needs, but does not produce. So by definition we need Vitamin B, however that does not mean taking lots of them is good for you. Its a bit like saying ""well the body needs carbohydrates to survive, so the more i eat the healthier i will get"". So the question is not if vitamin B are effective (they are) but if they have an effect in large doses. Virtually everyone gets all the vitamin B the body needs, the one exception is usually pregnant women and vitamin B9.In general there is little to no evidence of positive effects on cognition or attention after consumption of any vitamin B, vitamin B is liquid soluble so most of it simply passes right through the body. The one *possible* exception is that there are some exploratory studies finding that vitamin B6 consumption in children with ADHD leads to better attentiveness and cognition. However these studies (at least the ones i was able to find) are generally small (30-50 participants) and thus unreliable. Even if there was a link this would most likely be linked to a specific deficit in people with ADHD, not the population as a whole. I also found several meta-analyses (papers reviewing other papers) that suggested no link between vitamin B6 (or B12) and increased cognition or attention.<br /><br />There is however a danger associated with some vitamin B's if consumed inappropriately. Overdosing on vitamin B6 and B3 is toxic to the body, so don't consume more than 2/day (recommended max from 5-hr themselves) for extended periods of time, it is well documented that vitamin B3 overdosing is associated liver damage in large quantities, while vitamin B6 is associated with nerve damage at high quantities the FDA sets their upper daily limit at 100mg which is roughly 70 times their recommended dosage, a bottle has 40mg B6 so you can do the math from there.<br /><br />Energy Blend:<br />So this is the shortest section because there is not really a lot to say, Glucuronic acid is sometimes used for more effective delivery of drugs, but doubtful that that is effective here. The much touted Taurine is also a non-story with the EFSA (think european FDA) stating that there is no effect positive or negative from the levels presented in energy drinks. at least one study suggests Citicoline might have some positive effect on memory in people with dementia, but i was unable to find a study which dealt with a healthy population.<br /><br />So why do i continue to consume 5-Hour? even though the vitamin B has little proven effect, the caffeine does, in the sense that it acts the way one would expect it to. I consume it because it is more convenient to bring around then coffee, is consumed faster, and tastes quite good (in my opinion), and at $1.70 a bottle, its cheaper than Starbucks and far less unhealthy.",0
"I like Bugles, but I didn't like the overall result with this particular version.  I was put off by the rather icky pasty coating of chocolate and peanut butter that covers each Bugle piece.  I thought it detracted from the Bugle flavor and texture, and that the Bugle part detracted from the chocolate and peanut butter flavors (which are not that great to begin with in this product).  They don't taste bad, but the overall effect is sort of limp and rather off-putting, even in the appearance.",0
"My Basenji & Australian Shepherd find these cookies boring, but they're half the price of the other treats I normally buy, & are corn & wheat free.<br /><br />The solution: an economy size jar of peanut butter.  Suddenly these cookies work.<br /><br />They also look funny while eating it.",0
"I am a frequent imbiber of chai tea lattes, so I was excited for this almost instantaneous approach to making the delicious beverage. Unfortunately, I found the product too spicy for my tastes. If you like a good jolt to your taste buds, this drink is for you. If you prefer something smoother and milder, look elsewhere.",0
"It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better.",0
I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.  Overall they are ok/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area.,0
"Great taste, but not many of the treat clumps shown. It doesn't seem that the boxes got crushed at all, so it might just be the way the cereal is being made. Almost more like crumbs than anything else",0
"So my wife and I wanted to make baby food for our wee lass. We started out excited about the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQCOIS"">Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker</a> and after reading the reviews and getting our hands on it we changed our mind. Simply put there are three BIG problems.<br />1. It is hard to keep clean especially the reservoir.<br />2. It has a limited lifespan since all it makes is baby food.<br />3. It is very expensive for what you get.<br />Since we were free of the Bebycook we now had some money to spend so I bought a beautiful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KQ66VY"">Mauviel M'Cook 5 Ply Stainless Steel 8 Inch Steamer Insert</a> to cook her food in. Then I bought a restaurant quality 1-quart ""Mouli Food Mill"" made by L. Tellier to puree her food in. Finally I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027UYT4O"">Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Green</a> freezer tray to store her food. Believe it or not the Beaba Babycook cost the same as a Mauviel steamer and a LT Mouli food mill combined, both of which are top of the line dishwasher-safe 18/10 stainless steel cooking masterpieces made in France. After your little one starts eating 'real' food the Beabe Babycook is just a hard to clean useless plastic paperweight made in China. But the steamer and the mouli are both essential kitchen tools that will last a lifetime of steaming broccoli and making home-made apple sauce. Yum...",0
"My wife is Indian and loves Chai tea, but we're busy people and it takes a long time to make it properly. She has tried the following:<br /><br />  1. Starbucks Chai Latte (from Starbucks)<br />  2. Starbucks Chai (concentrate, the cardboard box with the syrup in it)<br />  3. Trader Joe's Spiced Chai (powder)<br />  4. Oregon Chai (powder and liquid)<br />  5. Some other Chai powder that Costco had a few years ago but I don't remember the name now.<br /><br />Except for #1 (which is crazy expensive at >$[...] a cup), the rest have been lackluster. But then she found Twinings Indian Spiced Chai Tea which is exactly what she was looking for, but you can't find it in every grocery store.<br /><br />Follow the instructions (1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup water, 2 tsp sugar, tea bag) and you'll make a perfect cup every time, at like 1/20th the price of Starbucks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now that they have changed the product from ""Indian Spiced Chai"" to just ""Chai"", it is nowhere as good.  I have to reduce my 5 star rating to 3.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Here's her new favorite: Yogi Chai Rooibos, also available from Amazon.",0
"I wanted to really like this cereal.  We are big into old fashioned oatmeal for breakfast, as well as cooking with oats, in cookies and breads.  A ready-to-serve oat cereal, with enough actual oats in it to count, would be nice.  Unfortunately, we are underwhelmed by this product.  It has an unappetizing rather gray color.  The texture is a bit ""off"".  And the taste is bland... VERY bland.  The cinnamon is almost unrecognizable.  For the amount of sugar in it, it's not very sweet tasting.  In general, we don't really care for it much.  Sounds good, but we'll stick to oatmeal....",0
"not quite what I thought they would be (each box is small)--however, these are tasty & it is really easy to eat half the box of thins without realizing it. Expect crumbs all over.",0

"My dogs did love these right off the bat but got tired of them within a couple days.  Even after I put them away for a while and then re-introduced these, my two dogs (60lb shephard/lab mixes) didn't feel all too keen on them over time.  They chew through many things like their life depends on it so I purchased these rings due to their durability.  However, the nylabone material hardens and becomes very ""spiky"" that gets caught in my pups' teeth when ripped off and punctures my skin when accidentally stepped on.",0
"This is going to be a weird review for me :) I got 2 pkgs of these and at first taste I thought they were toOOOoOOoo sweet. Now, I am not a super big sweets fan, although I do like a very chocolate cake with a very chocolate icing etc, I prefer pasta or cheeses to cookies :)  So, I took the spare pack to work with me. This was a great idea because I get to pass along a LOT of thoughts in one review! Everyone said they were very, very sweet. So, the consensus is that if you don't mind sweet (like canned frosting taste, and sweet, and very little Oreo flavor mixed together with sprinkles on top) then you will LOVE LOVE these cookies!! That is exactly what they taste like! Also, if you love cute cookies, we all agreed they are adorable. Sprinkles!! How cute! Little layers inside! So cute!<br /><br />They are super melty. I had HAD to keep em in the fridge. A good note for whatever plans you may have. Also, they do have a very strong scent. Personally, and this is the weird part, I could sleep in this bag! I used to buy these amazing air fresheners that were marketed as vanilla. Well, every time ANYONE came in my house they were so disappointed that I wasn't baking a treat. Over and over: Sorry, it's just my air freshener. Sorry..."" Sigh. Well, these smell exactly like it! Yummy, vanilla, cookie cake smell. Love it.<br /><br />I don't know how this all adds up for you. I won't be buying them again because of my not loving super sweet stuff. But if you do, you should give them a try. If your darling daughter loves tea parties, she would love these too! Oh, by the way, they are much smaller than any oreo. These are a pretty slim cookie.",0
"This green tea has good flavor and is priced well but lots of stems compared to the other gunpowder green teas I have bought.  If it weren't for the stems, which leads me to believe it is a lower grade, I would give a higher rating for it's flavor.",0
"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!",0

"We received a sample can of this ""Blue"" formula from the hospital after our baby was born and we used it when we needed to ween from breast to bottle and the baby drank it normal. She got a bit fussy more and more and on a whim we decided to try the ""Similac Sensitive"" formula in the ""Orange Can"". Wow what a difference. Our baby drank more of it, it was easier to mix (blue kind of clumpy), and she was less gassy and fussy. It's the same brand Similac only in the orange can. A couple of bucks more is more than worthwhile. Still Similac should get 5 stars but only get 3 on the blue can.",0
"I would like the product be more soft and not to sweet, but the taste is good. I'm not going to by again.",0
My children and I did not care for the taste of the drink.  I like the idea of the drink but not the taste.  I will have to try other flavors.,0
Look for malt vinegar in your local store. This took a few weeks to get and cost about $20 but then I found local GREAT holander house malt vinegar at Winco for 1.78 per 12oz. About two of those bottles were equal to this bottle...,0

"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",0
"I recently tried the new Mountain Zevia. It's a zero calorie soda which tastes decent if your into that. I'm not really into the whole zero calorie soda, but it would be great for anyone watching their weight or someone with diabetes while wanting a nice, cool, and refreshing pop to wash down their meal with. I got the chance to try both the Cola and Mountain Zevia flavors. After letting them cool down in my fridge, I drank the Cola one first. It has very particular taste to it. It tastes kind of metallic and truly yucky. Again I don't drink coke zero or anything. Mountain Dew and Pepsi with all the bad sugar and calories is for me! Lol. So I don't know how competing drinks would taste. I ended up finishing the Cola flavor drink (not something I recommend). I took a break from the stuff, and with the upcoming dinner I drink the second can of Zevia ironically the flavor is called Mountain Zevia. Probably their signature can. All aside it tastes a lot better than the cola flavor. The sweetener is what really makes or breaks a soda. I just can't get use to the natural sweeteners used in these more ""healthier"" drinks. But as everyone knows it's how your raised and what your use to that determines how your taste buds react to the flavors. It's something that would take a little getting use to if your not normally a zero calorie soda drinker, but if you are one I recommend you try the Mountain Zevia (it's like Mountain Dew just with natural sweetener) before the cola. Right now they are on sale on Amazon for select Zevia Cans. But for a 24 pack the general price range is $27.00 without the sale going on with them right now. Not something I'm willing to spend $27.00 for every 24 pack I get. What I liked the most about Mountain Zevia was the colorful cans (they are fairly eye-catching and color popping). Other than that the taste is downright awful with the cola flavor and bearable with the Mountain Zevia flavor. I had my girlfriend and her family try them too. None of us really liked them (it's really a hit and miss). Some will like it, while others probably will agree and say it's not for them. Overall the key word is that they are decent, and that if your looking to watch your weight there are plenty of other cheaper and more flavorful options. (:",0
"I loved the idea of this snack. As others mentioned, enough crunch and volume that it is hard to finish a bag. The flavors are not that great. I really like Honey Mustard and Onion flavored snacks but the smart fries, not so much. My six yr old loves snacks but not even the cheddar was appealing to her.",0
Great product by Iams but my two mini pinschers would not eat it until they were starving.  I had them on the yellow package puppy Iams and they seemed to like that more.  Don't get me wrong the product is solid with healthy ingredients but my dogs just wouldn't take it.,0
"Yogi Ginger Tea is great for soothing stomachaches, but I can't say much about the taste. Pepper is the overwhelming flavor in this tea, and I wish the tea were sweeter. It tastes exactly as if you soaked ginger slices in water.",0
This tea has a nice flavor and is nice to drink in the evening (with most of the herbs being traditional evening  flavors).  But the tea itself is not a sleep aid or sleep supplement.  Its 25 mg of Valerian is several hundred times less Valerian than a standard Valerian extract pill.  They add an extremely small amount of Valerian so they can charge more for a 'medicinal' product - note the warning that you should not operate machinery.  My advice is spend a dollar less and get yourself regular Sleepytime.  It's a great tea.,0
"We love Runts so when I found this item on here I was excited to order a bunch at one time, at a good price.  The runts arrived in a standard plastic bag type package through US Mail.  The outer plastic US Mail bag was almost completely distroyed, so the post office somewhere put another clear bag around it and tape the heck out of it.<br /><br />The runts were also in two plastic bags, within the US Mail bag and both of those bags were also torn.  Being that we have no idea who or what might have touched the candy, we asked for a refund.<br /><br />They were prompt on responding to my request for a refund, and took care of the problem for us.  Really great delivery time and such, they just need to box them up and charge for delivery.<br /><br />We would not have had any issues again, I might order from them again if they could assure me that they would be shipped in a safer manner.",0

"Organic compounds contain carbon. Salt- sodium chloride, NaCl- is inorganic.<br /><br />Even using the silly redefinition of ""organic"" which took over six years ago, it makes no sense to ask whether salt was ""organically grown"" -- it's a mineral, for pete's sake! Of course it's not genetically engineered etc. The USDA grudgingly started dealing with ""organic"" certifications for plants and livestock, but they won't touch claims of ""organic salt."" Only three organizations (one in France, one in NZ, and one in Wales) with dubious credentials have tried to buy into the ""organic"" craze by certifying ""organic"" salt.<br /><br />Nothing against this salt- I'm sure it's fine. But any other natural sea salt will be just as good. Don't pay extra for a meaningless label.",0

"Certain fragrances put my sinuses in a spin the minute my nose invites them in. That's just what happened the moment I smelled this shampoo.  If you happen to be sensitive to odors, I doubt you'll want Clear Scalp.  I don't know what the chemical is that bothers me, but it's a synthetic throb of a smell that's become less common as fruiter scents entered the market.  It's hard to describe, but years ago, Clairol's after-coloring conditioner had it, as did Pantene.  (I sniffed the latter in the market today -- like Clairol, it no longer contains that odor.)<br /><br />To be fair to Clear Scalp, I'm an extreme overachiever when it comes to having a picky nose, but my encounter with this particular product ended with me popping a sinus pill and a couple aspirin after getting a dab of shampoo on my hand.  (I rinsed it off quickly but the odor clung to me for hours, faint but twinge-inducing if I got my hand near my face.)  Consequently, I didn't dare use it or the conditioner on my hair.  I'd have to give it one star.<br /><br />My husband, however gives it four stars, knocking one off because he doesn't love the fragrance. (He doesn't actively dislike it, but prefers coconutty scents.)  He loves what it does to his hair -- and I can see (and feel) why: his hair feels silky and thicker because the shampoo (and conditioner) give it more body.  It looks good.<br /><br />As for the odor, he there wasn't a trace of scent left tonight, nor are my sinuses bothered when I sniff his hair.<br /><br />The shampoo definitely does nice things to your hair, but I'd suggest a test-sniff before purchasing.",0
"It's nice having an emergency stash of gun laying around, but it seems like it might be shipped a bit old. It was a bit tough and bland. Still edible.",0

"If you happen to dote on dried very tart cherries I suppose this is better quality than some. It disappointed us after all the good reviews. The texture was like very large raisens. The taste was not just tart but really sour. The only sweetness was from the added sugar, not the cherry juice you might expect. I think you'd have to be a special sour cherry lover to enjoy snacking on this product, and I don't think most kids would go for it. I'm not sure we'll be able to finish our first order.",0
"The Good: Easy to use and the mutt (my sweet Doberman, Zoe Washburne) loves it so much she'll go to the refrigerator and hope I get some out for her.<br /><br />The Bad: And this one is ""my bad"" as I was in a hurry and didn't take the time to check out the shipping costs. $6.99 for the roll and $7.99 for the shipping makes sure I'll never order it from these folks again. Not their fault, mine for not looking more closely.<br /><br />A little more Bad: Natural Balance appeared on my list of tainted pet foods and treats. I don't know if the lamb and rice treat was one of the banned items but, guess what?, the dogs doesn't get any more of it until I know for sure it's ok.<br /><br />If I ever get to a store that has it after the pet food scare is over I might pick up a few rolls. Otherwise, no. Just too freakin' expensive to order here.",0
"This cereal tastes great, and it is hard to find many items that the kids will eat.  However, I was surprised when looking at the label, that most of the nutrition content only improved slightly by adding milk.  Otherwise, there is no nutritional content to justify this as ""healthy"".  Be sure to check the label before ordering, I wish I had.  There are other things that are gluten free, that would provide more nutritional value.",0
The candy was as described and just as I remembered it as a kid.  I normally get the atomic fireballs.  I have been eating those for years.  The only issue I had was the $8 for shipping them.  I figured that meant they would be shipped in a good box and secured.  I ended up getting them shipped in a bag with no packing or anything.  They were shoved in my mailbox and at least 10% of them were crushed or damaged somehow.  For $8 I really expected the shipping to be first rate.  Do yourself a favor and do not order anything from anyone unless it is shipped directly from amazon.,0
"I was a little disappointed in this product.  I do buy more and more dehydrated vegetables, finding them more flavorful than canned or freeze dried.  These tomatoes disappointed me.  If you cook them too long they lose their flavor.  But I have used sun dried tomatoes, several different brands, and I guess I expected their intense flavor. I plan to stick with sun dried from now on.",0

"I typically enjoy other Nature Valley products, like the peanut butter granola bars and sweet & salty nut bars. I thought I'd give these a whirl.<br /><br />They do have quite a bit of flavor, although I could do without the sunflower seeds. Also, I appreciate that Nature Valley is producing products that are gluten free, which can be hard to come by. But why do they have to be so hard and dry? They crumble very easily and are extremely messy; do not attempt to eat them in the car. Because of this even opening one package can be dangerous, as they are typically not whole once they've been shipped. They tend to crumble inside the package.<br /><br />I'd like to see Nature Valley improve upon these, because they do taste good and they are gluten free.",0
"I was looking for a mixture of healthy beans to add to my homemade salads.  I was a bit disappointed in that they are coated in a red, spicy, almost oily liquid.  So, to use them, I drain and rinse them, before using them.  But, I still know they are a healthy addition to my lunch.",0

"This beverage was very interesting. It had a nice passion fruit flavor, and there were chunks of what I assume is aloe. It was also very sweet, so would probably taste a lot better if it's diluted with sparkling water. I did expect a lighter flavor so that it would let the flavor of the green tea come through somewhat, but it didn't really, and just tasted like juice to me.",0

"I love PB and can't eat it at all during my cutting phases because I tend to eat way too much of it and go over my calorie and fat limit for the day.  (It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!)  I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad.  But I still can't eat as much of it as I want.<br /><br />As soon as I saw this, my first thought was ""SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!""  I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product.<br /><br />Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of.  I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product.  If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this.<br /><br />It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself.  I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder.  The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture.  After all that, it's really not bad.  I'd even say pretty good.  Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat.  This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly.  And I'll use it with the peanut butter mix on light wheat bread, and you have a fairly good 200 calorie PB&J sandwich (that's 1/4 the calories and fat of a normal PB&J).",0

"I like mini-wheats in general for the fibre content. So I was looking for a nice flavored variety and decided to try this out.<br />The taste is where I had a problem with this. It's sweet enough, but the cinnamon seems to leave a bit of an after taste. That's the main reason I'm rating this lower.<br />Otherwise, it's pretty good. The size of the bites is nice - I like that it's smaller. You can control better how much you want to serve.<br />Maybe I'm being a little too picky with the taste.

"I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of ""Lickety Stik"" over when I went to pick up my dog. Offered it to both dogs. The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention",0

He eats most of it, but seems to stop chewing when he feels the little pieces in his mouth or tongue.<br /><br />Cheaper to buy from Amazon for a pack of 12 with Subscribe and Save!",0
If you like really strong coffee this is for you!!! Emeril definitely takes it up a notch!,0
"Hmmm. Maybe it's just me but this ""green"" tea brews brown. I snapped up a box of this at my local supermarket since I didn't have time to drive across town to the asian market for my usual brand. The taste of this is fine but it does seem to taste more like a mild black tea. Maybe this is a bad box or maybe the decaffeinating process has effected the cathechins and thus the color? I don't drink this stuff for the flavor or color. I want to be antioxidized to the max so I think I'll be buying my other brand of tea next (it's packaged in Japan and not the US for whatever it's worth.)",0
"Aroma is super, but flavor is lacking.  This is better when creamer and sweetener are added to bring out the flavor which tends to wash out.",0
"This shake tasted decent if warmed up however I was hungry after 3-4 hours, other shakes I have tried lasted longer. Mixing with milk was better than water and definitely mix before heating up, it would not mix at all if you just add hot water. I didn't quite get the energy boost that other reviews provided, definitely more of a morning drink with breakfast not a breakfast replacement.",0
Barberesco comes from ther same grape as Barolo but isn't as full bodied. I think this wine is slightly on the thin side but tastes very good. The kit didn't have oak chips so I added my own. I've made wine from kits for 10+yrs and for the money these are a good value for making table wine. I will buy more of these kits and add my own ingredients to make give the wine more body. See my blog at [...],0
"This is a fine product.  I think if it had more complexity of flavors, it might be worth the price.  But if this was something more than just an occasional treat, I'd recommend going to a health food store and buying bulk plain whole grain granola and adding dark chocolate chunks.<br /><br />That said, it is good.  The chocolate is tasty, with the granola and alone.  The kids like it, but I don't really want to give it to them because they get messy fingers from the chocolate.<br /><br />Instead of the little pieces of chocolate and the loose granola, I think this would have been better and less messy as clusters.  By the end of the bag, it was so broken up it needed to be eaten with a spoon.<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly call this ""healthy"" just because of the nature of granola and chocolate, but it is refreshing not to have it filled with junk and preservatives.  Back to Nature products are generally reliable about that.  I think it alternate flavors, I might be more enamored with this product.",0
Great product but Amazon needs to ship it sealed and by itself.I ordered the coarse sea salt twice and both time something has happened to the shipment.First time one of the bags where broken and was leaking out of the box and the UPS driver said when he delivered whatever is in that box is now all over my truck and left a path from the truck to my door.So I ordered it a second time and was shipped with cleaning products and it leaked all over the whole shipment and this time I ask Amazon to replace it Amazon gladly replaced it and shipped replacement over night.,0
"In case you didn't read the title, this thing is tiny. Bought this for a stocking stuffer last Christmas for my niece who's a big fan of Super Mario Bros. It did get a great reception. But it cost $5 with shipping and thought it would be bigger. It is not 3x3x3 as the ad claims. The actual bomb body which holds the candy is probably 1 1/2"" diameter. Definitely not worth the price. Find it somewhere with no shipping cost.",0
"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA.",0
This price is ridiculously high!!  I can get this item through my natural food co-op for at least $15 less per case!  Don't buy this at this price....shop around!,0

"I bought a single Brussel's Money Tree a few months back and it arrived in good shape and I was happy with it. I ordered 2 more to give as gifts and they arrived crushed and close to being dead. Attention to detail in packing the delicate items was not there. I got a much larger, healthier, and less expensive plant at Lowe's Home Improvement. If you order one of these it is a toss of the dice. Good luck!",0
"I have been roasting my own coffee for quite a few years. However, due to blood pressure concerns, I decided to drink more decaffeinated coffee. I purchased this St. Ignatius coffee based on the two good reviews.<br /><br />True, I am new to decaffeinated coffee, and I have never roasted any decaffeinated beans. However, I was surprised at how utterly 'black' this St. Ignatius coffee is (it is also very finely ground).<br /><br />The color could be due to the decaffeinating process, I suppose, although I suspect it is some type of food coloring (one reason I started roasting my own coffee was due to the number of coffee manufacturers who add not only coloring to the ground beans to give it a better 'color', but also add 'fresh roasted scent' to the can, whic quickly evaporates after you open it the first time).<br /><br />The first day I filled up my thermos with this coffee, and subsequently washed it out upon returning home, I was amazed at how many times I had to rinse out the thermos to clean it out: something I never had to do with regular coffee, and which I suspect is due to coloring. The only way I could get coffee this color via roasting is to burn it. Of course, the St. Ignatius does not taste burned.<br /><br />The taste is 'ok'. It is not as 'strong' tasting as the black color of the grounds would suggest. I am now experimenting with mixing in some St. Ignatius coffee with my own coffee to lessen the amount of caffeine.<br /><br />At the grocery store I bought a decaf Community Coffee, which I think tastes better on its own, and is a more normal dark brown color.",0
"I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.",0
"Coffee drinkers tastes are wide and varied, like all coffee drinkers, I like my coffee a certain way, strong, black, with a touch a sweetness. This canned coffee drink is strong, black, but too sweet for me. I liked that it was more like coffee rather than a cream drink with some coffee mixed in, but the sweetness of it killed it for me. It wasn't terrible to the point of ""I can't drink this"" but it also wasn't so good that I would go out and buy it. I do love iced coffee though and I would consider buying an unsweetened version. I never let the coffee shop put the sweetener in my coffee, I want to do it myself to my taste and feel the same with a bottled or canned coffee such as this. I could tell there was a good expresso coffee flavor to this drink and would definitely like to try a plain version I could make to my own taste.",0
I ended up only being able to use a portion of these packets because they are so strong.  So strong that I exchanged them for something else.  I'll stick with Starbucks making my drinks for me.,0
"Tried this blend as a change from routine, but did not find it as enjoyable as I had hoped, still, it was good, just not great.<br />Pat",0
"It could be the sweetener that I might be allergic to it?, but after drinking this stuff, my mouth gets coated & I feel incredibly thirsty & dehydrated.<br /><br />Flavors are great (I HAD to try another flavot, the black cherry, to see if it was the flavoring - same result!)<br /><br />Has malic acid in it, and a few vitamins, yet can't read all the ingredients, so not sure if the problem is the dyes or the sweetener - could be either causing that severe thirst, which is why we want flavor/vitamin-enhanced water to begin with.<br /><br />I don't care that it's 0 calorie or not, but would LOVE to see these in the same form only with a sweetener & perhaps without the colors, that don't cause a reaction... This stuff should be labeled the ""diet"" version, as many of us have problems with diet sweeteners, OR, better yet, they could use something like ""EZ Sweets"", that most people don't react to adversely, unlike ""Nutrasweet"" & other zero-calorie drinks & drink mixes.<br /><br />If the color was gone or at the VERY least the sweetener changed, I'd give it 10 stars out of 5, if I could!<br /><br />This is a great idea for every day, to throw in your purse, car or whatever. The sweetener tastes OK, but either the sweetener or dyes cause extreme thirst, gas, and I don't feel well at all after drinking this stuff.<br /><br />Fun for college & HS students who seem to want to see who can drink it the strongest, or even right out of the bottle, which is VERY small & makes more servings than it says. Bottle says ""24 servings"", yet I think that's for large glasses (maybe 24oz or so?) The 1st time I tried it, I followed the directions & it was FAR too strong, so it only takes a little to go a LONG way!<br /><br />IF the sweetener (& possibly coloring) is changed & I don't get a bad reaction, and the taste is as good (I know the EZ Sweetz sweetener is fine), I'll be buying a LOT more of this stuff for the car, the house, my purse, overnight bags, traveling, etc.",0
THE SMELL WAS BETTER THAN THE TASTE. THE TASTE WAS GOOD BUT IF IT WOULD HAVE TASTED THE WAY IT SMELLED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.,0

"And it was pretty meh.  Priced at $1 per box at kroger, this week if you buy 10 you get $5 off so it would be $.50 a box.  I was hoping it would taste great! But the less then positive reviews were right, against the hype.  I do like that its natural and organic...but it needs way more cheese!  Although the shells that had a bit more cheese on them tasted good, the overall taste seemed like I added too much milk, even though I used far less than the recommended 1/4 cup.  I give it a meh rating.  I would also go so far as to say these should have a regular price of that $.50 as well, sad to say.  I am curious about the other varieties though...sure wish it had more cheese...",0

"another reviewer posted about worms and leaves....thankfully we did not experience the worms part but we did find a number of smaller dehydrated portions of the leaves in the bags, although this is not the end of the world it would be nice if they could do a little better job cleaning it out.<br /><br />On to the Berries, they have been quite a bit better than 2 other name brand types we have tried as well as the bulk types from the health food store.  The plastic bag seems to work better than the other brands that have used a metallic type bag which in turn gave the other brands of berries a metallic taste like I would imagine aluminum foil tasting.  The fact that these did not taste that way has kept them in our cupboard!",0
"This soup is very tasty, and the price on Amazon is excellent if you want to buy a few soups. I turned a couple of people on to this soup because it looks so good, the quality of the noodles is excellent. I stopped eating them because I wanted more for my calorie intake...but it is a good soup.",0
"This is fairly good, but the Timothy's version is better and costs a bit less.",0
"We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right.",0
"I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong/bold flavorful brews in the French and Italian.",0
"I purchased this thinking that all the flavors would be some version of hot chocolate; what I ended up with was two types of actual sweet chocolate: one hot chocolate, one white chocolate.  All the rest are flavored coffee blends.  I'm sure that folks who like chocolate-flavored coffee will enjoy this (friends at work who've tried some of the flavors like them), but I'm a dark-roast, no flavors, sugar or milk coffee lover, so this just wasn't for me.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for.  The ""limited edition print"" wasn't exactly the draw, either, but I appreciate the interest in putting in someone's art.",0
"it was melted on arrival but it is probably due to the hot weather of late.  it was wrapped in a space blanket and had cold packs inside with it but the alcohol still was gone only to be replaced by sugar particulates left behind as the alcohol evaporated away:(  since i cant have alcohol while deployed i was really looking forward to the tiny sips of it but my dreams were dashed.  ah well, order in the cold months, seems like it is pretty good quality shipping and chocolate bar.  i havent however received the other chocolate from this same company so i dont know what is going on with that...",0
"I was thrilled to learn that General Mills began offering gluten-free rice chex and corn Chex a while back.  And being a chocolate lover, when they also made Chocolate Chex gluten-free, I could not wait to try it.  It was quite a disappointment.  To me at least, the chocolate flavor seemed to be just that - flavor - not what actually tastes like real chocolate.  It's not awful, and I won't have a problem eating the whole case of 6 boxes, but it'll be just a bit at a time until all the boxes are gone.  I don't anticipate purchasing more of it.  I truly wanted this to be a 5-star product - it just isn't.",0
"This Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea (Blackberry Vanilla), is a bit too ""sour fruity"" for me, but I have to admit I went through a recent phase of drinking quite a bit of Turkish tea.  As with many teas, they can be an acquired taste.  I haven't acquired this one.<br /><br />As a product, however, the tea bags worked nicely in their ""Pyramid"" format, and I like that the tea bag seemed to drain better as I pulled it out compared to the traditional tea bag.<br /><br />Take a look at this product if you like fruity teas with no caffeine.",0
I've been giving these to my dog for the last 6 months and these are his favorite treats. However I thought these were not irradiated but it turns out they are. I think I will look into the all natural breast tenders even though they are more expensive. In the long run it's better for your dog.,0
I usually enjoy my coffee but the package was split and coffee grounds were in every cup of coffee making my mornings unhappy,0
"These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a ""sugar crash"". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.",0
"This hot chocolate is fairly good, however it is way too sweet for my taste.  Too much sugar taste and not enough chocolate.",0
"I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.",0
"After Emerald's disappointing cocoa-powder covered almonds, I expected these to be better. If anything, they're slightly worse.<br /><br />Pepper seems a complementary taste for cashews. But there's too much pepper, and way too much salt. They smother the cashew taste. Though the cashews are of good quality (off-brands can be Really Lousy), their texture isn't quite as crisp as I'd like. (Granted, cashews aren't particularly crisp to begin with.)<br /><br />The cannister is nice -- ergonomic and sturdy. I can see buying this product simply to get the cannister to hold plain nuts or other snacks. (Lead balls, too.)<br /><br />Most nuts are sold ""plain"", with only a bit of garnishment (salt or mild spices), and for a good reason -- nuts taste good by themselves. They don't need enhancement. If Diamond (the ""synomymous with walnuts"" company that makes Emerald products) is trying to enhance their profits by ""enhancing"" their products, they're not doing it very well. I'd rather have a can of Planter's, thank you.",0
"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",0

"I had read earlier reviews about the noodles smelling like fish. This made me wary to buy them, but I decided to be adventurous and got them anyway. When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jello and rubber combined. Once I got used to the texture, they were ok, but did not absorb much of the sause they were cooked in. I do not plan on buying these again, but may consider trying one of their flavored noodles.",0
I love Green Mountain and the delivery is very quick but this last batch had no flavor..guess I need a more robust coffee now...was disappointed this last time..Sorry..,0
"I bought these as a sweet treat for lunch boxes. Cliff is a favorite at our house, so I wasn't too concerned about quality. When I got these and read the ingredients, I was completely miffed that all 3 flavors have no other substance but apple. I will probably go back to buying the stretch island fruit because they actually include in the ingredients the fruit that is the flavor on the front label.",0
"I am glad it is organic, and it looks as though they have put a lot into making their packaging materials healthy and earth-friendly.<br /><br />The flavor is mild and the amount of caffeine is very low.  This is probably because there is very little green tea in this mixture.  The flavor mostly comes from the toasted brown rice.  This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.<br /><br />I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources.  The best tea would come from specialty importers, but that would be quite a bit more expensive.",0

"Ginger Nuts are like the Tomacco grown on the long-running ""Simpsons"" cartoon--they have a stingy bite at first, but become addictive upon subsequent tastings.  The ginger, along with the lemon flavoring, gives the cookies the taste that may put off all but the most discerning consumers.  Packages of Ginger Nuts can be bought in the International Foods section at the local Big Lots for two bucks or less--why buy online?",0
"I finished this wine kit about 4 weeks ago and like all other paklab products this creates a solid house wine to have around.  While I prefer their ""Vino Italiano Moscato"" kit-wine, this kit creates a very smooth, drinkable end result.<br /><br />There is a step during the creation process of these kits that requires you to ""top-up"" your carboy.  It's best to use the same kind of wine from a previous batch, however as this was the first time I made this wine the alternative was clean spring water.  I felt that I might've watered down this wine too much during this phase.  I have, however, used spring water at this point in several kits in the past and not had a watery taste at the beginning of one's sip.<br /><br />The goal, then, is to make another Pinot Grigio kit and use wine from the previous batch to avoid adding unnecessary water.  Of course by the time the second batch is made, rarely do I have excess wine to add to a kit.  This is due to the fact that these Paklab kits are SO drinkable, their end product seems to disappear so quickly.  The only reason I gave this wine a 3 instead of a 4 is because I prefer the Moscato from their Vino Italiano lines of kits, but that could be simply personal preference.",0

I made this 3 ounces (1 packet) to a full pot of water in my 12 cup drip coffeemaker, maybe that was the reason for the weakness.

"Overall, I am moderately satisfied with this product.  Ordering was easy (of course); it was delivered as promised; the reclosable bag is very nice; the flavor of the tea is fine.  My only problem is that the tea seems to have been ground.

"I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.",0
"i bought this thinking that it was a really good idea to keep the pup busy, but upon introducing it to my boston terrier, he was a bit hesitant about approaching the toy.  i think it's the spikey round opening of the container.  plus, he's not a ""puller"" so he hasn't quite figured out how to get the treats out.  it's been more frustrating than fun for him thus far.  all in all, a nice idea but not an intuitive toy for dogs.",0
Before opening this package I read the ingrediants and daily values. There was an advantage in the lack of saturated fats which was pleasing to me. I had the Olive flavored variety. I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past. Was pleasing enougha but I can't honestly say I would purchase again.,0

"I love this cocoa, but if you're counting calories be aware that the nutrition info on the label (which you can view near the top of the product page) is a fairy tale.<br /><br />A single serving (1 tablespoon, 5g) is listed as 10 calories yet contains 1g of fat, 2g of carbs, and 4g of protein (which comes to 7g and 33 calories, not 5g and 10 calories).  So something, somewhere has to give.<br /><br />I looked up this exact same product on the Saco site and they post different numbers (1g fat, 3g carb, 1g protein) which at least add up correctly on weight, but they don't include calorie information (which should be 25 calories if the nutrition information is accurate).<br /><br />As I consume vast quantities of this powder in a low-carb diet, understating the calories by a factor of three or more is not a minor issue.<br /><br />I'll keep using it, but with muted zeal.",0
"I recently had the pleasure of trying the Cinnamon flavored Outmeal Squares.  This is a tasy cereal out-of-the-box, and many people will just need to add milk to enjoy.  I am a sugar-holic, plus I love Cinnamon, so for me the product could have used a bit more sweet and cinnamon flavor.  But that is easily sprinkled on if desired.  Overall this is a decent cereal - give it shot!",0
"I was intrigued by the flavor of the coffee, but I just didn't care for it (didn't come through in the brewed product IMHO)  I think my blah report is more of a personal preference for Starbucks coffee more than anything else.",0
"The texture is great and I suppose if you like mango syrup you would like these too.  Taste exactly like it.  A little too sweet for my taste.  The chocolate covered black liquorice is one I usually get, and those are awesome. But they ran out so I decided to give the mango and green apple a try.",0
"I bought these cookies because I love lemon, I'm always looking for something that tastes good and is gluten-free. These cookies had everything up until the after taste - they had this funky fake lemon taste that wasn't there at the beginning. I was disappointed in the box and never bought another.",0
"I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.  It's just like a sort of bland peanut butter w/some unsugared cocoa powder thrown in.  The cocoa powder makes it drier and less oiler, which definite decreases the mouth-feel pleasure for me.  Seems like diet peanut butter w/choco added to make people feel less deprived.  I won't throw it out, but I went back and got Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter instead. I know it's like oranges and tangerines - not exactly the same, but I still think Justin's has a better concept for the heft and creaminess needed as well as a better level of salt. The search continues...",0
"First of all it is loosely packed. When I first used the product, water came out first before I could see any coffee and that is entirely on the packing. To me the chocolate like taste is not for me. It tempers with the way I like my coffee to taste. Bottom-line it is not  nearly as good as Starbucks. Had I rated this product the first week I tried it, I would have given it one star.  But now since it has been a while I am a little more forgiving. It is cheaper than most pods to begin with. Pressing on the pod helps the loose packing problem. Since I drink at least 3 cups a day, I have chosen to make one Starbucks and then do the rest with this to save some. But if you ask me to entirely switch to this product, I wouldn't even think about it. However I would suggest the before you get 150 pack, first try the lesser package. At first I felt trapped with 150 pods that I hated until I compromised and coped. If you're not looking to save, look away. But if you want to save, after a while it is not too bad.",0
"Part of thr reason I picked this product was we have an ant problem in our area. The picture shows a plastic, twist top container - ant proof. I ordered two. I received 2 cardboard drums with snap-on plastic tops. Our ants have learned to eat through these. My only option is to open both drums and repackage them. The product is the same but the packaging is a problem for me.",0
"The French vanilla flavoring was good, but I found the coffee itself to be very weak. I'll admit I am a usual Starbucks French roast drinker, so my pallet naturally gravitates toward stronger brews.",0
"These are great candy bars.  I purchased them in the store and then was not able to find them.  Was excited when I found them on Amazon.  The problem was very...very slow shipping and they seem stale.  The experation date is good, but they taste stale.  Am just disappointed that they are not the great candy bars I had from the store!",0
"All my dogs reacted badly to this food.  They seemed to like the taste but it gave them diarrhea.  I gave it a while but saw no improvement.  However, they are now on Castor & Pollux's Organix, and I've never had such a great experience with a food.  The ingredients are high quality and their stool is now perfect every time - much easier pick-up for me!  So Castor has good products, just this one didn't work for me.  Every dog is different though, so yours may have a different experience.",0
We tried every which way to make this coffee. It is frustrating that each coffee must have it's own system to work. I gave up but not to worry I passed the coffee on to my sister. She was so pleased with the gift. She used a French press and said it worked fine for her. It was a full bodied coffee and good for that early morning wake up.,0
"I have been having trouble finding these Murray Ginger Snaps cookies in stock at my local grocery store, so I decided to try and get them elsewhere. After an extensive search, I could only find them at Amazon. I figured that it was a no-brainer since just about everything I order from them comes through as advertised with no complaints by me. Not so here.<br /><br />I ordered 12 bags of cookies, and the price was good, and the delivery was fast, but the packaging for shipment was below average. When I used a box cutter to cut through the lid tape, the tape was attached to one of the bags of cookies, so I cut that bag open and the contents spilled into the shipping box. I lost a few of the cookies, and had a mess to clean up. As I opened a bag each in turn as I ate the cookies, every bag had large numbers of broken cookies. It was kind of like they had been crushed in shipping, but the bags had remained intact so the breakage could not be determined from a glance. The Murray bags are an opaque brown, so there is no way to see the interior contents without opening the bag. I was not happy with this, although I did not ask for them to be replaced, as they still were good otherwise. I am dissatisfied enough that I am definitely going to try not to order this way again.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that the Murray cookies are excellent, and of the four or five kinds I have tried, these are the best I have found. My criticism is of the boxing of the shipment and the apparent crushing of the packages at some point in the shipment/storage process prior to me getting them. Also, the breakage that I observed was not present when I bought them from the grocery store. 5 Stars for the cookies, 1 star for the packaging.",0
"My cat loves the salmon flavor of this wetfood, but apparently venison is not as yummy. For him. Never seen a cat leave wet food in the bowl before.",0
"I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.",0
"This was pretty tasty!! ... the first couple bites. Honestly, after about half the bar, it was difficult for me to finish. The taste was too overpowering after a while. I don't think I'll be purchasing again. :/",0
"I LOVE the product, BUT, because each packet has a different amount in it, I could not give it 5*. I wrote to the company, & they never replied. It's really a pain in the neck, not knowing how sweet my coffee will be, with each packet. I wish they made it in bulk, so I could use just the right amount each time,...........but, then the company wouldn't make ALL the $$$$$$they do on the small packets. :(",0
"This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.",0
"On 9/9/2011 I order the above product.  My daughter and I recently started the Atkins diet, heard wonderful things about it and decided to give it a try.  The first jar was wonderful!  Creamy, aromatic, flavorful...absolutely devine.  I opened the second jar at the beginning of this week and what a disappointment.  I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it.  Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.  I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees.<br /><br />I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service.  He is shipping me, for free, a replacement product as well as some additional free products.  I am also sending the remaining jar back to the company, at no cost to me, for additional research.",0
"Very heavy on cinnamon, and I'm quessing cardamon. I really can't pick apart what makes ""chai"", but I like chai, and this isn't it. Very strong cinnamon. I even mixed it 1 to 3 parts loose black tea, and still strong. Not too bad with juice. Maybe even resembles mulling spices.<br />It does make a nice potporri for large rooms.",0
"The taste of this popcorn is superb; however, the dark kernels do not fully pop for us.  We are using a hot air popper and are still trying to figure out if we are doing something wrong.  We have separated the popcorn into two batches; one that has the dark kernels removed and one with the dark kernels remaining.  Of the two, the fist batch without the dark kernels is superior, but we are still experimenting with the dark kernels.  We have not tried another brand or type of popcorn yet, but will do so in the future.",0
"The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it. She didn't do that with the other brands I've given her (IAMS, Hill's science diet, the goodlife recipe). She seems to really like this food and she hasn't thrown it up. I'm not a vet so I don't know how nutritionally sound this product is, but it lists a lot of organic ingredients and it has chicken as one of the first ingredients. I'll post pictures of the bag with that information. I know Newman's Own is a quality brand (I use their pasta sauces and salad dressing) so I imagine this product is high quality as well. It sure seems to be.<br /><br />Update 8-16-12: My cat does not seem to like it anymore after the first week. I mixed it with her old food and she picks around to avoid the Newman's Own pellets. I tried putting just Newman's Own in one dish and the other cat food in another. She won't eat the Newman's Own when it's separate either. I guess she prefers the cheaper cat food.",0
"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info.",0
"It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).",0
"Great price, easy ship and I love this brand. Just not a fan of this flavor. My cats just don't want to eat this. Maybe it's the pumpkin?",0
but not great (IMHO).  Not quite as strong / robust as I like my coffee.  I do like Tully's - French Roast in particular.  I have friends who like their coffee a little less robust so this will be good for their visits.,0
"Probably will not re-purchase - it's very ""thick"" and does not mix very well in yogurt which is what I use protein powder for. It's better if sweetened a little (I use sugar free maple syrup) and better if blended into a drink. Great ingredients though, hoping it will grow on me more as I use it.",0
"The formula is great.  Our babies like it, it's organic, and the can isn't lined with plastic, so there's less chance of it containing BPA.  Now, although the product is great, we've had problems with Amazon shipping it to us.  They put 8 cans in an oversize box without enough padding so they were moving around and banging into each other.  Of the 8 cans, 6 were dented.  Of the 6 dented cans 3 had opened, exposing the formula to air and spilling some out.  We've ordered this from another online retailer before and the packaging was great.  Four cans to a box and 2 boxes to a larger shipping box.  Amazon is a bit cheaper and they have the subscription service which makes it convenient, but that's only if you don't have to deal with several cans in each shipment being unusable.  If they can improve the shipping, we highly recommend this product, especially the subscription service.",0
"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",0
"I remember loving these cookies so I was super excited to get a box through Vine. I'm not sure how much the shipping packing from Amazon played into account in my disappointment or if it was all due to Nabisco. The box was pretty damaged when it got to me, dented in several places. When I opened the package, almost all of the cookies were in some state of falling apart- more so than you would expect from the damage the box showed, which is why I'm wondering if some of it came from the factory that way. May of the cookies were coming apart, the top half separated from the cookie bottom. Those that weren't in 2 pieces had the the cookie part crumbling.<br /><br />Despite their sad state, we managed to eat several cookies, holding them together when necessary. And I am sad to say that they were just ""OK"", not at all like the Mallomars I remembered from 10 or so years ago, which is probably the last time I had them. My husband agreed that they weren't quite the same. I thought the texture of the cookie was not good, it was very crumbly. The marshmallow was OK but the chocolate didn't taste all that good. Overall, they were just eh, not at all worth the calories, in my opinion. My kids will probably finish them off, though, as they seemed to enjoy them well enough.",0
"I really don't like the fact that they are made in china.<br />Even if its organic, I don't feel comfortable that it's from china so I probably wont get it anymore...",0
"I bought this as a supplement to dry Natural Balance kibble. Though a bit pricey,(I wouldn't spend this much for a good t-bone), I thought I could use it in small amounts, chopped up and mixed with the kibble to stretch it out. Sasha went through the mixture, separated it, left the kibble all over the kitchen floor devouring the meat leaving the kibble untouched. I want Sasha's primary food to be kibble because of her teeth. The mixture is counter productive. End of experiment.",0
"Our l6 year old cat liked this flavor at first.. Now she refuses to eat it. Of all the FF varieties, this seems to be particularly dry. She likes the other FFElegant Medleys very much.",0
"The cookies taste great; however, they have no nutritional information anywhere on the package. In fact, the cookies are only wrapped in thin, clear plastic sleeves. There was no individual packaging at all, just 24 thin plastic sleeves inside of one plain cardboard box with no additional packaging or labeling. I didn't know it was legal to send manufactured food products without nutritional information.",0
"I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.",0
"My dog LOVES this food.  I really like that it is organic, especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods.  I will continue to buy this brand in the store.  I would rate the product as a 5.<br /><br />The problem I had was with subscribe and save.  I started out buying at a very decent price.  After only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40%!!  No notice on the increase was sent to see if I still wanted it either.  I believe Amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase.  My other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one.  Subscription rating-- 1.",0
"I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.",0
"Maybe my family is too used to mass market pancake mix but this was just too ""au natural"" for us.  i knew the 10 grain mix would be more substantial and flavorful good or bad than Bisquick but these pancakes come out heavy and very dark and the combination of the flavor, appearance and texture was just too much for my city kids to take too.  we've found that Kodiak Cakes Frontier waffle mix is a lot more palatable and when paired with a better maple syrup the kids can't get enough.<br /><br />in the end if you really like heavy dark buckwheat cakes this might be for you, but if you want to get away from the standard bisquick/aunt jemima mix to something with excellent flavor and texture, go for the Kodiak Cakes.",0
"OK - the nut butter itself is awesome. No sugar, just nuts and some palm kernel oil. I travel a lot and have specific dietary needs so I was super excited about these. It's the only way I've been able to get nut butter past airport security - usually they confiscate if I take in a tupperware.<br />The con about this product is that a bunch of the nut butter never gets squeezed out so I have to slice them open and scrape out the good stuff. Love the brand but will probably stick to the jars in the future.",0
"This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds.",0
"I was browsing around for some new loose leaf tea to try out and when i saw this it sparked my interest and sounded REALLY good. When it arrived i was so excited i could smell the spices and orange even before i opened the box. I was really looking forward to the taste, I like orange and chai and i loved all the spices listed. However when i made the tea and gave it a try it seemed VERY bitter to me, I didnt really taste the spices which made me sad because i had been looking forward to it, instead it just had this bitterness and that was all that came through, no orange or spice. I added a couple spoons of sugar and alittle milk though, and that mellowed out the bitter and helped bring out the spices somewhat. So it wasnt a complete loss. I think it will continue to grow on me however, i just wished it tasted as great as it had smelled! it isnt bad though just not the best i have ever had. I will try to make another cup or two of it and maybe that will help also. Right now I am somewhere between it is ok and i like it. I would not say i loved it or that it was terrible. it's just different. The pricing was great I feel. I think I will try some other teas by davidson's. I do enjoy it with alittle milk and 2 spoons of sugar, maybe a little honey instead of sugar would be good as well? a nice tea but not as great as i first thought it would be.",0
Is this product Halal Certified? If not I can not buy it as a Muslim.It might be Kosher but that does not mean a thing to me.It has to be Halal.,0
"now i had the 15 oz can so i dont know if theres a difference in taste, it did not taste as good as i thought, the pasta felt soft, it semmed like it belonged in the Beefaroni chefboyardee, and it was a little bit runny but nothing too bad. i liked the way the cheese tasted.<br />so if you want mac and cheese, its better to boil a box of pasta and add one of those glass cans of cheese sauce. certain brands that make tomato sauce make cheese sauce",0
"The tea was fine ground, not full leaf with hibiscus and raspberry pieces.  I was disappointed because that is when you get the best flavor.  Otherwise it was okay.",0
"My dog seems to really like these. I'm sure they're not the healthiest dog treat out there, but hey we all splurge sometimes. For some reason he won't eat the KONG while we're away from home, at work. But once we're home and he's had his walk he usually goes and finds his KONG and carries it out to the mat at the front door to enjoy his treat! I sometimes add peanut butter to it or plain yogurt. He digs it, the only problem is my dog gives up too easy. If the Ziggie breaks off leaving half of it too far for him to reach it, he's over it. He'll just leave it there, leaving me to have to dig it out for him later.",0
"My dogs are very picky. This is the first canned dog food, except for expensive Little Caesar, that they'll eat. Still, they hold out for table food as long as they can! My worry is that Pedigree has only 6-7% protein. Recommendation is 27-28%. Notably, the can does not say ""nutritionally complete""!",0
my dogs lost interest in chewing in a short period of time.  now they just lay around on the floor untouched.,0
These were not as flavorful as the plain nut.  I was dissappointed as the old time red skins were so full of flavor.,0
"I have purchased these Energy Blasts before in my local bike shops, I like the product, but when I decided to order an entire box of them to try to save a little money, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I opened my first pack on a bike ride to find that they were all MELTED TOGETHER!!!!  When I returned home I felt of the other packages and they all seem to be the same way!!  I have ordered other products like the GU CHOMPS and they weren't melted together, so I was very disappointed on my ride to have to eat all my energy blast in one massive blob!!  I will not order these on line anymore.",0
After reading reviews on here I had high hopes for this product thinking that maybe it was like Swiss chocolate.  It's slightly less bitter than Hershey's but other than that I don't see much of a difference except in price.  I purchased three cans expecting a real treat.  I will continue to buy Hershey's for it is much cheaper and the difference is not worth the higher price.  I only pay about $5 for 8oz of Hershey chocolate.  Save your $$$.,0

"I ordered this 6-pack of rice in November.  It arrived with a ""best by"" date of January.  Even though I'm sure I could eat it after its ""best by"" date, it's still too soon in my opinion, considering that I'm buying in bulk.",0
"We had pancakes from this mix this AM.  Used eggwhites instead of whole eggs, because that's all we had.  Otherwise followed the package directions exactly.<br /><br />They were good.  They were a bit grainy but light and fluffy.  They browned nicely and cut well.  Mine had a tendency to fall apart when picked up with a fork, but not badly.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Bisquik Gluten Free for pancakes.<br /><br />If I couldn't get Bisquik GF, I wouldn't mind these at all.",0
"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.",0
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.,0
"Over the years, I've bought at least a couple of dozen of these (single jars) from my local Wal-Mart for about the same price as here.<br />Beware, once opened, they can get stale within a couple of months (maybe because the [useful & reusable] jars are not air tight).<br /><br />Update: Thanks to the comments and reviews here at Amazon, I've learned a little more about cottonseed oil from here: [...]<br />My review went from 4 stars to 3 stars. And I'm probably going to avoid these in the future.",0
The Taste of red tea in this monster is delicious!!! The only downfall about my order is that every single can I received was badly dented.  Some cans were so dented that it was impossible to drink out of the can. This was the second shipment i have ordered that arrived dented.  Im not aure if it is amazon or the delivery people ausing the damage but amazon should communicate with whoever packages the drink to ensure that they are packed more securely to avoid deliering damaged cans to customers who pay good money for the product.  I love all of the rehab flavors of monster and will buy them again.,0
"When I got my hands on these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, I thought that the concept was actually pretty good.  I had my doubts, though.  When I opened the container, there was a very, very light chocolate smell that was overwhelmed by the natural smell of the almonds.<br /><br />After trying a few of the almonds, I tasted only a slight hint of chocolate (especially in the aftertaste).  I tasted no salt whatsoever.  The almonds themselves had a rather bland taste to them.  Perhaps it was the mixing of the two flavors that negated both of them.  Mind you, there was nothing terrible about the taste.  It was just bland.<br /><br />The crunch factor was about the only redeeming quality of these almonds.  Dry roasting provided a very nice loud crunch.  The dark chocolate ""dust"" wasn't messy, but a tiny tad of it did get on my fingers.  It was easily washed off, however, and this really isn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />What has me fence-sitting, though, is the fact that when my wife came home later in the evening, she tried the almonds and fell in love with them.  I was fully prepared to give a two-star rating to these almonds until she gave them such glowing approval.  In the end, I guess that it all boils down to personal taste.  If you like very light and (at least to me) very bland chocolate and nutty tastes mixed together, get yourself some of these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.  However, if you're taste buds lean heavier towards the chocolate end of the spectrum, stick with Goobers.",0
"My initial reaction, after trying a few flavors, was 'bleh!' and a solid 2-stars. After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE"">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92"">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.",0
"I love smoked oysters, however these oysters are so huge there were just a few in the can.  Since they came in a case lot, it's likely the remaining product of unopened cans will be huge also.  Most people prefer smaller oysters because they are firmer/not as mushy.  I wouldn't buy them again, even though the price was extremely competitive.",0
"This is a review of the product Coke Zero, not this particular packaging option. In short, I wasn't impressed. Now I'll admit I'm a long time Diet Coke drinker, so I bring that bias to the table. But I found Coke Zero too sweet, with a sticky taste sort of like regular Coca-Cola. I know that taste has its fans, but if you're a Diet Coke regular you should know that this version of Coke is sweeter.",0
"This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.",0
"Allow me to give you some frame of reference on me:  I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian, or sufferer of Celiac Disease.  If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star.  But since I'm not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I'll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.<br /><br />The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn't have a chemistry degree can understand it.  That in itself is refreshing.  They've even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:<br /><br />YES!:  Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, Vegan<br /><br />NO!:  Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin'<br /><br />WOW!  5-STARS SO FAR!  Let's tear this thing open!<br /><br />At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that's been mashed with a rolling pin.  Mmmmm...  Maybe that's why it doesn't need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future.  Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.  I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone.  (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don't count the kids' outright rejection.)<br /><br />The first bite redeemed the bar.  It's tastier than I'd anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary.  I think I might like this.<br /><br />The second bite lost the other star instantly.  I felt like I almost broke a tooth on a rather large fruit pit.  Guess I should have paid closer attention to the disclaimer on the wrapper that states, ""May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.""  I found a stem in the other half of the bar.<br /><br />As good as this fruit bar may be for me, I don't think I should have to strain it prior to eating it.  I have enjoyed similarly nutritious bars in the past and not one thought of seeking a dentist.<br /><br />Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all), I'll probably do some more ""research"" (read: taste tests) on other healthy snack bars before buying a case.  I will, however, recommend this bar to a family member who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I've sampled.<br /><br />Just be careful and take small bites.",0
"My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts.",0
"Lab enjoys the toy--now. When the rope was attached to it, he couldn't get the treats out at all and we were using TINY treats. He destroyed the rope in a few minutes and now the treats fall out.",0
"Like many others, I don't actually have a pod coffee machine. I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6"">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor. So I would say that there's good coffee inside but maybe the delivery process needs work.<br /><br />If you're using a proper pod coffee maker, you're on your own. But if you're looking for something better than the office brew, the contents of the 67 cent pouch are great for using in other single cup setups. 4 stars for the coffee, but 1 star off since it sounds like my roundabout way of making a cup gets better results than the easy way the pod is supposed to provide for.",0

The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, ""Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical."".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.

"Here's what No Fear energy drink is: some kind of liquid, dyed some awful color, filled with sugar, caffeine, and a bunch of ""energizing"" chemicals ending with ""-ine"", packing 260 calories and a taste somewhere between an unripe strawberry and window cleaner. Does it give you ""energy""? Sure, just like anything else that contains 260 calories worth of sugar. Is it good for you? I doubt it. If you are a fan of Red Bull, Monster, and similar drinks, I suppose No Fear will be right up there with those. If you're trying to eat right, lose weight and not get strung out on a bunch of chemicals, an apple or maybe a cup of coffee will probably give you just as much of a pick me up, without all the unpronounceable additives. Three stars for doing what it says it does, but No Fear is not my cup of taurine.",0
"I am a big tea drinker and LOVE Ginger tea b/c it works great for stomach sickness, queasiness, and overall digestive health.  I like the flavor of this b/c it's got a strong lemon flavor and it also smells wonderful, however, the b/c it's in powder form it leaves a little bit of a weird after taste and kind of coating in your mouth.

So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.",0
The can itself is steel making it harder to open; careful when you  hit the end because it snaps and sprays oil. There are typically two sardines per can and plenty of oil.

"First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really ""everlasting"" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y"">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting.",0
"So I was pleased to see that the cereal arrived before it's intended ship date, however when I poured my first bowl this morning and went for my first bite, I was pretty upset. I let it soak in the milk for a few minutes and then went to grab a big clump for my first bite, when I went to bite into it, it was rock-solid. I mean a hammer couldn't break through this stuff. It turns out all the clumps are the exact same way, and that's my favorite part of the cereal. So I'm still eating it and just not eating the clumps because it still tastes good, I was just ultimately let down by this.",0
"I've had so much trouble finding apple jelly for  sauce recipes ( in this case a spiced ham sauce) that I was delighted to find one here on Amazon!

I'll have to keep looking.",0
"I pitted this against another leading brand of coconut water, but I'm not sure I would order it again. While there were undoubtedly some positive tasting qualities, likely owing to good practices and Thai sourced coconuts, these were considerably overshadowed by a metallic taste. I could only say I've known this taste before in... SpaghettiO's. Texture wise the pulp was also mushier, which has the benefit of a higher ratio of the rich, buttery bits, but I'm left wanting a hint of crunch somewhere. That's to be expected from young coconuts though, sought for their fruit rather than the mature nut. I favor a mix, which I at least believe I've found in two other brands. Another problem I found was these arrived in quite bad shape, the cans were variously dinged and punched in. The other guys' cans were too, except those were pressurized and so held up better. The real drawback for me was these practically require refrigeration. Now I'm well aware most people don't like room temperature coconut water, but I actually prefer it and regret to say I found Amy & Brian's too unpalatable to enjoy naturally.",0
"I'm not one of those people who consider granola as breakfast because it's often too sweet and sticky. This one could almost qualify because it's not overly sweet, and there aren't that many chocolate pieces. So it's like an oaty breakfast with chocolate chips.<br /><br />However,if you're wanting that super-sweet granola flavor often eaten as snacks or for energy on hikes, this probably will not give you the burst of energy and flavor you might want.<br /><br />I was debating between 3 or 4 stars, but I decided to go lower because I felt like the product was a compromise to be both healthy and sweet, but not exactly succeeding in either. I guess I'd rather go all healthy or all indulgent.",0

"On a scale of one to ten, Maxwell House being a one and Gevalia being a ten this coffee tastes somewhere around three or maybe four at best. It claims to be a gourmet coffee but it sure doesn't taste that way to me. As for the acid level of the coffee since I'm on meds for the acid reflux there's no way for me to tell if it works or not. It claims to have less then 50% of the acid levels of regular coffee. For me 50% wouldn't do it. It would have to be acid free.",0
"This item arrived with great speed.  The moss greens up after you add a bit of water and re-seal the bag.  I used mine on a couple of my bonsai trees and they look nice.

"The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than ""tea."" It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the ""Stix"" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix.",0
"If one is looking to purchase this bag of dog food (I received one to review), the price is a bit high for the size bag considering the filler present within the food. The description makes a big deal out of the main ingredient being beef, but this is quickly rendered unimportant when one sees that almost the entire remainder of the bag is filler...including food coloring....perhaps to make the product more palatable to the server instead of the eater?<br /><br />This food can also help contribute to gas...I'm presuming that is because of the two different types of soy filler that follow neck and neck behind beef as the primary ingredients.<br /><br />I would agree with other users that Chef Michael's is best left as a treat/reward food as it breaks up a diet and may even create in-fighting for the last scraps of food...even if your pups don't usually go in for that sort of thing.",0

"Before I used this product in a recipe, I read a lot of reviews here since there is not a lot on the bag. And from the negative reviews and complaints about hard noodles, what directions that are on the bag do not seem very helpful. So I went to the positive reviews and looked for guidance there.<br />My conclusion? Ignore the soaking instruction of one minute in room temp. water. Try hot or boiling water, for a couple of minutes, stirring to separate them. Then all was well.<br />I used them in a shrimp and vegetable soup and added them at the very end, cooking a little more until I felt they were done for my taste.<br /><br />That being said, I still had a couple of issues with these. The noodle are very, very, very thin. Thinner than I would like.<br />Also, the packaging, in a bag, does not provide adequate protection and a great deal of the noodle were broken to tiny, tiny pieces. Ok, for a soup I guess, but in say, a stir fry, no.<br />I looked at other brands in the store today and they all used a much stronger package to protect the very delicate noodles.<br />So not at all sure I would buy these again.",0

"I am reviewing this product for Amazon, I received it as a gift for that purpose. After examining the ingredients list I noticed this has an awful lot of sugar, the first ingredient is Water, then Cane Sugar, do not let that make you think of wow that is good sugar. Sugar is sugar. Yes sugar is sugar but it tastes good and yes it has calories but how many really? there are 80 cals per serving in this bottle. This product used real sugar and yes it is over processed but it tastes good. It aids in the flavor of this drink.<br /><br />As I opened this chilled drink I was mindful of the aroma. Grapefruit, that is what it was screaming to me but there was a more complex scent, passion fruit maybe? Yes indeed it is flavored with passion fruit and very nicely, I am drinking the second half of the bottle right now and I can tell you I love it.<br /><br />I just cannot seem to wrap my mind around the fact it has so much sugar, with that much sugar anything would taste this good. Ok so I am testing it, (right now as I write this review) it says it has 19 grams of sugar per serving.<br />Wait a minute, I just checked the label again, it is very hard to see letters since they are so small and the ingredients list is written in an obscure font and made a little hazy, to hide the fact is has 19 grams of sugar per serving? Hmm what is this, it is not one serving per bottle, it is 1.5 servings per bottle,why do they give you 1.5 servings are you going to share it with 1.5 people? So that means this entire bottle (only 11.5 oz.) has not just 19 grams of sugar but a hefty 27 plus grams of sugar.<br /><br />Do you know what 27 grams of sugar equates to in teaspoons?<br />Now this is not a scientific experiment by any means but I just used a very reliable scale and found that it takes 7 tsp. of sugar to come up with 27 grams of sugar and that is what is in this drink I just consumed. Wait let me reduce the stars on my rating to 3.....<br /><br />When I need a magnifying glass to see the ingredients list that makes me pause, and ask why? I guess we now know why, I never use more that about 3 tsp. sugar in any form per day I just used up my next few days.<br /><br />Let's see a cola drink has less sugar than this drink, why would I drink this, for a sugar high? not likely. I would give more comparisons but I do not used many processed foods to look on the labels.<br /><br />Diabetics stay away, this is not for you, in fact it is not for me, is this your kind of drink that you would want or better still, give to your children?<br /><br />The only thing right now that has anything going for it is the taste, so if you don't mind the 27 grams of sugar per bottle then be my guest you will enjoy it, it has a wonderful bright light flavor. Know that it also has a lot of pulp going through it, and according to the label it has natural flavors and not real fruit, so what is that stuff floating in it, it is not real fruit hmmm...<br /><br />The aftertaste is not so bad, I guess you can just cover that up by drinking another bottle of this sugar water.<br /><br />I am sorry folks but this review went down very fast, I am sorry I cannot recommend this drink due to it's over use of sweetener. In fact I will not be finishing it myself.",0

I figured if two that I received had the same problem I must not be the only one.  I read reviews and saw that others were saying take the machine apart and put the black belt back on. We did that and now it works like a champ. Whatever the cause of the issue they need better quality control.,0
"These are smaller than the average Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookie.  They are very soft and chewy, but not too chewy that your jaw tires before you can swallow!  I wouldn't say they're gooey, but they are ""mushier"" than a soft chocolate chip cookie.  They are VERY sweet.  Too sweet for me, and I am a major chocoholic with a sweet tooth!  They seem to have a lot of brown sugar in them as that's the most prominent taste.  The chocolate center isn't really fudgey either -- it's more like a Hershey's kiss in the center.  Kids will probably love these (my son likes them), but I'd never give them more than one or two in a day!  Honestly, I prefer the original Chips Ahoy over these and probably wouldn't reach for these again (unless my son asked me to buy them)",0
"The 8 oz nabisco original saltine cracker is much tastier, crisper and saltier.  The salt on these crackers is more coarse than that which is on the 16 oz box.<br /><br />The larger box has a much finer salt coating and the coating is not thorough.  They<br />are quite dull in comparison to the much smaller box, even though the price of larger box is better.",0
"Yamamotoyama's Unsweetened Iced Green Tea is unlike any green tea that I've tasted. This isn't a brewed tea, but a powder that is dissolved in cold (and preferably filtered) water. The resulting light taste and aroma is that of fresh tea leaves.",0
"I'm sad I'm writing this review, because I was so excited for this dog food! After the TotW recall I've struggled finding something grain-free and affordable for my 2 Pit Bulls, who have skin allergies and need a high quality diet.<br /><br />I wanted to like this dog good, but I cannot abide by this gas! In ALL MY YEARS of dog owning none of my dogs have EVER had gas this bad on ANY brand or quality of food! I keep searching the house for little 'surprises', it smells that bad. Not only is the smell unbearable, but this much gas is a sign of poor digestion, which means they're not getting all the nutrition they should out of this expensive food.<br /><br />3/5, I would only recommend this to a friend if they had a small dog (the kibbles are tiny, causing my 60lbers to wolf the food down, in-taking a lot of air.) and they wanted to live in a cloud of noxious gas all day long.",0
Healthy or energy jelly beans - taste fine but cannot tell if there is any energy benefit???  Expensive jelly beans - probably will not repurchase.,0
"I noticed nothing different about the flavor or lightness/heaviness of this water. It was water.  I tested the ph and it real only 8.4, which is still better than tap water, but they advertise 9,5.  I will say that my test may not have been wholly accurate, but because I had only one bottle, I couldn't check it against another bottle not run several tests to see what the consistent measurement will .",0

"i own two labs and a golden retriever and they all go nuts for this stuff (no pun intended). i, on the other hand, had have a couple issues with it. knead the tube all you want, this stuff still comes out too watery to stay inside the kong toy. i tried refrigerating it to thicken some and it got too stiff to come out of the tube. eventually i gave up the fight and resorted to cutting open the tube and using a butter knife to spread it inside the toy. meh, it still works for the dogs but i think in the future ill just buy a tub of peanut butter for them.",0
"I've been using this trail mix for most of the year.  I use it primarily for sustenance, and don't place a very high value on taste.  It works well for that.  I'm also the type of weird backpacker that eats trail mix with a spoon.  I do it to minimize contacting my food with my grubby hands.  I've found that the standard disposable plastic spoon fits perfectly.  Longer polycarbonate spoons & sporks may not fit.  The small size of the ingredients in this trail mix fits well in a spoon.  I've had trouble with larger nuts and fruits in other trail mixes falling off my spoon, which can be an awfully sad moment while on a long backpacking trip.  Sadly, while a spoon may fit perfectly, the quality of these recloseable bags is sometimes so bad that the zippers don't align and the bag cannot be reclosed.  Now I carry a spare ziploc bag in case of this problem.  At least the bags do a good job of staying closed if it can be closed.<br /><br />I was initially disappointed that this trail mix has sunflower seeds.  For some reason I didn't expect it.  Just before writing this review I looked at the description of this product, and it doesn't mention sunflower seeds.  That explains my surprise.  I feel that sunflower seeds greatly changes the overall flavor of trail mix, and the description should mention it.  I'd probably give this product another star if it didn't have sunflower seeds.<br /><br />Those that find the aesthetics of their trail mix to be important may be disappointed with this trail mix.  While the ingredients of some trail mixes look plump and shiny in their bags, this trail mix looks kind of beat up and old.  It doesn't change the taste or result in crushed product that I've noticed, but if I saw this on a store shelf, I'd probably skip it because of the way it looks.  I believe this impression is because the candy coating on the candy coated chocolate pieces is dull, and because there's a bit of trail mix crumbs stuck to the raisins...and those crumbs appear to be the ""skin"" from the sunflower seeds.<br /><br />While I said I don't value the taste of trail mix very highly, I will make some comparisons.  Costco's Kirtland Trail Mix tastes much better, partly because it doesn't have sunflower seeds, but also because it has higher value nuts.  On an especially long trip, I prefer a fruity trail mix because it's easier to consume a lot of it, plus it's almost like eating candy that's somewhat healthy...nevermind all the added sugar.  Again, Costco provides my favorite, that is, their Kirtland Fruit Nut Medley.  I also like Walmarts Tropical Trail Mix that comes in the 26 ounce bag, although sometimes their trail mix is a little stale.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for something to give you the energy needed to hike lots of miles, this is a good choice, but it's not the best choice if you really want to enjoy what you're eating.  And for what it's worth, I'm still receiving this trail mix via the subscribe & save program, and have no plans to stop unless I make a bulk order with another company.",0
i usually love spicy chips... but somehow don't find these appealing... next time i think i will try the plain ones first! these are light and crunchy...,0
"I love my flavored k-cups, but this one I am somewhat disappointed with. It does not have the hazelnut flavor I expected. Gloria Jean's other flavors I do enjoy very much, like the Butter Toffee. I just ordered the variety pack to try some of the other flavors. This one just was not one of my favorites.",0
"I love this rice!  It truly is ""tender and delicious"" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese-style brown rice, thus more polished than American-style brown rice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail-order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.",0
"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!",0
so bad there is no nutrition label described...how much is the sodium content per cracker? thanks.<br />only 3 starts because no ingredients listed. I will review later.,0
"For Folgers and this being a K-cup, it's not that bad for instant brew. But if you are looking for a bold cup of Vanilla coffee, this ain't it. It's mild in the coffee area and the flavor is like a mix of vanilla and butter toffee. While the taste is off a bit in the Vanilla area, it at least does not have that chemical taste of other vanilla k-cups I've tried.",0
"I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes.<br />I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes.<br />Long lasting they are not !<br /><br />Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while.

"This is a great mix of fruits with apples, pears and bananas. However, it contains 50% more sugar than other Gerber 2nd foods such as Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit and Gerber 2nd Foods Pear & Pineapple (10g of sugar instead of 15g per container)<br />I did not realize how sweet it is until I tasted the food.",0
"I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts.",0
"I am a big fan of Marshall Creek spices and love the fact that you can buy larger quantities of the ones you use regularly.  However, be forewarned about this Oriental Five Spice Powder.  Under normal circumstances, Five Spice Powder contains anise or fennel, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and ginger.  If you will read the ingredients closely, which I should have done, it contains cumin,coriander and orange peel along with ginger and cinnamon.  This produces a sort of Middle Eastern or Mexican flavor and does not give you a typical or even close Five Spice flavor.  The spice is fresh and I still trust Marshall Creek for spice purchases, but will not order the Oriental Five Spice from them again.  Check out the others for a truer flavor. You will be glad you did.",0

"I have purchased these snacks in smaller bags at stores but decided to buy a larger package through Amazon from Snack Factory. Fortunately I only purchased one bag. The Snack Factory simply shoved the bag into a larger box with no padding of any kind. Almost all of the chips were broken into tiny pieces when I opened the bag. I contacted Snack Factory, but they refused to provide any help, even though I paid ~ $6 for shipping. Buy them in the store -- not from Snack Factory!",0
"I consider Purina a reputable brand and my golden retriever really likes Purina Dog Chow, so this seemed like a healthy alternative. My dog ate the food and did end up finishing the bag, but I could tell she didn't love it. After mealtime, she would sometimes leave some of the food in her bowl, which usually doesn't happen. The food doesn't have a strong odor, either good or bad, so maybe that's why it wasn't overly appealing to my dog. I'm sure some dogs would love the food, but it wasn't a favorite for my large dog.",0

"Summary:<br />This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.<br /><br />Pros:  Bottle looks cool?<br />Cons:  Price, from concentrate.  Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic"" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.",0

"When I bought this 2 pack of Colavita 101 oz tins, I assumed I would be getting 100 EVO Italian oil, as is printed on the smaller 34 oz tins Amazon also sells.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16"">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>  I had bought the smaller size in my local supermarket, LOVED the peppery flavor, and thought, ""I'm diggin this oil so much, I'll save money and get the larger sizes from Amazon, and laugh every time I see the outrageous prices I would be shelling out at my local market"".  Wouldn't you know, the larger size is a BLEND--says it so on one of the sides.  A blend of Italian, Spanish and Greek olives.  Goodbye peppery flavor!  This oil is bland compared to the smaller Colavita.  A good oil, nonetheless, better for dressings than dipping---but nowhere near the character of Colavita's 34 ozzer",0
"After looking for new spicy nuts on amazon, I came across these peanuts. Having heard good things about the Williamsburg Peanut Shop, I figured it was worth a blind buy and see how things go. When you taste the nuts, you first get a salty initial flavor, then immediately the jalapeno kicks in giving it that spicy taste. Not being a big salt fan, I wish there was less so the jalapeno flavor dominated more.<br /><br />The quality of the nuts they select are excellent, so if you're good with salt and spice, this might be good for you.",0
"I liked the taste of this coffee but there was a problem with some of the K-cups of this brand.  Probably a half-a-dozen of this brand of K-cups did not work properly.  I would put the K-cup in the coffeemaker, close the lid on the Keurig, and press the button of the size cup I wanted to brew and it would brew about 3 Tablespoons of coffee and then stop.  Coffee grounds would be in the cup and I would open the Keurig and close the lid and try again and it just would not brew.  I tried another K-cup of this same brand and it did the same thing.  Finally I just put in a Timothy's brand K-cup and it worked just fine.  This kept happening using the Tully's K-cup- so far I've wasted six of them.  Some of them worked just fine.  It might have just been a fluke with this box of Tully's K-cups but I probably will not order this kind again.  The K-cups are too expensive to waste 1/4 of them.",0
"This Ravioli has a Parmesan flavor as opposed to a Ricotta flavor.  The cheese is an orangish color which freaked me out, but I think it's supposed to be like that (judging by a review of a similar product).  -My product was six months away from the sell by date.  Regardless I'm not a fan of the flavor so I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product.  If you do buy this product I would recommend cooking it, then letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight in sauce as to completely soften up the cheese.",0

"A packaged substitute for a s'more, the Mallomars have a very thin graham cookie, topped by a large marshmallow, and all drenched in chocolate.  They are alright for an occasional snack, but my children enjoyed these more than I did. My children actually altered the Mallomar to make it a little more scrumptious.  They placed the whole cookie on top of a graham cracker and said it tasted great that way!<br /><br />I'm all for stories, and I liked how they attempt to tell their story on the box--that Mallomars have been enjoyed in New York City for decades, and its most loyal fans reside there.  Now they're spreading across the nation.  Makes you think about what you're eating.",0
"Yes, these ""noodles"" DO have a fishy smell when opened. The texture is long and stringy and has the texture of some kind of eel, or ligament..... Not exactly appetizing. However, you can search around online and find how others who also did not like this product have learned how to rinse, sautee', and have made them taste a lot better. Rinsing is definitely key. And then cooking them with a few seasonings on med-low is also recommended. If you open the package and just dump them water and all into your recipe, you will NOT be happy.",0
"I love this product.  Best taste, texture and nutrition in an all natural bar.  I just started regular monthly shipment of 2 cases from Amazon.  First shipment arrived with the chocolate melted and it is a real pain to eat.  Amazon's fault not Kind's.  Even after putting them in the fridge to harden up the coating.  I receive my next shipment in a week and will let you know if shipping is a problem",0
"While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon.",0

"The others like it a lot and I think the taste is good, but the texture is just off to me. Its very soft and tender, but kind of crumbly. I prefer the honey pepper. Not too spicy, either, so that's nice. Over all its ok and the others in the office will buy more, but I will stick to the other kinds.",0
"I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on ""subscribe and save"" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck.

"it's really sweet. and it just wasn't anything like i expected. the color reminds me of wet cement and to me, that's just not appetizing. don't get me wrong, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. i still have 4 of the 6 pints left in my freezer from months ago. i won't buy it again though.",0
"I really enjoy my coffee, but usually do not like flavored coffees.  (I'm actually a bit of a snob with my coffee, getting fresh-roasted beans, using my french press, raising my nose at drip makers...  yet sometimes I do find the convenience of a single-serve Keurig cup irresistible, and not bad at all in a pinch).  The one exception to my ""no flavored coffees"" is SB's Pumpkin Spice Latte.  YUM.  So, I was tempted by this and tried it.<br /><br />It definitely smells better than it tastes.  The smell takes you right back to SB's Latte and sets your expectations high.  The taste, well, not so much.  It's that typical discourse between smell and taste that makes me not like flavored coffee to begin with.<br /><br />But the truth is I will likely come back and have one of these every now and again... it's just not as good as I was hoping.  The fact that a flavored coffee gets any respect from me at all should actually be considered a ""win"", so take that for what it's worth.  If you dig flavored coffee as a rule, I wouldn't be surprised if you loved this.  And even if you aren't usually a flavored coffee person, if you like the P.S. Latte, you may make an exception for this.",0
"I didn't seem to be producing enough milk for my son so I decided to try this tea based on a recommendation from a friend. It definitely has an acquired taste much like black licorice, which I don't particularly care for. However, it is bearable once you add a fair bit of honey. It's hard to say if the tea itself worked for me because in addition to the tea, I have been taking fenugreek capsules and pumping after each feeding. In all fairness though, I did notice my milk supply increase. Before this tea and the fenugreek I was only able to pump about a quarter of an ounce or a half ounce on a good day. After the tea and fenugreek, I noticed I was able to pump about two to two and half ounces per session. Not much but still better than before. If you can get past the taste or happen to like licorice, I'd say it's a decent product. Just be sure to add plenty of honey. If nothing else it's a nice tea to drink before bed.",0
"If you have never had pure cranberry juice, then you might find the Lakewood exceptional.  However, it is not nearly as good as  L&M.  Compared to L&M, the Lakewood tastes sort of watery and flavorless, as if Lakewood used a lower quality of cranberry in making their juice.  The L&M is alot crisper and full of good cranberry flavor. The L&M color is also nice and bright red, whereas the Lakewood is considerably more brown.  As far as I know, they are about the same price.",0
Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality.

"I was interested in trying this low-acid coffee, as I sometimes have difficulties with ""regular"" coffee. Brewed up a pot in my drip coffee maker, and gave it a try.<br /><br />It was OK -- decent flavor, comparable to my local grocer's ""upscale"" store brand. I tried a cup black, and a second cup like I usually drnk my coffee, with ""pink packet"" sweetener and a splash of creamer. I could tell it was low acid -- the negative effects I sometimes get didn't happen; not even a hint of stomach upset.<br /><br />But I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant the much higher cost.  I wanted to be wowed by it, and I wasn't.  Your mileage may vary, of course, as coffee is a rather personal taste.",0

"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",0
I love Simply Organic products but this chili power its the greatest. Its flavorful but not spicy at all. If you don't like spicy food this is the chili power for you.,0
"This product is certainly good for you, and doesn't really taste all that bad going down....but the after taste is awful. Somewhat like rinsing your mouth with rotted cardboard. It'll probably be OK in smoothie form with some fruit & yogurt, but all by itself in soy milk, I do not recommend it! It mixes OK, just a few grainy specks left. But the greenish color isn't appetizing. (again, add some fruit & yogurt, and I'm sure it'll be fine)",0

"This sauce is far better suited as critter repellant than food.  Have a problem witth raccoons going through your trash cans? Put some of this on the lid and you'll never see them again.  If they touch it and then touch their mouth or eyes, they'll panic and remember it.  I eat habanero hot sauce every day- no exageration, no lie.  My wife and I love hot food and can handle it hotter than most.  This stuff, however, is just ridiculous.  It really should come with a big, bold warning rather than being nestled unassumingly among the other hot sauces.  The taste is good but you can't have enough of it on anything to enjoy it.  All of the other hot sauces in the fridge get empty and replaced while Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce sits untouched week after week.  In my opinion, this isn't a food; it's a repellant like mace.",0
"It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.<br /><br />Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak.",0
I have tried all of the RICEWORKS chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un-opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips.

"Both my wife and I are big fans of Mini-Wheats. My wife loves the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZHO7JK"">Kellogg's Frosted Chocolate Mini Wheats Little Bites Cereal 16 oz</a> while I used to love the raisin filled mini wheats they made in the 90s.

I didn't taste any cinnamon at all and the icing on the mini-wheats doesn't taste like any cinnamon roll topping I've ever had. I've had ones from organic co-ops to Pillsbury DoughBoy encrusted ones. This just tasted...odd and unpleasant to me. After finishing a bowl, I realized that it tasted like my rabbit's hairball medicine smelled. molasses and malt. Sure enough, malt flavoring is the main ingredient in the icing. As such it was hard to want to take eat any more after the mental picture of me gulping down Laxatone developed. On the plus side, my rabbits REALLY wanted this cereal. It's pretty close to what they eat anyway.<br /><br />My wife liked the cereal however, She didn't think it tasted like cinnamon rolls, but she found the taste pleasing. As such the cereal was one for two in my household and so it gets a thumb's in the middle here. One last note though, each serving is 47 grams of carbs. That's pretty impressive.",0
"Not too much to add to the title. 3-stars cuz it works, no more cuz it's too smelly for my use. This seems like a product in search of a niche.

You can always clean off the scum.""<br /><br />This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off, but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So, no more showers with this for me! However, I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.<br /><br />Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a ""technical problem"" with the container. The lid is on the bottom and not easy to open when your hands are wet. Also, if you use it at the sink (like I do for my armpits), the stuff drips out when you open it - OK in the shower but not at the sink.",0
"I've been off coffee for a couple years now.  Entirely, so I figured trying this now I'd have a good sense of how close it is to what I miss.  It's not coffee, lets get that out of the way.  You won't be thinking WOW! but like me, you might be thinking, this will work.  I think the texture is very similar to what I recall and that's what sets it apart from herbal teas.  I suspect this is due in part to some of the oils that naturally occur in the ingredients, just like coffee has.  If you're into flavored coffees, this is even closer to those I think than just a straight up cup o' joe.  I am enjoying my first cup and hope to enjoy many more.",0
"My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and eat these chips frequently because they are much lower in fat than regular chips. One serving is equal to 2 Weight Watchers points (old point system). It seems that the local stores are always out of them so I ordered through Amazon, but was disappointed in the freshness date. All 15 bags had a freshness date of August 11, which was much too close to the date ordered. The ones I bought at the grocery store in June had a freshness date of October. Although we eat these almost daily, we won't be able to consume 15 bags by August 11, and did not want to be bothered with the hassle of returning them.",0

"I tried this coffee, even though it was significantly more expensive than the Green Mountain (organic, free trade) Sumatra that I have been using for some time. Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.<br /><br />If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.<br /><br />It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good.",0
"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.",0
"This tea  was way too strong for my palate, you might like it. I received it on time,<br />no issues with shipping and packaging but I mixed it with other teas to lessen the strong flavor and I finally ended up trowing away the unused portion, very strong smell, almost like perfumed.<br />If you are looking for a subtle taste, you might want to try something else.",0

"The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria.",0
"Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Pears and Mangos<br />So, I remember feeding this to my son and it taking some time to warm up to this flavor. Eventually he did like it, but it still was never his favorite. Now, my daughter has started trying new flavors and with a day of trying this broke out in a terrible rash and was sick to her stomach. Prior to this she had eaten Pears by themselves without any problems and so my conclusion is that she is allergic to Mangos. So, for the time being we are staying away from products with mangos in them, but may try this again in the future once she has had more exposure to other items.",0

"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.",0
"What made Emerald Honey Roast Nuts stand apart from the others was its sweet crunch, and ""I need some more"" finish.  Both seem to be greatly diminished in the latest shipment I tried.  Perhaps to be more like some competitors, they are now ""drier"" in taste and finish, and emphasize salt as much as sweet, unlike in the past.  I worry that Emerald has tried and succeeded in removing the ""Old Fashioned"" character of these peanuts, and left us with a generic snack too much like others.",0
"I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.",0

"I wanted to write this review in response to all the other product reviews placed on this item (since it was those reviews that brought me to purchase this tea).  At the time that I ordered this tea, I never tried Egyptian licorice tea.<br />Overall, the notes and spices of the tea are enjoyable.  I love Cinnamon and that is what this tea mainly taste like.  Egyptian tea is a very sweet tea.  But it is not a sweet like sugar sweetness.  It is a very powerful artificial sweetener sweetness.  The type of sweetness that leaves that terrible aftertaste in your mouth and on the back of your throat. It is so powerful, that neither myself or my girlfriend can enjoy it.<br /><br />Due to this sweetness, my attempts to give my remaining 5 boxes away to friends have failed.  I love Yogi tea though and I suggest that if you do not enjoy artificial sweeteners, to look at other Yogi teas.  Or just buy a single box at a local grocery store to find out for yourself if you like this tea before placing an order of 6 boxes.",0
"It wasn't until my It got ""backed up"" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the It or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my It frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.",0
"I shared this with a group of my coworkers. We all tried it and though we all thought it was okay taste and ease of use wise, none of us were really that sold on the taste. Either it became way too watery, or when it was strong it just did not taste very good.",0

What I received was the standard hexagonal, 200 count container sold all over amazon for a little lower price.

"Ok so let me start this out by saying I am an avid Costco Maple syrup eater...and getting this was an attempt at something new. I was excited to try it, but disappointed when I did. The flavor is veryyyyy light, almost unnoticeable. I was hoping for a more robust flavor, so I think I'm going to try the dark amber grade A version from Sugarworks. I'd have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the syrup wasn't really worth the price, but to each their own. Restating something I readin another review, the syrup isn't from one particular farm, it seemed like a blend from different farms from different states. Who knows, but I wouldn't say it's not worth buying, I'd recommend it to those who like the flavor of really light maple syrup.",0
"3 pounds seem like a lot when you think about ordering a bag of powder, but this stuff goes fast, one serving is around 12 tablespoons!<br /><br />The upside to this product is that it offers up a vegan-friendly and healthy means of obtaining a significant amount of your body's protein and fiber requirements.<br /><br />The downside to this product is that one serving of this stuff is fulfilled by 12 tablespoons, whoooeee!!<br /><br />According to the label, this 3 lb bag is good for 45 servings. The seller recommends you reserve 1 lb for immediate use in the fridge and to store the remaining 2 lbs in the freezer for rapidly approaching anticipated use. I'm still shopping for a vegan-friendly protein powder product that doesn't require me to dump half the whole bag into my shaker before coming through on it's promise of delivering 50 percent of my daily protein needs.",0
"This tea has a very grassy, vegetal taste and smell, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.",0
The drink wasn't bad tasting and I did not notice a smell. Gave me energy I am sure because of the caffeine. It doesn't have as much caffeine as some other products out there...some products do not even tell you how much caffeine is their product-At least they are attempting to disclose how much caffeine is in their drink_ that is what I like about it the caffeine is low...I will try it gain like the chews or powder...,0
"I have ordered many other types of coffee from GMC before and had no issues, however these k-cups were not as good as they usually are. There were grounds in most of the coffee after brewing, which is unusual for k-cups and a few of the cups were perforated in the box. I will order kcups again from this seller but I was a bit disappointed in this shipment.<br /><br />The flavor of this coffee was great!!!",0
"This is definitely an adult cookie, not too sweet, with the consistency of a graham cracker and about the same thickness. An English person might refer to such a cookie a *tea biscuit*.<br /><br />Each cookie contains dried cranberries (not nearly enough of them for me) and you'll definitely need something to dunk them in if you going to eat more than a couple, either coffee or milk.<br /><br />If you like the taste of home-made scones then you'd probably like these. I don't know that it's a great compliment but these cookies, unlike chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin cookies, *are* resistible. You can set a limit on how many you plan to eat and then lay the package aside. So that might be a left-handed inspiration for me to continue buying them.<br /><br />Three cookies (the serving size) yield 140 calories. There are about 30 cookies to a package.<br /><br />I'd buy them again for myself but they're not a cookie that I would serve to guests if I were trying to impress them.",0
"I very much wanted to like tofu shirataki noodles. Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it. Since this product is not available locally and has to be shipped from New York to Texas at a net cost of about $5 a package, I would be very unlikely to purchase it again.",0

"When it has came down to us coffee drinkers, we often try to find the best tasting cup to start off the morning, and even the best iced coffee drinks all the way around. For Illy, they have made good coffee drinks, but this one I was honestly skeptical of trying. Their Illy Issimo Cappuccino coffee drink isn't bad, but honestly not as thick or driven as other iced coffee drinks I have had in other places, like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. While it isn't bad, there really is much that makes it try and stand out from all the rest. Illy has had some good coffee drinks, but more should honestly have been done for their canned, ready to drink cappuccino.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+",0
this used to be an awesomely organic solution to healthy petfood with no fillers.... i have been informed that the company is soldout and is no longr as quality since it is mass produced. i would rate it about the same as iams or purina now.(we now use 'taste of the wild'- made with blueberries and buffalo to name a few),0
"Over time, my family has changed its opinion a bit about this polenta. It is an extremely fine grind, too fine for our taste. Bob's Red Mill polenta can be ready in ten minutes and doesn't strike us as pasty. The flavor of De la Estancia is excellent though. I have begun to use it instead of fine cornmeal in baked goods. For example, Martha Stewart has a wonderful,  simple recipe for a blackberry cornmeal cake.",0

"Someone recommended me Marmite as a healthy addition to morning meals. I read the reviews here at Amazon and I was very hesitant to order because there was a general consensus that it requires an 'adquired taste'. After months of debating I went ahead this week and ordered it.<br /><br />I did what many reviewers recommended and spread butter on a slice of bread first and then spread a micro thin layer of Marmite (the butter was supposed to mellow the strong flavor and help spread the thick marmite). I spread about a pea sized amount of marmite in one slice of bread and 3 peas sized amount in another slice.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the smell, it smelled like beef buillon. Like very strong beef stock. The first thing I could taste when I put it in my mouth was SOY SAUCE and SALT. The taste was a combination of beef stock with vinegar and soy sauce. Not very plesant. The vinegar part was very potent and I could feel the roof of my mouth feeling a bit raw (sort of like when you eat a lot fo sauerkraut or pickles and the roof of your motuh feels 'scraped'). I think the micro amount I had spread on the first slice was not enough for me to taste the secondary flavors and so I only got the kick of the strongest flavor, which was not very plesant and sort of bitter.<br /><br />The second slice was just as potent as the first one but I could appreciate underlying flavors. Did I mentioned this thing is salty? Oh, it is salty. At the very end of each bite there was a really good nutty aftertaste. Its very difficult to explain the combination of flavors, but it is definetly a strong meaty essence with equally strong seasonings.<br /><br />The 'adquired taste' I guess comes from that bitter soy sauce/vinegar salty kick that is hard to ignore if you are new to the spread. Even a tiny drop of marmite will fill your mouth with taste. But overall, I consider it to be an interesting (good) flavor. Great for a quick snack. The fact that is jam-packed with healthy stuff (Folic acid, B12 vitamin, Niacin...ect) makes it a keeper in my pantry. I think I will experiment eating it wih cheese or a slice of tomato like another reviewer adviced.",0

"I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do drink a lot of it and I have a definite idea of the type of coffee I like and what tastes good. So, based on my limited palate, I can say that there are some things I like about this coffee and some things I don't. This is a medium sort of brew that is neither too strong or too mild and this makes it easy to drink. It's also easy to drink because there is no bitterness or harshness. The downside of this coffee is that there isn't much flavor. It's a sort of bland coffee without much substance ""in the middle."" I can see this coffee being used in an office or during the day when the caffeine effect is more important than the flavor. The only downside to this is that it's a bit pricey for an everyday drink at an office.",0
"...then you'll like these Special K Granola bars. Same chewy consistency, same sweetness. The flavors of chocolate and peanut butter are in there, but not in a strong way (I'd have liked more peanut butter). While ""granola"" is a very generic term these days, I'd also have liked to have a bit more crunch in the mix. And there's a slightly powdery aftertaste (not particularly unpleasant) which seems common with protein-added snack bars.<br /><br />I found this tasty with coffee, but couldn't really give it higher than average marks as there's just nothing particularly exceptional going on here. But if you're looking for a low-ish calorie snack with decent fiber and protein, you could do worse than keeping a box of these in a desk drawer.",0
"Pros:<br />+Really tasty, especially if you have a little gravy mix on hand to thicken it.<br />+Long shelf life.<br />+Great time saver, goes great on just about anything.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Amount of beef. They really didn't hold back with the gravy in these. The beef still tastes great, but there isn't much of it.<br />-Quality of the beef. This one's a little biased, as I grew up on Libby's where the beef had a much more solid, wholesome bite to it and that's what I was expecting when I grabbed these.<br /><br />All in all, still a great meal when you're short on time and still want something that tastes good. If they upped the amount of beef in the cans and thickened the gravy a bit I'd love to come back and give this 5 stars.",0
"I have two cats who are snack-motivated (the third is not, so her vote is not included), and we tried both the Salmon and the Chicken Crunch n Clean. It's a bit on the pricey side, but as anyone who has ever tried to brush their cat's teeth will tell you, anything that can lend a hand in kitty dental hygiene can be worth it. The cats didn't seem to have a preference between Chicken and Salmon, both chased and gobbled the treats immediately. There's the problem, though: whether it's the size or texture of the treats, or just down to the individual cat, only one of the two cats (same size, generally same disposition) bothered to chew. The other just swallowed it whole. I don't mind giving the cats treats, but prefer other brands for their ""junk food"". In this case, only one of them was getting the possibility of a dental benefit.",0

"Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.

"The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee Vanilla Flavor tastes bitter to me. I believe it's because this is a darker roast than what I prefer. The first pot I made, I made like I would my normal every day coffee. It came out way too strong and way too bitter. The next pot I made I put in less coffee and it came out better, but still a little on the bitter side. I finally got so that I added 1/3 the amount of this coffee than I would my normal brand and it finally came out decent. Coffee is one of those things that is very individual to each person and their taste. What one person may not like, another might. If you like darker roasted coffee then this would be perfect for you. If you prefer a lighter roast, you may want to pass on this or do what I did and make it much weaker than you would your normal brand. The Vanilla flavor is ok, but I prefer another brand of Vanilla coffee (DD are the initials). Overall, not horrible, but not great and if given a choice between this and DD vanilla coffee I would pick DD. Again, this is just my personal preference and taste.",0

"Honestly these weren't bad but they weren't to die for.  First off there is no preparation instructions on the package(or the Udi website) which immediately I took away points for. I defrosted (take them out of the freezer and leave them out for 2-3 hours, I put them in the fridge the night before) then I put them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes. The texture looks like regular muffins but the sugar on the top is too much and went over to one side. The flavor is ok, but homemade ones taste better if you have a recipe you like. Overall I wasn't wowed by them and won't buy them again on the other hand the Udi Cinnamon Buns are really good.",0
"From what I can tell the only reason that these treats have the Greenies name is because they are made by the same company.

Neither of them like any one flavor more than the others.",0

"I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by ""everlasting"" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.",0
"Love this coffee. However, now that Amazon has substantially raised, by 25-30% the prices across the board and subscribe and save has been removed I have found, at least temporarily, a cheaper place to buy. If you have a Bed Bath and Beyond near and get the 20% off coupons you can buy three 18 box cartons and save about $5. Cost me with tax about $25 and I got 6 extra cups vs the 48 box offered here. Just a suggestion. There may be other places as well.<br /><br />I do enjoy buying from Amazon and hope, maybe after the holidays? that the prices will become competitive again.",0
"""Cherry Pie"" is certainly a misnomer, even to those not used to traditional sweetness. Yes, the first ingredient in (all) Larabars is dates, and here it's very evident. Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component.",0
"Hey guys! So I finally tried this tea after reading these positive reviews, I was so excited and knew that finally something would work for me and my little one. My son has a milk protein allergy, so there is no decent formula out there that is safe for him and plus I wanted to nurse him, obvious reasons, breast milk is the best nutrition compared to any formulas out there.  So, ever since I went back to work FULL time after 3 months off for maternity leave, my milk dropped significantly. It is sooooo frustrating.  I finished all my frozen stash and it is the worst feeling ever.  So then I started supplementing with some prescription Formula, which taste like crap.  Anyhow, so finally I got this tea in mail, and it is day 3 already, made no difference to my milk production.  I am so UNHAPPY!  Seriously, Like how long do I have to wait for it to work, I am drinking 4-5 tea cups a day.  Are there any other alternatives ladies?",0

"This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just ""ok"", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee.

"Typically aloe has got kind of a bitter edge to it. This product isn't bitter, but<br />it has an odd taste. However, I can see it being used in a smoothie, so you likely wouldn't taste it. Aloe has a lot of health benefits. So if you look at it as a<br />health product the taste may not be a deal breaker. But in general, the taste isn't bad, it's just odd and that is a deal breaker. I'd rather get my aloe some other way.",0
"You don't pick a product like this because you think it will taste great or be nutritious. You pick it because you need something quick, convenient, and long-lasting. I bought this Bowl Appetit because I wanted something that I could throw in the back of my cupboard and forget about until I'm out of real food. This does the trick, is really easy to prepare and tastes decent if not great.",0
crazy cups k cups sampler gave a good variety of samples of flavored coffees.  The only aspect I was not happy with was they gave me a french vanilla k cup for iced coffee.  my keurig does not do iced coffee.  I think it should have said that it may contain unusable k cups depending on your keurig machine,0
"I used to use Tassimo, and switched to Keurig when Starbucks went to Keurig (it's all family members drink).  Compared to other Starbucks blends, this one tastes less bitter, ""smoother"" perhaps.  I'll stop short of saying ""watery,"" but it isn't quite strong enough for my first cup.",0
"I got the wholesome white bread mix, and I like the taste of it.  The only problem I have is I can't get it to rise in my bread machine.  I turns out great but it is a mini loaf.  I tried mixing it is the machine, and mixing it by hand and cooking it in my machine and I get the same results.  I have not tried making it in the oven which is another option.",0
"Like many folks here, I, too, got a sample 4.5 pound bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I've always thought that dogs must get tired of the same old foods, and I try to mix up what we feed ours. So I have been adding a handful of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to augment their daily rations of Nutramax or Iams, and the dogs like this stuff. I cannot see any harm to offering some variety, especially when one considers that this species will happily snack on found foods such as road kill, sacks of fast food remnants, and whatever one leaves within reach on the counters when possible.<br /><br />I do think it is quite silly for Purina to blather on about crafting recipes and claim that they have the key to what dogs love to see, smell, or taste. The needless addition of food dyes to this food ticks me off, proving that Purina is pandering to people, not pooches.<br /><br />And the marketing hyperbole ""All thoughtfully prepared, so it can be thoughtfully served"" is nearly enough to send me into a fit of laughter as I thoughtfully grab a handful and throw in with the rest of the dogs' food before adding a bit of cheese, leftover chicken, or even pasta to the mix.<br /><br />I think this food is a good mixer, but I will not use it as the primary food for my dogs. Purina, get rid of some of the fillers and dyes, and I will give you another star in my rating. As is, this stuff is OK as a flavor enhancer, and I will likely buy a bag of it whenever I find it on sale.  (Hasn't the cost of dog food gotten totally out of hand recently? In part, I suspect, this gouging is because of the money spent devising silly descriptions for the foods such as Purina's efforts for this product.)",0

Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts.

Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!",0

"Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural - I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars.",0
"I tried this brand because of its packaging. I bought the 6 bottle pack because my preferred brand came in industrial size. The syrup is nothing special and I would not consider it dark chocolate. Hershey's tastes more chocolatey than this does. I like that it is made with real sugar vs. HFCS. I won't be buying it again, but I will use the bottles to repackage my industrial size choice.",0
"It is difficult to find decaffeinated white teas, so I don't have too much to compare it with, but it does have a nice taste.  I might prefer a tea with less vanilla in it.  This tea is for someone that really likes vanilla, the vanilla flavor is very apparent.",0
"It's OK.  I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting this to be a 4 or 5 star rating, but I'm giving this a 3.  The taste is too mild for me.  There's no bitterness or acidic flavor, but I drink it with milk and sugar.",0
"I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, Green Mountain Hazelnut and French Vanilla were the first two  packs of K-cups we bought.  We were disappinted with both.  The flavoring is good, but the coffee itself is weak, even with the coffeemaker set lower.  Recommend you buy Coffee People Jet Fuel and some flavored creamer instead.",0
"Ive tried the Black Cherry version of this drink, and I prefer that to this. Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit-flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non-carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though - there's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy - unless you like bitter fruit - not sour - bitter. Maybe it's too much carbonation for my taste. If you've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new - think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I won't order it again.",0
"So according to Essentia's website, ""Most bottled waters offer purity but not additional benefits. With Essentia, you get added electrolytes as well as a much higher pH level, providing superior hydration.""<br /><br />I looked up the additional ingredients and found that it's pretty much filtered water with scant amounts of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) included.  In fact, each of the other additives (dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfat, and calcium chloride) are pretty much added salts.  Factoring that in with the 0s across the board for calories, sodium, carbohydrates, proteins, etc, you're really getting water with ridiculously scant amounts of mineral in it.  Will it make a huge difference in your life, such as giving you a better night sleep or amazingly clear skin?  Probably not - the placebo effect of you believing that you feel better will, though.  When it comes down to it, you can be chugging all this 9.5 ph water, but it won't matter much once you eat something...the acidity or the alkalinity will change immediately once you eat.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, the water actually tastes like the bottle water I chugged in China.  That said, it tastes like water, but with a metallic tinge to it.  It's not bad, but it's something I personally don't like tasting in my water.  If I had to say a water tasted ""silky smooth"", I would immediately turn to Voss water, but that's just me.<br /><br />All in all, it's still water, and if offered it, I would drink it.  But I do ding some stars for taste, hype, and cost.  It's probably cheaper to buy a reverse osmosis distiller over time - at least you can filter enough water the entire family!",0
"I think that this chili is an aquired taste. The first time was ugh, gonna have to throw these away. The second time eating it was better. I think this could be a really good product if they dropped the sugar content down. The spicyness is a good warm feel. but not take your breathe away hot by any means. It was also a little thinner than I had hoped for, I tend to like my chili thicker so it stays piled up on a spoon. Overall the taste of the spices were pretty good, except for the sugar of course.",0
"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.",0
"While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.",0
I tried this at refrigerator temperature but it might taste better if it sits in the freezer for a short time before drinking. It was passable but nothing outstanding that grabbed my taste buds. Starbucks drinks are better especially the bottled Frappaccinos so that is why this seems mediocre in comparison. I gave the rest to my teenager and she didn't even finish it.  It might taste better on a super hot day if you are craving iced coffee but no guarantees.,0
"This is promoted as a whole grain snack, so I guess one can make some allowance for the whole-graininess of the taste, however, I found this fig and honey combination to be just okay in terms of taste. I liked the taste of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA"">Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a> better.<br /><br />Just like the blueberry, each cookie is 47 calories, so it is a good snack if a small number of these are consumed. Unlike the blueberry, opening the package did not have a distinct smell of fruit. But the nutritional content is similar to the blueberry, with 3 cookies recommended as a serving (140 calories).<br /><br />There are 30 cookies per package, in two rows of 10, in a plastic tray. The package is sealed, and opening it reveals the ready-to-eat cookies. No extra packaging material to fight through.<br /><br />My personal recommendation is for the blueberry instead of the fig and honey.",0
"I bought a pound of Jelly Bellies from a local Wegmans's grocery, half Toasted Marshmallow and half Buttered Popcorn.  My daughters and I had some of them when we left the store and both flavors tasted fine.  I left them in my car in the Va heat for a couple of days, figuring the worst that would happen is that they'd get soft.  But while the Toasted Marshmallow were fine, the Buttered Popcorn ones tasted awful, and I had to throw the whole bag out. Something happened to the flavoring in the heat, I conclude... which leads me to believe that other reviewers got the real thing but that they were exposed to heat in transport.  In any case, it's a crapshoot, esp. in summer months, to order this flavor for delivery.  3 stars because the jelly beans are great, but you can't count on them arriving that way.",0
This tea has a good price/bag but for some reason doesn't have a great or even very strong flavor.,0
"I just tried the Planters Big Nut Bar.  It does have a very nutty flavor, as you would expect.  It didn't taste stale to me, just not like nuts fresh out of the shell.  The bar was very chewy and there is some crisp rice in it to add to the crunch.  It says the bar is 30% bigger than the leading nut and granola bar, but since I don't know which one that would be, I have to say I don't think these are particularly large.  I'm glad they aren't any bigger because each one is 220 calories.<br /><br />I like nuts and do like the taste of these, but I think I will probably stick to my plain almonds.",0
"The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.  Another reviewer mentioned it, but I thought that I would try it myself because I enjoy trying new things.  Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good.",0
The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.,0
"The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.",0
"A great idea and I would recommend it.  However, it would be nice if the cigars were a little bigger and more cigar shaped.  Overall though good idea and good product.",0
"I just bought his item off Amazon. The shipment came very fast, but some of the cans were dented. They packed it very poorly, they literally jut put it in a cardboard box along with a case of another canned food item. There was nothing but a couple of those air-filled bags in there with the 2 cases. They both got banged around pretty good before delivery. Both cases had several dented cans from the shipping, so a very bad score from Amazon for packaging by people that don't care.<br /><br />As for the CBH itself, I personally found the low-fat version too low in fat! It didn't render any fat when I cooked it in a non-stick frying pan. I had to add oil to keep it from sticking which defeats the purpose of the non-fat feature. Even so, it still came out pretty dry tasting, it didn't have that rich smooth taste that a little more fat will provide. Even without the normal amount of fat, this product still tasted fine.<br /><br />I can't really say this is a complaint about the product. After all, I knowingly ordered a low-fat version of the product to try it out and put in the disaster prep stockpile. I just want to let people know that this is a good product, but it will not cook or taste like regular CBH will. It is dryer and less flavorful. But, it does have less fat and if that is important to you, then this should fit the bill.<br /><br />I am knocking off 1 star for the truly awful packing\shipping.<br /><br />-Mike",0
"When I first ordered Switch, I was looking forward to something that was light, refreshing and tasted like black cherry.  Perhaps I am use to the taste of black cherry soda?  I am not sure about that, but I am sure that it didn't taste like black cherry.  It was just ""okay"".  I wasn't thrilled about the product, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to tell people that I don't like it.  Bottom line, I would not order it again, but I would try another flavor. The idea is there!  I'm curious to see if the flavor is!",0
Well here goes--yes it was good to find this creamer on amazon BUT instead of coming in the dispenser box they came fired in a shipping box. One or more them had leaked which made kind of a mess.  It would have been nice if these little containers were in a dispenser box INSTEAD  of being fired in a shipping box.  I hate with a passion cleaning up sticky things. At least only a couple of them leaked but that is still unacceptable.,0
"I'm a total chai tea freak, so when I see a chai tea that I haven't tried yet I pick it up.<br /><br />Twinings isn't bad at all, but there's just not enough ""chai"" in the tea.  It's basically a black tea with the barest hint of chai spice.",0
"The product was delicious.  However, we sent it as a gift and there was no way to put a gift card because it didn't actually come from Amazon.  I won't order again without a way to attach gift card.",0
Have to give it 3 stars as I thought it wasn't bad but my husband hated the after taste. It does have a little bit of an after taste but I didn't think it was too bad. My husband disagreed. So if you want something different than plain water or soda give this a try.,0
"I like the concept this box is going for, but it isn't effective. The sifter does a great job with poop clumps but wet clumps just stay stuck. Even with vigorous shaking sometimes the holes stayed plugged with wet, clumped litter. And if you have a large, wet clump stuck to the side, forget about easy removal! You still need a scoop to make this box work. I stopped using the sifter pretty quick and eventually just tossed it. I do LOVE having two bottom halves. Every three months or so I clean out the box and let it soak in a bleach/water mix for a few hours. Then I pop the clean half on the bottom and swap out when needed. It makes keeps the box clean and sanitary much easier not having to wash it right away and worry about an accident in-between. If you are a 1 box household like me that feature may be helpful but not for the listed price. I bought this box in a store for about $20. It has held up really well and is about 3 years old. The clasps are in great shape and the handle is still sturdy. I can fasten the lid and carry a fully loaded box outside for easy clean up without worrying about anything breaking. I don't use the swing panel door though, my cat never could get used to it. Overall this has been a good litter box and is very sturdy, but don't but it thinking the sifter will be of any help. If anything it took me MORE time to clean the box out than scooping by hand. I do love having the 2nd bottom half and it has held up amazingly, hence the 3 stars.",0
"The price was excellent & I heard many good things about the Kind bars... but the mango macadamia bar didn't taste all that great. I would be willing to try other flavors, but I would not buy this flavor again.",0
"The concept of this product is wonderful, since you can use as much or as little as you want.  I typically use the individual size packets of Crystal Light, which recommend using a standard sized bottle of water to mix it with.  With the MIO product, I can choose to make a smaller or larger amount.<br /><br />However, I really do not like the taste of this.  There is an odd tasting artificial peach flavor that I just do not like.",0
"I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.<br /><br />I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother.",0
"The coffee's OK, but the little pod gets stuck up in the machine. It's not impossible to get out, but takes effort and patience - I bought these as a gift for my brother who LOVES coffee, and his Keurig machine, but definitely doesn't have the patience to work with the stuck pod - too bad, too, because I really loved the idea of putting a lot less plastic into the landfills!",0
"I like ginger in certain situations, but I'm not sure this is one of them.  That's why I gave this 3 stars - I don't know if I like it, but I'm pretty sure I don't hate it.  I tried this hot, and it was soothing, but the ginger/honey/lemon flavor is odd to me.  Not bad, just odd.  And not odd like salt & vinegar chips that end up being addictive - just take it or leave it odd.<br /><br />If you like ginger & lemon tea, you'll probably like this.  But if you're not a big fan of either, maybe getting a package of six boxes at once is not the best idea.",0
"This is great coffee.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I seem to love a light roast that feels ""thick"", and doesn't have a bitter aftertaste.  Millstone is the best I have found.  It's smooth and doesn't feel watery.  What I don't understand is how it can sell for over a dollar a cup.  That's twice the price at a local store, and there are so many kcups at this price on this site.  Are there that many fools and lazy folks out there to keep this ripoff going?  Local stores sell for 55 cents a cup before tax and coupons.  Maybe this fits people in remote locations, but it sure is expensive.  They must make more off you folks than if they sold more cups at a lower price.",0
They were ok but I was not impressed by them.  The cost is too high and is not worth it for this product.,0

"After reading the reviews here about made in China, I was pleased to find that they must have been mistaken, ..... that the product is clearly labeled, Made In USA.<br /><br />The product is fun for the dog, I have a 3 lb chihuahua, and he loves them.  They are varying sizes, I'm sure ANY size dog could enjoy them.  My worry is that they are VERY pointy - sharp as a knife.  I watch him very carefully.  I have also filed down some of the points with a commercial metal file.  That was an easier option for me than returning, no matter how easy Amazon returns are, I hate to have to return things.<br /><br />I see other Smokehouse products that I can try instead, so all in all I'm happy with the Manufacturer and the product quality.<br /><br />So, while I give the product 5 stars for flavor and appeal, being made in USA, quality fresh when received - I have to deduct 2 stars for having to file down points.<br /><br />For those that want a list of dog-treat/food Companies that are certified MADE IN USA, check this website: [...] and then find the area that is dog-made-in-the-usa.  On the left, they have two brand lists, the top list is for the USA page, refine by company, etc.  Click see more to see the entire list - - the ones they carry that are NOT made in the USA are grayed out.  NOT made in USA, those include Beefeaters and Busybuddy!!!!  - much to my surprise.  I could have sworn Beefeaters said it had it's facilities FDA and HACCP certified on their About Us on their website.  That would say to me that they are USA, but no where on their site does it actually state Made in USA, so hmmmm.  Guess it's good to investigate.",0
"I was a huge fan of GFIC's Italian Cappuccino and was really unhappy when they quit making it, so when I saw this, same maker, same name, I thought I was getting the same product. Completely wrong. This item has a similar texture to their Swiss Mocha (liquid is somewhat thickened), and the flavor is totally different (again, more like Swiss Mocha). Would have been nice to know that it's a vending machine pack. Doesn't mix as well by hand.",0
"Based on the reviews, you take your chances when ordering.  I decided to try it. I got about 7 different flavors - nothing terribly exotic but I did learn I really like blueberry coffee which I never would have ordered on my own!  So I may order again - it's kinda fun to see what you get.  Does come in just a brown paper bag (like a large lunch bag) but I didn't care about that. It would be nice if they tried harder to get more of a mix of flavors.  The cups were still about $.75 each so it's not like they are so reduced in price, that you should be happy to get any assortment (and they do save on the packaging).",0
"Just tasted like coffee, nothing special. I have never had Kona and thought it would be incredible since Kona is so expensive.",0
"I drink coffee every morning and am used to a strong flavor with a bit of milk or cream.  illy's Cappuccino cold coffee beverage is a pleasant and convenient alternative, although I found the taste weak and a little too sweet.  Compared to other drinks of this type, it's not as sweet nor does it appear to have as many thickeners and so it's pleasant to drink but I've yet to find a canned coffee that is excellent, this one included.  As for the coffee flavor itself, it's a warm, toasted flavor that avoids the overly roasted, burnt flavor of the industry leader -- I just wish the coffee flavor were much stronger.  If I were unable to make coffee and really needed a pick-me-up, I might drink this beverage but only in such a circumstance.",0
"I bought this tea thinking it was the normal Acai Mango flavor, especially since the picture shows it. But in fact read the title carefully, this is the Ice version of the flavor! I now have 6 boxes of the wrong flavor.  I'd rate this 4 or 5 stars since it's tasty tea, but I prefer the original flavor. Minus two stars for false advertising.",0
"The 6-count of tubes of 30 is misleading here on Amazon. It says it's 55 cents per piece at $16.51 for 30 pieces. On the seller's site, it explains that it's for six tubes, or 180 pieces for $16.51, which makes it 9 cents per piece. Amazon needs to fix that listing.<br /><br />The single 30-count tube is twice as much as other suppliers (tho this has free super saver shipping), and the blister packs are a better price, and still small enough to carry around.  I only wanted one tube, to refill later on.",0
"Yep, they're crunchy!  I thought I'd lose a tooth<br />or two just trying to eat them.  They are very<br />thin and not easy to eat.

"I happen to love the smell of this on me, though it reacts badly with some others' body chemistry, as is to be expected with most scented things.<br />I've found that the ""dry"" line from Axe isn't the greatest. The deodorants are flaky on the skin, and don't do their job for very long - for me it's maybe a few hours, though might get up to 6-8 hours if I'm not too hot that day. I recommend going with the ""fresh"" line instead.",0
"Very runny on top, thick at the bottom which is OK with me as I use the top to make a salad dressing with Sriracha chili sauce, soy sauce and lemon juice. Taste is very mild, I prefer the bitterness of tahini. We have a middle eastern grocery store an hour away which has THE best tahini, this saves me the drive though..",0
"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.",0

"The good thing about Pop Secret kettle corn is that when I use the popcorn button on the microwave, every single kernel pops without burning.<br /><br />Pop Secret kettle corn doesn't taste all that bad; but it has texture that's a little bit leaning toward carboard and I don't think they've captured the distinctive kettle corn flavor.  It's also very greasy.  I don't think of kettle corn as greasy.  The ones at the county fair certainly are not.<br /><br />The best microwavable kettle corn is the one the Boy Scouts used to sell.  If only that company would bring it back.  I'm still searching for a replacement.",0

"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CEABE"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag</a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank.",0

"In my mind, coffee should be strong, bold, and well balanced.  Not so much a slap in the face, but more a strong limb to grasp (I guess I'm feeling poetic).  If you feel the same way, you may be a little disappointed with Dark Magic.  While it comes close, it has a slight acidic after taste which I'm not fond of.  In other words, it doesn't meet my criteria for ""well balanced"".  I hope that helps.",0
"if you haven't figured it out yet, Crunchy is the most distinguishing feature of these Os, for me it's beyond what I enjoy as a bfast cereal. The taste is fine, and they're not HARD in a hurt-teeth way (so not corn-nuts), but they'll ring yer ears.  We're gradually finishing off our box by mixing it into trail mix (perfect fit with nuts) or just as a dry snack.",0
"Does not quite live up to the name. Perhaps knee bumping or toe stubbing.  Kernels popped big with very few duds. Expecting a good bite to this popcorn, but basically got just the BBQ taste.

Now they're asking $21 for it with S&S!?  I understand there is some inflation in food prices lately, but a 62% increase??  For some dried pasta shells and a packet of cheese powder, gimme a break.  Out of control!!!  For this reason I'm knocking my 5* review down to 3* and I've placed my last order for this stuff.  It was fun while it lasted, Annie!  Pigs get slaughtered.",0

"We're a 2-3 cup a day coffee household.  This doesn't include all of the weekly trips to the coffee shop while at work for more specialized drinks.  Most of our home coffee is whole bean Colombian which we grind in a Krups espresso machine and coffee maker.  We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Organic and Fair Trade.<br /><br />+ Pleasant aromatic smell.<br /><br />+ Works great in a French Press.<br /><br />+ Great for travel.<br /><br />+ Appealing packaging and good overall message.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Tastes more like coffee flavored water than real coffee.<br /><br />- No instructions on or in the box on how to brew properly.<br /><br />- Improvisation may be necessary if you don't have a pod brewer.  We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the clean, sparky taste of No Fear.  It was clean and did not leave much aftertaste.  That, however, is the best part and the super energy part is unavailable for me to define and address with specificity.  On consecutive days I split the 16 oz can into two drinks just before going out for my test period which lasted about 4 hours each.  I was careful to isolate my physical, emotional and mental health for the several days preceding my test period.<br /><br />(Please keep in mind that those items are purely subjective and so are my feelings about No Fear.  Sadly, it is close to impossible to accomplish and objective comparisons with one can of supplement.  Even though the promo suggests that there are 12 cans in the study I only received one.)<br /><br />The high amount of caffeine did not add any detectable energy.  My coffee intake prior to leaving is usually about the same as in No Fear.  Thirty three grams of sugar in a serving (8 oz) should produce a significant increase in energy but I did not notice any.  None of the normal aches and pains reflected any improvements.<br /><br />In short, a great tasting drink with questionable and unproven claims just does not justify the cost per serving.",0
"OK, the description is accurate but I expected some brine.  The olives (and other ingredients) are shipped without any brine which makes long-term storage a challenge.  I had to make my own brine since if you leave the olives without any brine they get even mushier and spoil.  I re-packaged them in a plastic container and made a brine of sea salt and water (which is a standard olive brine) and they are storing well after 6 months.  Yes, I made them even saltier but at least they will last indefinately this way.  Make sure to use enough sea salt or they will spoil.  These olives are mushy and don't compare to quality store brands like California Olive Company.",0
"This WAS a great product. It was great tasting and it had a crazy low amount of carbs compared to most anything else out there. For people who need to manage their carb intake, this was a real treat and there wasn't much else out there that compared. There is, I found on receiving my latest shipment, a new formula and the carb count has almost doubled from 8g per serving to 15g. This might not matter to most people but for some it can be a critical issue. I imagine it still tastes great with all the extra sugar and milk or whatever they've added but, unfortunately, this product no longer serves the niche it once did. Where it once was this great-tasting, low-carb indulgence, it's now just one of ten million sugary things out there.",0
"The tree does not look as good as the one in the picture. It was packed in too small of a box, thus, from the base of the plant to the tip it curves to form a 90 degree angle. I'm sure I can train it back to being vertical again though. Not a major problem just annoying. Also the leaves are not as healthy or whole looking as I thought it would be. A lot of them are deformed looking in the sense that the leaves are separated in half or thirds the same way as if you were to cut the leaf with a scissors. Color is a little different too. Not as many leaves as the plant in the pic either. Also it was pretty dry.",0
"I've been drinking coffee for a really long time.  I've had lots of coffee from all the major retailers and from every region of the world.  I also get coffee from local fine food stores and lots of stuff on-line.  I have multiple coffee makers, one of them, my daily workhorse, a built-in Miele coffee/cap/espresso maker.  So, I think I know coffee better than most.  This coffee is good but certainly not spectacular.  I adjusted the grind to their recommendations, and I also tried other grind levels without a significant change in my opinion.  Keep in mind that personal palette plays an important role in coffee appreciation, akin to the appreciation of wine, music, or art, so my opinion is still only one opinion.  That being said, I still believe that I can safely state that this coffee, while good, will not change your life.",0
"I found this roast a bit bitter and too dark to be Colombian.  It also tasted oily, something that the regular Colombian from Folger's is not.  I was a little disappointed.  Now that the price for this three-pack has doubled since May 2010 it's even less appealing.<br /><br />If I want a bold, dark roast I'll brew some French roast.  If I want a medium dark roast I'll have regular Folger's Colombian and not this blend.<br /><br />Bummer.",0
"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.",0
"I own a Senseo coffee machine, and another brand machine which I keep at work.  Both use standard size coffee pods, quite successfully, and brew a rich cup of coffee.

This is just a polite warning not to waste your money if your machine is not designed for espresso.",0
"Actually, my dog loved the food.  The food looks and smells good! The bag is very strong and I do love the handy zipper top. Most concerns are with the corn, wheat, and chicken by products.

He seems to enjoy getting the corn soaked in butter bits off the cob.<br /><br />Other dry dog foods, he has not been too happy with.  He has a rather sensitive digestive system, but did not seem to be effected switching directly over to this new food.",0

"In the first place, I am completely satisfied with the taste of this product. As said by another reviewer, the taste is quite milky and not beany at all. In addition, the price is comparatively cheap.<br /><br />What frustrates me is the terrible shipping.

I cannot imagine what kind of shipping service can cause 2 well-packed boxes to leak?<br /><br />If shipping service could be improved, I recommend this product to anyone who likes milky drinks.",0

"A mixed review from the cat family... They loved some of the gloppy varieties, but when I opened a can of ""cutlets"" it freaked us all out as it's big fish chunks, bones and all. I was alarmed picturing that puked up on my bed. My 16-year-old looked at it and me as though I'd gone completely mad and backed away from the dish, as did a younger cat. Noble effort, Tiki Cat, and sorry, but they want their glop. The ""cutlets"" have gone to the outdoor feral tomcats we care for, who thought it was magnificent, but it's a bit too pricey for them to have regularly.<br /><br />**Added: An enthusiastic 5-stars from the cat family on the salmon-chicken variety:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0MFX0"">TIKI Cat Canned Food for Cats, Napili Salmon Chicken Recipe  (Pack of 12 2.8 Ounce Cans)</a>",0

I give this 3 stars for the packaging.  Not too long ago I could buy this in a cardboard tub.  I use gelatin daily and I hate all the packaging.  The tub was perfect.

There is only one thing that I am unsatisfied with this order and that is that all of the bars seem to be stuck to the wrappers and are wet.

"Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices. This may not be as satisfying a treat as doggy biscuits, but I can see this product being useful for training. For instance, if your dog pulls on the leash when you go for walks, stop and call the dog to you. If he listens, let him have a few licks before continuing. I can also see it being useful for dogs who are overweight and whose owners want to cut back on calories yet can still give the dog a little treat for good behavior.",0
"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.",0
"This is a vitamin-containing flavor enhancer for water.  You squeeze this into your water (one squeeze for 8 oz of water).  This gives you some flavor, a bunch of vitamins, and some caffeine.  The flavor of this was reminiscent of Kool-Aid.  For a drink that is supposed to be full of health benefits, this contained an awful lot of artificial colors.  I found this a bit too sweet and a bit too artificial.",0
Not as sweet fruits work the best for me when making smoothies using this product. I usually blend protein with this stuff with water and blueberries. If you're looking to really make a healthy drink try mixing in a tablespoon of Green Vibrance with each smoothy.,0
"I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.",0

"These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.",0
"I don't usually drink any of these coffee mixes, but I am a big fan of anything chocolate and mint so I gave it a shot.  Adding it to boiling water as told in the instructions I would just give it two stars.  When I added it to a cup of coffee with cream it was a little better.  The scent is pretty good and actually smells like mint and chocolate.  The aftertaste tastes like it's supposed to be mint, but not quite.  One look at the ingredients doesn't exactly make your mouth water.  I'll use up the rest of it, but it'll never show up on my shopping list.",0

"I thought the calorie count was good (90 cal) and the fiber count great as well, but I felt the taste was barely above average.  As a few others have pointed out, the chocolate flavor is rather artificial and the texture seemed somewhat gummy to me.  It did satisfy my hunger, though  (perhaps because they aren't overly sweet?).  Much more than other fiber/granola snacks I've purchased.  until something better comes along I will probably buy them again to keep in my desk for a guilt-free 'chocolate emergency' fix even though I'm not crazy about them. (Note: I too bought this box of 38 at Costco for approx $11.  The price shown here is no bargain, and I would definitely lower my rating to 2 or maybe even 1 star if I was paying close to 70 cents for each one!  They are tiny!)",0
"In another addition to the Oreo cookie line, Nabisco added Oreo Golden Fudge Cremes.  These are basically a thin chocolate waffer with peanut butter filling covered with chocolate fudge.  This naturally creates a high caloric and fat content cookie.  My biggest complaint with these are that they left a bitter aftertaste probably from the chocolate waffer.  My kids didn't seem to mind but this is not a cookie that I would go out of my way to buy.  There are similar better tasting cookies out on the market today so I can only give this an average rating.",0
"There is nothing offensive about this tea, but there isn't really anything to commend it either.  With all the herbs, I was really looking forward to tasting what I thought would be a fabulous hot tea and it turned out to be only ""all right"".<br /><br />I enjoy many of this company's red teas (rooibos blends) and usually find teas with this list of ingredients to be very pleasing but the best word I can us to  describe it is bland.  Not much flavor which means I drank the small pot I made without pouring it out, but I won't be making it any more.",0

"Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.  I don't have a pod coffee machine and so I initially thought that I could use these pods much like you would a tea bag.  I steeped it in my boiling water and then smelled the rich aroma and gulped down murky flavored fiery hot water.  It was bland and unappealing.  I've read that you can empty the contents into a conventional coffee machine and use it that way, but it would take a lot of pods to equal out a pot of coffee, and I don't have a conventional coffee maker so that wouldn't help me much.  I actually snatched this up because I thought I could make this like tea, and I wouldn't need a coffee maker.  It smells amazing, but like some other reviewers here, the pod process is a bit of a stumbling block.  I know that they make coffee makers specifically for these pods, but I can't see myself rushing out to buy one.  Just be aware before you buy that this may not be what you are bargaining for.  I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.  Coffee is a great flavoring tool, and so I actually like these pods for that.  I recently cut one of these pods open and crusted pork with the contents.  It was wonderful.",0
"Received the product quickly from Amazon.  First, I muust say that I've bought gourmet peanuts from many suppliers.  These peanuts are good but do not rate as the best I've had.

My rating: 3 out of 5.",0
"I typically am not a huge fan of Starbuck's coffee because it is a little too strong and a little bitter for my taste; so, I wanted to try this thinking it would be slightly milder in flavor.  The smell of this coffee when first opened was amazing.  The vanilla scent was very pleasing to the nose.  The coffee however did not carry the same strong vanilla flavor that the smell had.  My husband who does not like flavored coffees does not mind this flavored coffee at all.  He can taste a slight hint of vanilla which he does not mind.  The flavor for me is not strong enough but I can still use my flavored creamers which is enhanced with the vanilla infused coffee.<br />Basically this coffee is a matter of taste preference.  For us it turned out to be a coffee we both can enjoy.",0
"This water is good, it is possibly the best tasting of the water we had in our taste test which included several well knows brands, grocery store distilled and filtered, as well as in home reverse osmosis. But this was a side by side comparison. All the water we tasted is exceptional on its own.<br /><br />I don't personally believe any health benefits, the small difference in pH from other water seems it would quickly be equalized in the acid digestive environment.<br /><br />I did find some change in baking but it was not a improvement, the high ph seemed to interfere with yeast and pizza dough did not form a quality skin as if the gluten formation was negatively impacted.<br /><br />Conclusion, the water is good, but seems expensive without any appreciable advantage.",0
"Yes, I agree with the reviewer that wants the bigger bags. Less wasted packaging and presumably a better price.",0
"Bought both the aerogarden, and master gardener deluxe kit, for my sister with the brown thumb. Fit and finish seem good, ease of use can't be faulted, and she's already got plants growing in a remarkably short time, which given her success at converting seeds into little blobs of mold is nothing short of miraculous. OTOH, a quick review of what goes into it, from the perspective of a mechanical engineer, suggests  that it's vastly overpriced. I do hope they'll be bringing the price down in months to come. There could be a huge market for it at a  more reasonable price.",0
"I'm glad that Amazon offers the MIO product because I have been curious about it - I grew up as a die-hard soda drinker who's trying to ween off the stuff, and lets face it, water just tastes too boring sometimes. I was hoping that the MIO might be a good way to bridge that gap. Unfortunately for the Peach flavor, it's pretty ""meh"" on all accounts. There is very little peach taste, and what is there tastes very artificial - like what you imagine the scientists thought peach should taste like, but couldn't figure out exactly how to get there. I was also surprised by how sweet it is - even just a few drops in a pint glass and it tasted super saccharine to me. The sweetness also has that hallmark flavor that most sugar substitutes have - that sort of strange, chemically Equal/Sweet n Low taste.<br /><br />Honestly, if you're a water drinker who just wants some sweetness or flavor in your drink, I still think the little plastic honey bear is probably the best bet.",0
"Any Oatmeal is good for you, this brand is not what I expected but it's OK for the price I paid.

"I really love Wellness and really want my cats to eat it, but with the exception of two flavors of the regular wet food, they just do not like it. When one of my cats was a kitten, she loved the Wellness kitten formula, but that was it. I can't get either of them to touch CORE canned or dry food, even with their old food mixed. This has resulted in a number of returns, which really made me appreciate the company's guaranteed satisfaction promise!  I'm trying to narrow it down, but I think they both don't like either the smell or taste of potatoes, rosemary extract, or cranberries. Obviously, very cat has their own taste preferences just like us humans, but I just wanted to caution other owners to try a sample before buying a large, expensive supply...",0
One child hates them; one loves them; I'm indifferent.  I have noticed that some of the individual bars are not fresh because they aren't sealed tight.  Probably won't buy them again.,0
I just received these pretzels but have not tasted them yet because I noticed under the ingredients on the package that it says may contain traces of sesame or poppy seeds.  My son is allergic to sesame seeds and this was not stated on the website under ingredients.  I notified Amazon and they will look into this.,0
"Walkers shortbread thins are a favorite at my house but hard to find. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon even though the price was more than a retail store. But the shipping was free in this case so I bought them. The cookies arrived bundled in a set of 4 boxes as expected. However, every cookie in each box was broken. This does not change the quality taste of these cookies (butter, lemon and raspberry choices) but it definitely limits serving options. I will not likely serve broken cookies at a party or special occasion. I was very disappointed that all the cookies were broken, none were intact. I will be highly hesitant to buy them through Amazon again.",0

"ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />Okay, what I received was not what I bought.  The shipper was not Cultures for Health, and despite the clear description of the product on the Amazon page, I received LIVE cultures, not the dehydrated grains that I thought I had purchased.  It feels very dishonest to me.  I bought this product because someone I trust recommended Cultures for Health dehydrated water kefir grains to me, as they had a good experience with them.  I am not pleased with this apparent duplicity!!<br /><br />I have brewed the water kefir anyway, and will see what results I get from the product.  So far, I have nothing to say (positive or negative) about the quality of grains (i.e., how well they brew, and whether they have longevity).  When that changes (positive or negative), I will weigh in again.<br /><br />REVISION:<br /><br />I have since brewed the water kefir, and it has produced a good product.  So, the grains are good.",0
"I ordered four jars of these great cocktail onions, but got only two, each of which was open and leaking. Don't know whether this was a packing issue or UPS's fault, but the company did promptly replace all four jars at no additional charge either for the product or the subsequent shipping. Hard to argue with the service!",0
The flavor of this product is okay but they are just too sweet.  The texture is more like a firm gumdrop rather than a traditional gummi candy.  Trolli sells a version of this that is a little more fruity/flavorful so it doesn't come off as being so sweet.  They were just okay and I wouldn't buy them again.,0
"Well the good news is that Crystal Light Mocktails are low in calories and sodium as well as being gluten free. The bad news is that a cocktail without the alcohol is like a party without the music. There just isn't any fun. Granted you could ADD alcohol to the product but that's not really the point is it? I mixed up Crystal Light Appletini and the first thing that hits you is the color. Vibrant lime green. Visually pleasing sure enough, but drinks this color are usually targeted toward teenage boys. As for the taste? One of my friends described it as Granny Smith apple juice. I myself think it tastes like apple cider with a hint of Jolly Ranchers green apple. The price is pretty steep, although to be fair each packet in the container can make two quarts so that's something. The packaging is eye-catching and I can see it drawing in customers on aesthetics alone. This product isn't for everyone but I'm sure ladies in their early 20's will love it.",0
"I picked up one of these little ""spicy 12-packs"" last year from a hot sauce shop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I've long been a fan of the Dave's range of sauces and was very taken with the little miniature sampler bottles and the chance to try out so many of their sauces for a relatively good price. The bottles live on my desk at work and I've been merrily sampling my way through them for a while now.<br /><br />This is a great little set that will ensure you always have something slightly different to try depending on your mood, but for the serious lover of outrageously hot sauces like myself, there is nothing new to discover here. That's not a bad thing - these sauces are all as flavorful and complex as you'd expect from this company, and with such a wide range of flavors there's something to match just about any meal. If you're already familiar with some of the hotter sauces in the Dave's range, though, what you won't find here is anything new in the way of sauces that will give you that endorphin rush that comes from a sky-high Scoville rating. By far the hottest of the bunch here is Temporary Insanity (a ""mere"" Insane on the Dave's Insanity scale), and I already had a bottle of that lurking in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm not knocking this set at all, though - it's something that will be appreciated by anyone who likes things slightly on the hot side looking to sample a few and find a new favorite. If you're like me and find yourself going out to eat and wishing the place stocked some decent hot sauce, these little bottles are the perfect size to stash in your bag before you go. I polished off my mini-bottle of Rowdy Red Chile within a few days and refilled the bottle with Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce. That bottle now lives in my purse and comes with me everywhere I go, so never again will I have to endure a breakfast that fails to blow my head off in the expected fashion!<br /><br />I'd love to see a similar set featuring all the REALLY hot sauces in the range (as Dave's is, after all, famous for these!) - that would be something I'd pick up in a second.",0
"To be fair, I have to say that French Roast is not my favorite roast of coffee.  I never buy it in any brand.  If the sample sent to me had been a medium roast I could give it a better rating, probably.  Part of the joy of the experience of drinking coffee, for me, is the smell of a freshly opened bag or can.  The fragrance of this, freshly opened, was of burnt coffee beans.  The flavor, upon making it, was of coffee made with burnt coffee beans.  But, as I say, I have this problem with any French Roast.  As far as low acidity, I think the makers are on the mark.  I'd like to try this brand in a different roast to give it a fair evaluation.",0
"I am a devoted fan of sprouts, so I thought I would try the speckled peas. They were okay, but you need to steam them briefly to bring out their flavor. Since I like the raw sprouts better, I'll only give them a rating of 3.",0

"I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out.  I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well.<br /><br />First off.  The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper.  We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine.<br /><br />The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper.  The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels.  The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again.  The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels.  The Blue Heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels.  Sunset Fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully.",0
"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much.",0
"I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural ""flavors"". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.",0
"While I did get Ice Breakers, I did not get the Pink Lemonade, I merely got the Apple, Tangerine and Watermelon sours. Tasty, but misleading. I give 3 stars since I didn't bother to return em.",0
"I bought the Buster Food Cube to hopefully help with my Spaniel Mix's bad habit of woofing down her meals in a couple of seconds.  I got the cube and was anxious to fill it up, however, it took a while to fill it.  Once it was filled, I put it on the floor and kicked it around for her to help her figure out what she needs to do.  She ate the kibbles as they fell, but unfortunately she's not the brightest dog ever so all she did was lick the hole where the kibble falls out and has to be put in to fill.  I think she successfully knocked it over once or twice, but gave up shortly after that.<br /><br />I think overall the Buster Food Cube has potential to be a good product for a smarter dog.  As for me, I'll just have to keep looking for solutions.",0
"It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6µg (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors).",0
"Bustelo would be my second choice.  Instead, I would recommend trying<br />Mayorga Organic Cafe Cubano.  Mayorga will ship to you. Their beans<br />are nice, fresh, dark and oily.  Great strong coffee.",0
"The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.",0
I got these as part of a wedding present since I love tea. While I loved almost all flavors I especially enjoyed the Forte Breakfast ( Assam Tea) and Mango. My husband really liked Chamomile with citrus and his Lemongrass. We enjoyed al but probably wont be getting it again as this pack. I might go for just one or two flavors again.,0
"This Rooibos Tea has a good taste and is a pleasant change from the Gunpowder Green Tea I usually drink. It is of much finer texture than green and needs at least 50% more ( 1 1/2 tsp.) per cup, to brew a decent cup of tea. That isn't so bad, due to it being greater in volume than Green Tea. Most tea infusion balls would be too small for the amount needed per cup and is best brewed using a fine mesh, cup style infuser. I find to like it better to drink as iced tea and have mixed it with Green Tea, which I think I like the best. All-in-all, it's a great value and I would recommend it for a change of pace. Give it a try..",0
"""Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)"" is ok for what it is. It's easy and quick enough to make; except for the meat, everything you need comes in the box; and the flavor is tangy (if a bit too salty for my tastes). In all, while it wasn't my favorite mac n' cheese dish, ""Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit"" was ok enough that I can give this a slight recommendation.",0

"I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.",0
"I liked this more than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4"">Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce</a>, but that isn't saying much. The sauce is basically ranch dressing mixed with some spices, but isn't all that spicy. Again like the Chipotle sauce, the Spicy Ranchero sauce has a two tablespoon serving that clocks in at 110 calories. For as fatty as these are, you'd think they'd taste better. I'd like to see Taco Bell cut some of the oils out and tweak the spiciness before trying this line again.",0

I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions.,0
I have this product on auto delivery.  I've been getting it for about a year now.  The last shipments must have been defective because they are not as bold as when I first started getting them.  I have been reducing the brew cup size as to get the bold taste.  Disappointing.  Maybe the next shipment will get back on track or I'll need to find a different decaf.,0
I was a little disappointed with the product. We buy similar maple cookies at a local store for much less money. We like them so well we wanted to try a better grade and ordered Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies. The filling was excellent but the cookie itself was not very good.

I just tried the sauce again for the second time today and I'm even more disappointed now.  After reading all the stories people posted here, I seriously thought this was it, but this is far from being ""it"".  I cannot and will not claim, like most of you, that I can handle the hottest of the hot sauces, but this I will say with all honesty: this sauce is a DISAPPOINTMENT!

These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.,0

I hoped there would be more whole raspberries or at least pieces in the filling but could not find many (if any) in two cans.

"I've lived and worked in Scotland, and sought a piece of it to chew on; one can't just imbibe peated malt. But these delicious oatcakes are a bit risky, like running about Scottish crags with a kilt and no unders. Tiny hard bits might impede your bite.

"This is the 2nd Mio product I've tried and I must say that it is a little dissapointing.  There are no guidelines as to what quantity would provide the optimal taste; I suppose that the concept it is ""season to taste"" product.  If you want your beverage to taste more like a weak flavored water, use less--if you want a more pronounced taste use more.  I found in my trials that a few drops are too little, and a squirt can be too much.  I like my drinks to taste like someting, so I've used more.  The sweetness is a bit overpowering; but using less results in a weak drink that I found unpalatable.  I suppose this product is best for those who want tepid tasting flavored water, in that case a few drops would suffice and a bottle would last quite a while.  I found it to be very artificial tasting and not as good as those drink pouches you put in a bottle of water.  The only really good thing about it is that since it is a liquid, it dissolves readily in your bottled water whether the water is room temperature or cold.  So I'd say this product is not for me; but those wanting someting less sweet than your average diet drink mix might find it appealing.",0
"This isn't one of my favorite Stash blends; I feel the hot tea it makes is a little weak.  It does make a delicious iced tea, though, with a fairly pronounced mango taste.  It won't be a regular tea for me, but I'll buy a box now and then to brew a batch.",0
"I am typically a huge fan of all things chipotle - the smoky heat, the warm, earthy flavor - I use the spice in a lot of my cooking.  I thought Taco Bell's Bold and Creamy Chipotle would be an easy, ready-made way to enjoy that flavor.<br />I've tried the sauce on salad and in burritos thus far.  The heat is there, and you do get the chipotle flavor, but along with it is a distinctly fake/preservative-ridden taste that I found unappealing.  In the salad especially, without many other strong flavors to mask it, that artificial taste was particularly offputting.  In the burrito, it blended in better with the beans and rice and left more of the heat/smokiness.<br />Two tablespoons leaves you with 110 calories and a whopping 11 grams of fat.<br />For a quick chipotle fix, this is just OK. I'll be sticking with my own spices.",0

"I bought this formula for my 12 month old baby. He loved it. The taste is great and I have not had the mixing problems mentioned by another review. The only problem is that my son started to wake up at 3am hungry, even though I was giving him the same amount of formula. I looked at the nutrition information and noticed that the formula has less than half the calories that Enfagrow next step has. Once I switched back he started sleeping through the night again. For a growing baby boy who needs all the calories he can get, I do not recommend this formula. There is no price to my baby's health, yet when this cost twice as much as the other brands and still does not fill it is really not worth it.",0
"An admitted fan of Stash Earl Grey, nevertheless I endeavor to try them all.  St. Dalfour seemed intriguing, being a French company instead of British, so I gave it a try.  This tea neither tastes nor smells anything like Earl Grey.  The aroma of the tea upon opening the bag is rather bland with no hint of bergamont.  Believe it or not, the aroma and flavor after steeping are a mild licorice.  I'm serious!  If I was given this tea with no forewarning, I would have assumed it was Licorice Tea.  The flavor is not unpleasant.  It is quite different.  It is definitely not Earl Grey.  Be forewarned if you are seeking an Earl Grey aroma/flavor - this is not it.",0
"Surprisingly, the brewed coffee has a strong chocolate-like flavor, not just a chocolate aroma, as is so often the case, but it hits a false note and leaves an odd aftertaste.  The coffee itself is not bitter and is of average quality for vacuum-packed but it does not seem especially fresh.  So you get a very average cup of coffee with a pronounced chocolate-like flavor that is much improved with milk and sugar.<br /><br />I say chocolate-like because the the flavor is closer to real chocolate than, say, a Tootsie Roll, but it is definitely not real chocolate.  The label indicates that it has both natural and artificial flavors, although they are not specified.<br /><br />All-in-all, I do not think that this product meets the expectations for a carriage-trade coffee set by the packaging and marketing and is merely average.",0
"While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.",0
"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info.",0
"Let me start by saying that I usually use Whey protein.  I decided to try the hemp protein as an alternative.  The bag arrived just as the picture shows with not much other packaging and it was a decent deal when compared to local store hemp protein.  That said, I don't know if all hemp proteins must taste like this one, but it was very difficult to get down.  I usually make a morning smoothie that consists of protein, blueberries, strawberries, soy milk, and cocoa.  Even with the fruit/cocoa in my smoothie the hemp protein taste dominates. And it is very unpleasant. On top of that, it doesn't mix well and therefore gives the smoothie a terrible gritty texture.  For me, unfortunately because of the taste and texture, I will have to stick with whey protein.",0
"I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.",0
"Cute packaging. Fun for kids. The flavor is way more ""mint"" than banana. In fact, you can barely taste the banana at all if you're expecting banana-flavored candies. It's an unusual flavor combination, at best.",0
"The small pieces of chocolate melt incredibly smoothly---much more so than ""normal"" bar or chip chocolate. This makes them perfect for fondue, or for simply stirring into hot milk for a drink. The dark chocolate could be richer and darker; I thought it tasted closer to milk chocolate, and lacks the depth of flavor of really good-quality chocolate.",0
"Received the ""Baby Yellow"" instead of the correct ""Baby White"" kernels. Unable to return the product since it's a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product.",0
"slightly oily<br /><br />Reviewing on Taste is sort of worthless since it is extremely subjective.  I'll offer this.  It has a slightly oily residue. There are no nuts, which is what I wanted but I wanted a dryer texture.<br /><br />Boxed fine no problems on that end.",0

"I decided to pick up O.N.E. coconut water with a splash of passion fruit to diversify my coconut water consumption. I usually just buy pure coconut water. I was surprised at how sweet the drink was given that it had a ""splash"" of passion fruit. Typically after I drink coconut water, I feel refreshed. However, this drink left me with so much of a sweet aftertaste that I felt a tall drink of water was in order after I was done.",0
"I recently discovered buying coffee on Amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience.  I decided to try this based on the rave reviews.  Wish I wouldn't have listened.  Not nearly as good as I expected.  Note that it doesn't taste bad, it's just that it doesn't have much taste at all.<br /><br />Also disappointed in the packaging.  The companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my Amazon box when it showed up.  This could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight.  Will continue to search other coffees on Amazon.",0
"I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.",0
"I bought this for my son's dog which is a bull terrier mix.  Altho it only lasted two weeks before she chewed it up, it did keep her entertained while it lasted.  I would suggest either heavier material or notification on the package about not good for strong chewers.",0
"I didn't hate this but it is almost undrinkable because the pepper burned my mouth and throat a bit. It may be because I used skim milk and I will try it again as soon as I get some Fat-Free Half & Half. It also left a strange chalky after taste in my mouth, once again it could be the skim milk. The sweet factor wasn't too cloying so that was a plus. I think I am used to using tea bags and my favorite right now is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG5IXW"">Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.

"Pops big, tastes great, but the hulls are huge! (Expensive)  I Feel like a dog with peanut butter on my tongue trying to get rid of the hulls that suction cupped to the back of my tongue.

"The cost of Taibi oil is extremely expensive for olive oil, even buying from a small orchard in Sicily. In Sicily, a one litre can of top quality organic oil costs about $12.  This Taibi oil is a bottle half that size so worth about $6.  Can the cost of shipping really be over $40? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another firstclass oil from Sicily available on Amazon for only $20.79 is Mandranova Biancolilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil 17 oz.<br /><br />Olive oil is bottled and released for sale two to five months after pressing. For example, oil that was pressed in the fall of 2010 - as this oil is dated - came to market from February to May of 2011.<br /><br />The shelf life of most extra-virgin olive oils is anywhere from 1 year to 18 months from the bottling date, but it is always a good idea to do as the locals do and buy fresh oil when the new release comes to market.<br /><br />Unlike wine, olive oil does not improve with age, so you can assume a 4-6 month shelf life for opened bottles, and a full year in a sealed bottle from one release date to the next.<br /><br />If you purchase an olive oil that is stronger than you like, just set it aside for a few months and then taste it again. Olive oils gradually mellow over the course of the year.<br /><br />Because olive oil is susceptible to deterioration from air, you may be better off purchasing olive oil frequently, in smaller quantities, rather than purchasing one large container. Most top producers put their oil into dark glass bottles or clear bottles that are covered in a foil wrap. Clear glass bottles allow damaging light to affect the oil, bleaching the color and souring the flavor. Keep your oils away from heat sources, such as a radiator, the backsplash of your stove, or the sun.<br /><br />It is best to keep your olive oil at a slightly cool temperature that does not fluctuate ...but do not refrigerate it.<br /><br />See also the new book:  Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil by Tom Mueller.",0

"If you are used to a dark roast with bold flavor, this sounds like it should do the trick -- but it doesn't.  Even on smaller cup settings, I think those who prefer bold/dark coffee will find this thin and lacking flavor.  Best for those who prefer a medium roast/ breakfast blend cup of coffee.",0
"Following the directions out of the box, the mix worked ""okay"".<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Top quality ingredients.<br />- Whole family ate until we couldn't eat any more. Still that always happens with pancakes and waffles. Strange.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- With no oil content, I had to follow the suggestion of adding a small amount of oil to each batch to prevent sticking. Even with this and a well-oiled Waring Pro, it still stuck. Not sure if this is strictly speaking the mixes fault though, lol.<br />- The real issue is that this is an overly sweet mix. I would suggest buying one with less sugar and just adding additional sweetening if you need it. Try their multigrain component.<br />- Building into the ""pro"" that they use high quality ingredients, I think they could have just gone the extra little bit and made this organic. Why not?<br /><br />Conclusion: Good USA brand. Try the multigrain. Suggestion to brand: go organic.",0

"EDIT: April 2011<br /><br />Despite my previous statement, these are no longer the best baked low fat snack ever. Not anymore. Sadly, they changed the ingredients. They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM). They are baked, not oily, but still taste awesome.<br /><br />You HAVE to try these. I prefer the regular sea salt flavor.",0
"My twin 10-month olds made short work of this one when they were first introduced to it.  Each baby finished a 4 ounce jar of the pears and raspberry flavor Earth's Best very quickly.  Since then whenever they get a jar of it, they react with the same enthusiasm.<br /><br />One reason I indulge them with the Earth's Best brand for the pears and raspberry combination is that it is not so easy for me to get anything like it without buying whole fruit or finding a substitute such as using cans.  I'm so busy with these twins that I don't go far.  This purchase is convenient.  However, with applesauce-based food for the babies, I can buy large and more economical jars at the grocery store (the unsweetened varieties).<br /><br />I'm confident almost any baby will love this Earth's Best flavor combination right away.  Here are the listed ingredients: Organic pears, organic raspberries, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid.  One serving has 25% of the daily vitamin C needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.",0
I saw this product on the Hungry girl show and decided to give it a try.  I ordered choc peanut butter and maple vanilla.  It has more of a frozen yogurt consistency rather than a creamy consistency.  If you can get past that.. the maple vanilla is really delicious.  I was not as satified with the choc peanut butter and am a little disappointed that I spent all that money on it.  I would be willing to try other flavors though.<br />Definitely good subsitute for if youre on a low cal diet.<br />I read some reviews about shipping time... my order was shipped within 3 days and I had no issues.,0
"Let's get the unpleasant stuff out of the way first:<br /><br />1. Calling this product ""clusters"" falls somewhere between false advertising and a grand exaggeration. Sure, there may be clusters in there (though I had to go spelunking to find them), but by no means are clusters a primary element of this snack.  That vast majority of the bag I received was loose bits.<br /><br />2. I opened the bag on the day I received it from Amazon and the first smell that hit me was rancid grain or oil--you know, when a box of cereal or crackers (or even a jar of peanut butter) go bad, they have that nasty stale smell?  Well that is what this smells like (at least the bag I got).  The ""best by"" date on the bag is August 29, 2012, so clearly the product is not outdated.  I HATE the rancid smell and will throw away snacks, cereals, crackers, etc., as soon as they start smelling that way, so it was tough to push past it to even try the granola.<br /><br />Now for the better news:<br /><br />1. While the product's strong rancid smell is off-putting, the taste is relatively pleasant (as long as I hold my breath or hold the bag away from my face when I'm pouring it out of or grabbing it from the bag to avoid the smell). There is SOME rancid taste, but I've been able to continue eating the granola on yogurt, ice cream or oatmeal--just not by itself.<br /><br />2. The package makes the following claims about this product: 5g fiber (per 1/3 cup serving), 720 mg Omega-3, gluten free, 100% whole grains, all natural, low glycemic, no refined sugars, NON GMO (whatever that means), no saturated fat or trans fats, cholesterol free and very low in sodium.  That's all pretty good news if you're looking for a healthier granola.  Total fat is 3.5mg per serving, sodium 20 mg, total carbs 22g, protein 3g and sugars 6g.  Also, as noted in the product title, the granola contains flax seeds.<br /><br />3. The crispy crunch on this stuff is awesome. I'm not sure what causes it, but it has a much lighter crispy type of crunch than most granola I've had (though admittedly I am not a big consumer of granola). I love it sprinkled on my ice cream and yogurt and even started putting it on my oatmeal.<br /><br />4. At 6g sugar, it is not super sweet, which is great.  It has a nice cinnamon taste and enough sweet for me but not too sweet.  They use evaporated cane juice and molasses for sweeteners.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would I buy it again?  *IF* I could be assured that I would never get another bag that smells rancid, yes I would.  Otherwise, probably not.",0
"Usually, I buy store brand macaroni and cheese but these were going to be roughly the same unit price.  I thought that the brand name item would be better than the generic, so I bought a pack of six.  Honestly, the generic is better.  The cheese sauce in the Kraft is not as creamy, and it doesn't have as strong of a cheese taste.  It seems like there is just enough cheese sauce to barely cover the noodles even though I squeezed as much out of the package as I could.  Overall, it's okay and we'll eat what we bought, but I'm sticking to the generic when I need to buy more.",0
"We use dog food in here...but it all falls out of the hole pretty quickly! I'm not sure if there are certain kinds of treats that would work better in here, but it does not work as well as i thought it would. Although, when it is empty, my dog likes to play around with it. So I guess it entertains him and that's always good! (6 mo. old yellow lab)",0
"These pale in comparison to the ones of the early 80's. Flavors please with the exception of the lemon, which has a chemical note. And I swear that they are smaller in circumference.

"I liked the coffee, it was bold but not bitter. I can't recommend though, due to at least 6 k-cups ""blowing up"" in my Keurig.<br /><br />The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K-Cup breaks and coffee / grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single ""blow up"".",0
"I tried the sister product, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98"">Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce</a> in August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.<br /><br />As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN40"">Cheez-It Hot & Spicy</a>; they got ""bold"" with that one.<br /><br />The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.<br /><br />The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.<br /><br />The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.<br /><br />The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.<br /><br />This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.<br /><br />Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO"">Sriracha</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZHPFI"">Crystal</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFRJSA"">Cholula</a>, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.",0
Title says it all. There really is nothing special about this drink. It's virtually indisguishable from many other carbonated drinks out there.

"Kitchens of India has an overall great line of Indian foods. Unfortunately,the Kashmiri pilaf is mediocre at best. It ends up incredibly dry.... and while it is surprisingly spicy, it's best paired with a cucumber raita or anything yogurt-based to cut the burn. One isn't forewarned on the spiciness. Even salsa bottles are more instructive.<br /><br />On the upside,a CD of Indian classical music accompanies the meal. It's an hour's worth of music with Ustad Amjad Ali Khan on the sarod. It's beautiful and contemplative. The meal is forgettable,but the music is worth keeping!",0

But turned out to be the same size and same quality.",0
"I regularly drink herbal iced teas at home, but I also bring powdered flavor packets and bottled water to drink at work.  I much prefer the flavor of real iced tea, but flavored water can be a good convenient and cost effective drink while away from home.  The MIO flavoring is a good concept for flavoring water easily since you don't have to deal with messy powders  (which often seem to spill and go everywhere), but it has some flaws that keep it from being a great product.<br /><br />I have tried two different flavors of MIO, and those were the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea.  The Peach Tea is much better than the Mango Peach (which is unbearably acidic).  As far as taste goes, it's pretty good for a drink flavoring, but about on par with various powdered flavor packets I've tried.  This wouldn't be a bad option if it were pretty cost-effective...<br /><br />So, let's talk price.  These things are not cheap.  They are about $5 a piece and even though they flavor multiple drinks, I ended up having to use two whole squirts to get it to an acceptable flavor level.  This is more than their recommended amount of one squirt.  So, really, the value is not that great here.  However, if you are interested in MIO despite its price, just try the Peach Tea one because it was the best tasting of the two I tried.",0
"I was expecting the  strawberry flavored CLIF kid Organic Twisted Fruit to contain strawberries, but the ingredient list doesn't mention strawberries at all. It is made from organic apple puree and apple juice concetrate and ""organic flavors"" (whatever that means).<br />The list of vitamins and minerals is rather extensive, and I don't doubt the ""One Serving of Fruit"" claim is valid. So it is a relatively healthy snack.<br />How does it taste? Very tart with a flavor similar to old strawberry preserves.<br />Will kids eat it? Yes. After trying one, my daughter took a few to school with her.",0
"I was sent this illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink in Cappuccino flavor by Amazon Vine for review. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />I love good strong coffee, lattes and cappuccino. I did not love this drink. I was looking for a strong coffee taste. Instead I got a diluted drink with a noticeable low-fat taste and a somewhat unusual aftertaste. The chocolate flavor was non-existent, the low-fat milk flavor overpowering. Perhaps chilled over ice would improve the drinking experience, but I'm not interested enough to try another can.<br /><br />On the good side: the beverage contains only 100 calories. However, this is offset by the bad: 18 grams of sugar.",0

"I gave 3 stars for  some good ingredients but this does absolutely nothing for me.  My daily vitamin does more.  I think it's the caffeine.  I guzzle caffeine daily  (yes, I know it's bad for me and I'm not going into why I do that..) so if that was what was spiking people's energy then no wonder I feel nothing.  I was hoping to find something that helped me with a more natural energy but this isn't it.<br /><br />Those of you that are thrilled with it's energy-giving properties, do you think it's the caffeine?  Are you used to drinking caffeine?  If not, that could be why you feel so excited about this..  NO healthy drink powder should contain caffeine.  There is no reason for it! I'm trying to get off caffeine and bought this not knowing it was there.  Stupid me but shame on the company for passing this off as a ""superfood"" then throwing that in.",0
"I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.",0
My doggies give me a hard time when I have to give them a pill. These work especially when I give them fish oil for their coats. I split the pockets as they are too expensive to use on a daily basis.  They love the flavor. They do not like cheese - go figure??,0
"I often use the pouches of food and I thought this would be so great!  My only complaint is that the hole is all the way at the top of the spoon so the food pools up there.  You have to shake it to move it down or overload the spoon.  I still like it and I use it a lot when I'm out, but I wish the hole was a little more centered or towards the front.  I have no idea how that would work (constructionally), but it would be easier feeding.",0
"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",0
"This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky.",0
Be sure when you order this product that you do not want the latte. It was my first order with the K-Cups and I ordered the wrong thing.,0
"I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon.  I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea.  There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing.",0
"I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining.",0
"I love the packaging and ability to make the drink as strong as I want. The flavor isn't as great as the packaging, though this is the most appealing of the three I've tried. Definitely for people who don't mind artificial sweetener taste.",0
"I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.<br />In hot humid weather it is also really hard to get them out of the wrapper. You can put them in the fridge for a while, but unless you are working on craft or cookery projects or run a store, don't buy in bulk in warmer months or if you live in warmer climates.",0
I only have one major issue. Because of the texture of jerky in general it really gets stuck in your teeth and becomes a bit of a chore to eat.,0
"These last for about a week after opened, they taste alright but not worth the extra price.  Would go to your local Whole Foods to pick up something better.",0
"I first purchased Paula Deens House seasoning at Big Lots and loved ,loved,loved this seasoning. When looked for more to purchas I looked everywhere and was thrilled to find the best price on Amazon. So I ordered 4 bottles. I couldn't be more disappointed to find the spices are not the same. The taste is not the same ....Why ??? If you make a produce that is good don't change it..",0
"Long wait! I suppose it's my fault for ordering from the webstore as I am in CA and I think this comes from the east coast so it took forever to get here. My dog and I are loving this food so far. TMI but seriously, her poos are so small and barely smell. She liked it dry, which is kind of funny, but I do wet it sometimes. The feeding guidelines are a little ambiguous, so I plan to call Addiction directly. As for the store (Whole Health Pet, I believe), they are great! As I mentioned the wait was long, but I ordered from them twice and both times received a couple of samples and goodies for my dog; a sample packet of another grain-free Addiction flavor and a freeze dried meat treat - great attention to detail!",0
"It was pretty hard to judge the quality of the cookies because of the condition they arrived in: several were smashed into crumbs and none of them were oriented correctly in the container. They had that oily look that cookies acquire when they've been overheated. The packaging just doesn't seem well-suited to being shipped individually: the cookies have so much room to move inside the package that even with all the packaging Amazon fitted around it, they effectively self-destructed from the handling.<br /><br />That said, they were reasonably tasty soft cookies with an extra kick of chocolate in them. Nothing close to home made, but a decent alternative to other store-bought varieties.<br /><br />For comparison purposes, I picked up a pack of these from the local grocery store, and it was an entirely superior experience. Even the price was better than through Amazon.",0
You'll want to cut the larger sections and rinse the grit off them before putting them into soup. My first experience with using dried mushrooms. The shipping and handling is a bit much for the weight.,0
"This is my first time trying this product, and I was slightly disappointed by them.  Certain flavors (particularly the yellow and green) left a strange flavor lingering in my mouth for a long time after I'd eaten just one of them.<br /><br />The fruit gems themselves did not fit very securely in the packing.  As soon as I removed the outer plastic wrap, I found the box covered in a sticky layer of sugar.  Inside the box, the gems had become all muddled up and were no longer in their set places.  The box was not divided into separate ""spaces"" for each gem, but instead split into two compartments where the gems were all just sort of tossed in together. I was hoping for some better presentation, and if this had been a gift, I would have been quite upset.  Additionally, the ratio of colors seemed somewhat poor:  I got a lot of reds and yellows, but very few yellows and greens, and not a single white one.  Not one!<br /><br />I didn't like these sweets much, because the yellows and greens (as I mentioned) left a particularly odd aftertaste and made my tongue feel weird.  The reds and oranges were not as strongly affected by this weird flavor, and I enjoyed them more.  They were quite irresistible!<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will be buying this product again.  The strange aftertaste was off-putting, and I would have been more disappointed by this product if there had been more greens and yellows in the box. I am glad that I mainly got reds and oranges; but this might not happen next time.  (I really liked the red and orange gems though, and wish I could just buy a box full of only them.) I didn't think that the gems were presented very attractively in their box, and would have definitely preferred that at least the colors be split up more cleanly - this would perhaps help with quality control too, and ensuring an even ratio of each color.<br /><br />I gave the product three stars because I felt it had poor quality control due to not having a very even ratio of flavors.  I, as I say, was glad that I mainly got reds and oranges, but if those are not your favorites, then it might be something of a letdown.  Anyone who loves the white gems would have been horribly disappointed if they had gotten my box - there wasn't a single one in them!<br /><br />I also give it three stars on account of the strange after-taste.  It spoiled things somewhat for me.  I was glad that it was only certain colors that were affected, or else I would not have been able to eat these gems at all.  I found that I was only able to have one of the gems that had an odd flavor, before the after-taste got too much for me.",0
Tasted my first 8 ounce cup with the usual amount of sugar. It's fair I guess for a medeum roast coffee but homestly I've had better & I won't be buying any after my 15 count pack runs out. Sorry this one's not a winner as the caffiene is on the weak side however the flavor seems to be good. Unless your not looking for that morning coffee wakeup then I'd pass on this one.,0
"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.",0
"I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience.",0
"This coffee is quite good, though I've had other Sumatra coffees with richer, deeper flavor. Since there's no roast date or expiration date on the Camano Island coffees, perhaps it was not too fresh, losing some flavor.",0
"This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.",0
"We tried this based on how much we loved RJ's black licorice, but even my wife, who is a big red licorice fan, was disappointed with this red version.  We found it bland and lacking in flavor, and without the wonderful consistency that the black has.",0
"Since I absolutely love the regular peach Crystal Light I thought I'd try the peach/mango. I don't know what it is about this particular one, but it has an aftertaste that made me sick. I'm either going to have to throw away the remainder of the box or see if someone at work wants it.<br />This is very disappointing because I love mango as much as I love peach.",0
"Dark chocolate is all about marketing and has little to do with quality. Chocolate connoisseurs know better but constitute a small fraction of the gourmet consumer base.<br /><br />Godiva chocolates are delicious and have a wonderful texture. They taste better than Sees Chocolates. Unfortunately, they just don't satisfy my chocolate craving.<br /><br />It's a shame what qualifies as chocolate here. In the US, dark chocolate must contain 15% chocolate liquor; European rules require 35% cocoa solids. American milk chocolate must contain 10% chocolate liquor; European standards require 25% cocoa solids. That means American milk chocolate is 90% not. No wonder those drug store easter chocolates taste so horrible.<br /><br />The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike. I doubt real vanilla costs that much more per box of chocolates.<br /><br />Get a Valrhona pure chocolate bar (see other comments on where to purchase or buy conveniently from Amazon). They make one which contains 85% cocoa!",0
"It's good for a GF food but as all GF foods go, you really have to watch this for the second it is done as it gets very mushy fast.  We are a family of 5 with 3 of those are under the age of 6, and we have to use 2 bags for a meal.<br /><br />Also, I have found that draining it turns it into glue.  I have to keep it in the water and drain each spoonful as I put it on the plate.",0

"The first time I fed this to my dog (mixed in with his other food), he quickly devoured it.  I thought, ""Wow!  I've scored a homerun with this one!  He loves it!""  However, I have noticed since I started feeding it to him that it really upsets his stomach.  He doesn't get sick, per say, but his poor little tummy makes the strangest noises and he tries to eat grass the entire time we're outside on a walk.  When I feed him just his other food, he has no problem.  I won't be buying this food again.  One review said that it was like McDonald's for dogs-- I believe it.",0
"I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.<br />All of the Keurig K-Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this breakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.<br />Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.",0
"I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob-a-lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob-a-lot.",0
"Decent tasting seaweed.  I have several Korean friends who have prepared Korean meals for me, often including seaweed.  I tried this hoping it would be the same thing.  It tastes decent, but not as good as what I am used to, and not as crunchy as some of the other stuff I have tried.  My biggest frustration is the packaging.  If you are trying to eat a few packets in the car, the numerous small packets leave a lot of extremely light/thin plastic that won't just stay in a cup holder or other trash holder.<br /><br />Pros:  Good price, large quantity, fairly good taste<br /><br />Cons: Packet size (trash left after opening)",0
"I like these candy blocks. As it's stated in other reviews, the picture is misleading, there are no purple or white blocks. The bag I got was mostly green and yellow. I haven't found a single 1x2 block either.",0
"This is the first time to try protein shakes. Strawberry banana is not bad, but not great. Can't wait to try the other flavors.<br />I can't comment on Whey protein versus the other and dissolving is not an issue when mixing. I am quite content with my purchase.",0
The pieces were awfully small(maybe piglet ears). Not much to chew on . For a dog over 50# maybe one good bite.,0
"As others have noted, this jerky is chopped and formed.  It also is too greasy for my taste, but for those who like a rich jerky, it may be just what you are looking for.",0
"We were so excited  to make this wine for summer parties. We were very disappointed to have it arrive damaged with liquid leaking through the packaging.  Needless to say we were not comfortable making it due to the possibility of bacteria issues.  We contacted Amazon and were very pleased with the way the issue was handled, they resolved it quickly.  We have ordered wine kits through Amazon in the past and will not hesitate to do so again, this was likely just one of those things that happens sometimes during shipping.",0
"I was so excited to try the new flavors (coffee and cookies and cream.) But i must say, i was a little disappointed. The coffee flavor isn't that strong and the after taste is kinda odd. I couldn't keep the original recipes of the vanilla, chocolate, pb chocolate, and mint chocolate cookie in my freezer for long periods of time bc i loved them that much and ate them ALL the time (i haven't tried the new recipes of them yet.) But I have had the coffee and the cookies and cream in there for months. I can't eat more than a couple spoonfuls of those 2 flavors at a time. They're not gross; they're just no where near as good as the others. And for the cost of them, in my opinion, this one just isn't worth it. I won't be buying this flavor again.",0
"I loved the Jalfrezi and Madras sauces so much, I thought my beloved Tikka Masala would surely be just as wonderful.... but no.<br /><br />I can't even say it's particularly flavorful.  If you prefer VERY mild flavors, this is the sauce for you.  I found it disappointing.  Go for the Jalfrezi or Madras sauces instead.",0
"My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.  He was so impressed, we ordered it again. That (second) batch was disappointing - not nearly as full-flavored as the first.  I'm ordering it just one more time, hoping that the poorer quality was a fluke.",0
"Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....",0
The peaches are tasty ... great for the Jello mold ... BUT ... the majority of the cans looked like they've been individually stepped on. Are these supermarket rejects?,0
"Everyone's taste is subjective but here is my 2 cents worth. I'd read all the reviews so my expectations were minimal. I can honestly say I was mildly surprised as there was a slight peanut smell to the product. I used it on a toasted English muffin & it wasn't that bad (although it didn't melt at all). For my money, it tastes similar, & certainly no worse than Better 'n Peanut Butter. It wins out over BnPB which has 100 calories per 2 T serving. But PB2 easily tastes more authentic than either of them, but PB2 does have 45 calories per 2T serving. And PB2's other drawback is that it's a hassle to mix. But if I'm not dieting, it's REAL peanut butter for me.",0
"This coffee is really more a light roast and I prefer at least a medium roast.  It does have good flavor and aroma, just more on the light roast side.",0
"Would've given 5 stars except for the horrible odor.<br />Pros: Thicker than expected and most definately at least 12 inches long.<br />Came in a high quality resealable plastic bag so the odor won't leach out into the air.<br /><br />Cons: The smell! Oh, the smell!<br />But, I suppose, in their defense, they are only around $2.50 a piece and my pet store sells odorless ones for $6 a piece.  So the savings are quite substantial and my doggies didn't mind the smell in the least.<br /><br />I might order again, not sure yet.",0
"Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness.",0
"I bought this coffee because I like Dunkin D. which also is arabica beans. After reading reviews I just knew this would not only give me that flavor I love but it is also organic. I am quit disappointed. It is a dark, strong flavor but I can't say it's good. I really did want to like it but it did not pass my taste test.",0
"I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning.",0
"I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k-cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of ""light."" It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k-cups that are in a darker yellow package.",0
good information about each ballpark but dated in the presentation even though it was just released in 2009 - it had to be filmed in the late 80s when Comiskey and Tiger Stadium were still open. Each segment is about 20 minutes and provides a decent summary and inoformation about each of the 4 parks.,0
I bought these due to the wonderful reviews. My 3 rating is based on my dogs who seem to love these little patties/treats. But upon receiving the bag the majority of these soft cookie size patties had crumbled into nothing but tasty dust on the bottom of the bag. No handing out this as a treat or as a food patty you would have to pour the crumbs into a bowl. The packaging or shipping would need to change to keep these in their original round cookie/patty shape. Due to the condition of these patties I would not order these again (sorry doggies). When you have a few dogs like I do you need them in the correct measured size so you know each dog gets the same/right amount. They will be missed though!,0
"I have been looking for a good organic genmaicha in a tea bag style.  This is not bad, but the flavor is weak, or maybe the portion per bag is too small, and I have to use two bags to get the flavor I get from my favorite (non-organic) genmaicha.  And even then, the flavor is just okay.  So, I will use what I have but continue to search for that perfect organic genmaicha.",0

"I received two free samples to try out and I decided to try the first one on the night I did my job until midnight. I had gotten up at six am and knew I would be up until past midnight so I decided to try the first one after dinner to see if it would help keep me up until midnight, I didn't think it was going to taste very good but I was presently surprised, I certainly didn't feel any different than I did before I drank it but I did decided to try the next one the next night with no change, I guess I just have natural energy :)I did not have any jitters or anything like that which I was worried about.<br /><br /> I would rather drink that then soda if it works, maybe I had too much caffeine before, I will try it again<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.""",0
"Generally, I like having a box dinner around for times when I don't want to cook much or run out of other foods.  And we have a homemade chicken broccoli and rice casserole we really like, so I thought we'd like this.  For the first few bites we did, but quickly the cheesy taste became extremely rich and unappetizing.<br /><br />The box contains an orzo pasta, a packet of dried seasonings, a packet of dried broccoli, and a large foil packet of Velveeta cheese. To make this, you brown up some chicken breast that has been cut into bite size pieces, then add the orzo and spices and water.  After it simmers a while, add the broccoli and simmer more, then add the cheese sauce.  It's pretty simple, much like any other box dinner on the market.<br /><br />The orzo pasta was very good, I liked it a lot.  The seasonings seemed kind of bland but were adequate.  The broccoli is nonexistent, really.  It's just about 2 tablespoons of dried flakes that don't rehydrate much when cooking.  You can see little tiny green dots throughout the finished dish, but there is no broccoli flavor to speak of.  Frankly, I thought there was too much cheese sauce as well.  About an ounce less of sauce would have been perfect.  It coated everything well and looked good, but the cheese sauce was the main culprit in making the entire dish overly rich in both taste and texture.  We paired this with fresh raw veggies for something to cut the cheesiness and it still was too much.<br /><br />I think this particular skillet would have been better without chicken in it, instead as a side dish with some chicken made separately.  If Velveeta made a boxed side dish that was just orzo, seasoning, and cheese in appropriate proportions, I would definitely buy it.",0
"AirHeads have always been one of my favorites! And I've been looking forward to try new flavors such as ""white mystery"", ""green apple"", etc. I'm giving this product 3*** only `cause there's an incorrect info in product description (I'm sure it isn't Amazon's fault, 'cause it's sold by third party. Although, they could've been more accurate about the content (flavors) in the box). In my case, instead of ""green apple"" (which I love!) I got ""pink lemonade"" (which, ironically enough, I really hate!). Other than that - no complaints! Fast delivery, great condition! Thanx!",0

It is really scary.<br /><br />My dog is like family to me.

"BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!",0

"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.",0
"Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.<br /><br />This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.<br /><br />It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test.",0

"Our cat may be very finicky, but he is attracted to food that is really chunky.<br />So, I have to say this Fancy Feast was not as ""chunky"" as the name suggests.However, the cat eventually eats the food, and I'm sure it is excellent nutrition. Only comment is that this appears to be a slightly chunky pate, not a meal of meaty chunks.",0

"In Grocery:  If You Care No. 4 Coffee Filters, 100-Count Boxes (Pack of 12) by If You Care<br />$42.00<br />I ordered two cases of coffee filters, I use #2 filters. one case arrived it was exactly what I ordered, then the second case arrived it was the #4 filter. I got in touch with amazon, they said no return'S, that I had ordered the case of #4's I did not, I have absolutely no use for #4 filters. They finally agreed to credit me with $30.00 they would not give me a full refund, they would not send me the #2 filters which I ordered and they would not let me send these filters back. I am satisfied with the #2 filters I got, I am not satisfied with Amazon's return policy, and realize thaT this is why buying over the internet is a dicey proposition.<br />  A very unsatisfied customer",0
"I ordered this sampler because I wanted ALL coffee. The name of the sampler is ""Keurig Coffee Only Sampler Pack"", so I think my expectations were reasonable. However, I ended up with apple ciders and hot chocolate. The other problem is that I only got 1 decaf k-cup in the entire pack. The coffee that was in the sampler was top-notch, but unfortunately it wasn't a 5-star experience.",0

"My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.",0
"As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4""), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley.",0
"Since we cannot assign half star ratings, I have to say I would give this product a 2.5 which rounds to 3 stars.  This is probably one of my least favorite of the available flavors available for the Dolce Gusto coffee machine.  I personally am not a ""frou-frou"" coffee/latte expert by any means, so my rating is based on my own personal experience with just this product.  I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased when it comes to rating something like this.<br /><br />I have to agree with another reviewer who said this coffee looks better than it tastes.  I mentioned in a review of another flavor that I don't care too much for the milk, and I think that may be what primarily affects my opinion of this particular flavor; I find it too has an aftertaste and even a powder-like feel.  I do not feel that the available hot chocolate version suffered from this as much.",0
"This tea is OK for the price, but I drink a couple of other organic black teas that are top notch. The other teas may be a little more expensive, but I drink three to four cups a day and want to have a taste that is strong, robust, and really packs a punch. If your going organic with some of your daily products, CHECK AROUND!, there are differences.",0
"My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.",0

"I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.",0
"This soup has a decent flavor, of split peas and potatoes. It is however, a bit too salty for me, but I'm not a fan of salt anyways. The texture is the worst part, and can almost be described as 'gelatinous'. The soup is thickened with a bit too much Potato and corn Starch. I like thick soups, but prefer if it isn't goopy.<br /><br />The best part of this soup is the nutrition. It contains a whopping 14g of protein per box! And only 200 calories (100 per serving)!! Because of this alone, it is my favorite lunch at work, and can last me until dinner without being high in calories. I will continue purchasing this.",0
I was disappointed that when I received these that they were not wrapped individually... but they are beautiful.  I had to buy wrappers at the store an wrap them myself.,0
"Shipping was quick and pricing significantly below what I was paying at the local pet supply stores.  Items were packaged well and there was no overwhelming smell when opening the package.  I have 2 dogs and both like these items very much. My issue is the smell while the dogs are chewing on the bully sticks.  I have read on the Internet that some bully sticks do not stink when being consumed.  The claim is that the bully sticks are prepared by draining them of fluids at some point in the processing.  I've purchased these sticks at pet supply stores for between $2 and $4 each.  These are no different.  My personal expectations was there would be less smell, thus the 3 star rating. However, I need to emphasize that the product was delivered quickly which is important.  I'm sure if my dogs could rate these they would give a 5 star rating.  One of my dogs will finish off a stick in about 20 minutes while the other smaller dog may only be less than a fifth through the stick in 20 minutes. From this perspective they do keep the dog busy, and I'm supposing that it is accurate that these treats are much better for your dog than than the rawhide chews. My dogs love those too but get gassy eating them.  I've read that dogs don't digest them very well.<br /><br />I would definitely buy from this source again if I find out that it is a myth that some bully sticks don't stink while the dogs are chewing on them. I've not seen any statement to that effect on any packaging thus far so it very well may be a myth. I'm going to look around a little more for the elusive bully sticks that don't stink.",0
"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.",0
"These are about the closest thing many have found to the Carnation breakfast bar of the 70s, 80s and, I believe, the early 90s.  That classic Carnation bar (particularly the chocolate chip variety) had a flavor and consistency unmatched by any snack around.  The old ""you can't eat just one"" cliche was true for many, and these things were pretty substantial.  Thousands have signed a petition to get them back, but it's unlikely to do any good.  Anyway, back to the Quaker Chewy Dipps chocolate chip variety - they're a better substitute than most, but on their way down in quality.  The chocolate chips have become nearly non-existent, and I just noticed the ""chocolatey"" covered granola bar designation.  ""Chocolatey"" is a term food companies use when they want to consumers to believe a product contains genuine chocolate, when it actually does not.  They're still pretty tasty, but with more and more corners being cut (yes, I know chocolate is becoming more scarce and expensive), they are probably on the way out.",0

"Being diabetic, ""fake sugar"" is the norm.....LOVED regular Swiss Miss.................but................this is just too sweet for me.  Suggest using half a packet.

"I bought this thinking it was your typical active dry yeast you get in the store, but I was mistaken.  It is compressed, meaning you have to add extra water to it when you start out, let it sit, then you can proceed to use it like you do the yeast in the store.  Still excellent yeast for an excellent price, just not quite as convenient as I would have liked.",0
"The fresh tasting corn, no additives! I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this can't be beat.",0
"Add a few drops of Mio's Sweet Tea water enhancer to a glass of water and it transforms ordinary water into something like the flavored waters you can purchase at the grocery store. The Sweet Tea liquid did give the water a tea-like taste, but don't expect it to taste just like sweet tea. It's more like essence of sweet tea. I found that I needed to add a bit more than suggested to give it enough flavor to my liking. As I'm not a diet-beverage fan, I didn't care for the slight diet-taste that the beverage had.<br /><br />Diet drink fans looking for something different should give this a try. It's a nice alternative to carbonated beverages.",0
"Since this is organic, they water decaffeinate it.  This means that instead of using high pressure C02 they use water.  This removes some of the flavor from the leaves but allows it to be organic.  C02 is not harmful, but the process is no longer organic.  There are other methods of chemically removing the caffeine, but those are considered a bit risky to longer term health.<br /><br />This tea is okay.  I would not expect the flavor from the English breakfast with caffeine.  If you are interested you should look up how to decaffeinate your own tea with water on Youtube.  You'll understand how the tea gets this way.<br /><br />As someone who has to worry about blood pressure genetically I watch my caffeine intake closely.  If you are a big tea person though stick to the stuff with caffeine and decaf it yourself.",0
"My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat.",0
"These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.",0
"I know ""Sweet Potato and Chicken"" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a ""Limited Ingredient Diet"" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for ""chicken fat"" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members.",0
"The coffee is ok, nothing special.  I will like to find this product at a better price.",0
"The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good ""well being"" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.",0
"This is sooooo good - I cannot stop eating it!  If they threw in some of their dried strawberries, it would be the ultimate perfection.<br /><br />However, the mix is sooo tasty... it's going to start becoming lunch and/or dinner!<br /><br />**Update**<br />This product has changed. It used to come in a plastic tupperware-style container and now comes in a bag. That change I like. However, the quality and taste of the dried fruit also seems to have changed. Sadly, it's gone downhill :(<br /><br />The fruit before used to have several different types and flavors. Now, they primarily taste like light caramel popcorn and are not nearly as delicious. For the price, I'm afraid I won't be ordering again.",0
"This case of Libby's carrots arrived in good shape; the case of cans itself was shrink wrapped in plastic plus packing material to protect the case in the packing box. However, the cans in the CENTER of the case were severely dented. The cans on the exterior were perfect. This occurred with 5 cases of different Libby's vegetables. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who did this. Guess Libby's packers were instructed to slip the damaged ones in the center; even if you saw this case displayed in a store you would never know till you paid for them & opened them up, & then it's too late. Amazon has been great about this issue, but the fault was not Amazon's, it is clearly Libby's. The carrots are fine but I took off a star for Libby's sneaky practice & for paying for 12 cans and having to throw out 4. What a disgrace. If this happens to you,  call & let them know; it is totally unacceptable.",0
"Nice that they are biodegradable, but the bags are a little small and the holes in the bag are badly placed. Can cause you a problem if you are not careful, if you know what I mean. Bags are also a little slippery and tend to slide down as you are picking up after your dog. These bags are not horrible and do work OK if you are very careful. I would not use these if I had a large dog. They are inexpensive, but you get what you pay for and I think there are better options out there.",0
"Yeah, Taco Bell isn't exactly associated with healthy living. While it may say Taco Bell on the label the sauces are actually manufactured by Kraft Foods. They pay Taco Bell to slap their name on the label and voila you get a more recognizable brand. The sauce is pretty typical. It's tangy, creamy with a little spice to it. Great for dipping. Try it out if your a fan of the flavor.",0
"I bought this cake mix in hopes of making a great carrot cake.  The other reviewers loved it, but I was disappointed.  The texture comes out odd and somewhat gummy, and the overall taste is a bit off.  It's fine to satisfy a sweet tooth, but nothing to write home about (unless it's in a review).",0
"The 12 individually wrapped cookies came in good condition. The Mocha Capp is not my favorite flavor, but is a nice change and smells great out of the toaster oven.",0
"Maybe I should have picked up on the name ""Jerkee"" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says ""nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed"" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist ""jerkee.""  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand.",0
"I tried this Starbucks coffee thinking that it would be a more mild roast coffee in order for the ""real vanilla"" flavor to show through.  It smelled good and I had high hopes for a true vanilla flavor mixed with a high quality coffee.  What I tasted was a very robust, deep roast, coffee with a bit of vanilla flavor.  It's just not what I prefer.<br />I can't say that i hated it but nor can I say that I loved and would put it on my groccery list.  I was unimpressed and will still hope for something better.",0
"I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it.",0
"I gave up drinking coffee because I always added creamer and sugar, thus I have been trying lots of different teas. This is a decent flavored tea, though not on the top of my list. Wish you could mix and match a case.",0
"My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.",0
It has artificial as well as natural flavoring - I don't know why they bother with artificial when using a natural flavor would be just as easy - and more fitting to a tea leaf.,0
"This product is very expensive but my dogs love them. I can get them to do what ever I want as long as they know they are getting these as a reward but then again, I can also use cheap hot dogs with the same results. If you have money to burn, then buy this, if not, stick with store brand hot dogs cut up into small pieces.",0
"I'm a big fan of snack bars, as I often eat them at work when I'm facing late afternoon hunger.  I tried this Fruition Strawberry Bar and had mixed feelings on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Texture.  It reminds me of a Fig Newton's texture.  It's not crumbly, so it won't make a mess (which is a big bonus for snacks on the go).  But it also isn't too gooey and sticky.<br />- Two servings of fruit in each bar.  Since very few people get their full allotment of fruits in a day, this definitely helps.<br />- Four grams of fiber.  Not a huge amount, but again, most people don't hit their fiber target in a given day.<br />- Contains a lot of organic ingredients and is vegan.  Some people may not care about this, but it's very important to others.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- High price.<br />- High sugar (22 grams)<br />- Strawberry flavor is not strong (and it's low on the list of ingredients). The primary ingredient is dates.<br /><br />Mixed feelings:<br />- Taste.  It's not the greatest tasting thing, but it's not bad either.  I don't picture myself ever craving one.  My vegan sister-in-law tried one and thought it was disgusting.<br />- Calories.  It contains 160, which is high or low depending on what your alternative is.  Is it healthier than eating a vending machine candy bar?  Of course.  But it's also higher than eating actual fruit, or a Fiber One bar (which is around 135 calories).",0
"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say ""lack of"" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste.",0
"I am the kind of person who reads the ingredients list of EVERYTHING. I did a little experiment. I didn't read the ingredients list until after I started using this product. I loved the feeling it gave my hair - nourished, just like the package promises. My scalp and hair felt great. I noticed the smell was pleasant even though I was sure it was a chemical fragrance. The ingredients are a real let down. The product definitely gives great results but I object to the long list of chemicals in this product. Most products have them.

"I don't hate whoppers, I just like all the other candy bars more. However Whoppers are the cheapest to make, so I can understand why they did it.

"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.

All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay",0
"1. The box is very small.<br />2. You can buy these for half the price at JellyBelly.com! Boy, did I feel ripped off when I discovered that!",0
"My dogs have been using these for nearly 4 years, and they love them.  They seem to reduce plaque to some degree.<br /><br />The gripe I have is, Virbac has made them smaller.  The medium chews are smaller than before, and the large chews are about the size that the mediums used to be.  The extra larges are smaller too.  I am not imagining this; I have a bag from about 6 months ago and the new ones are considerably smaller.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind, if they had reduced the price...but they didn't.<br /><br />Conclusion:  smaller product for same price",0

"Our dog loves this food, but this seller keeps shipping me damaged goods. In each shipment we get at least one or two severely dented cans. This is not due to shipping. The box it's shipped in arrives without a dent. It's only inside, therefore, the dents are happening before they ship.",0
"Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying.",0
"If you like iced coffee, you will probably prefer to continue drinking your favorite iced brand.  While I found this a bit too strong, it does have a better, less bitter flavor than most canned coffees, and the metallic taste I often notice in canned coffees is very light here.  For the money, I would not purchase it in this manner.  It's rather expensive for the small sized cans.  For someone who just likes an occassional iced coffee treat at home, it may be a good choice.",0
Worked OK but these Stakes catch only a few of the irritating critters and certainly won't eliminate them. We ended up throwing away our few houseplants and starting over with new ones.,0

"Our Bulldog, who destroys everything but the Kong, had the treat out and 3/4 of the way eaten within an hour.  It's a shame... I was really hoping this would keep her occupied for a while.

"I travel a lot and tend to often buy bottled water as I go through airports and gas stations.  I've had enough different types that I know what flavors I like and what flavors I don't like.  I like spring waters like Fiji and purified municipal water like Dasani, so I am not that particular.  Water that has gone through reverse osmosis is about the purest water you can get, but many do not like the flavor because the same purification process that removes chemicals also removes minerals that give water its flavor.  Reverse osmosis water is often said to taste ""flat"", and some health gurus even claim it robs the bones of calcium, although these claims are dubious at best.<br /><br />Enter Essentia bottled water.  It claims that after the reverse osmosis, they add back in electrolytes to improve the flavor (listed on label, minerals like calcium carbonate).  In fact, it tastes like reverse osmosis water with some electrolytes added - still not as full and refreshing as spring water that is merely filtered, but definitely better than plain reverse osmosis water.  Afterwards, they add baking soda to raise the pH to 9.5, purpotedly because there are health benefits to drinking water with a high pH.  These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and the Mayo clinic website says there are no conclusive studies.<br /><br />Honestly, the flavor did not sit well with me or my wife, and the science backing up the amazing health claims is dubious at best.  It's not terrible, but nothing that special either.  I'm rating it 3 stars because while it is fine water, the taste just wasn't for me.  You can make up your own mind - if you want high pH water, then this would be a fine choice.  But if you just want fresh tasting water, there are less expensive and better tasting options in my opinion.",0
"I use them as soup croutons ot in a yogurt.<br />but after I realized (thanks to another reviewer) that they contain soy, I will not buy them anymore.",0
"Recommend putting less water. If you fill it to the line like noodles, it comes out like soup. The mixture isn't thickening enough.  So I would say put less water when cooking them.  The flavor was lacking a bit, but I think that's because I put the recommended amount of water. I think when I put less water it will be more flavorful (less diluted).",0
"These k-cups taste good and are great for a quick Chai fix. They're also a good coffee alternative, but they not good enough to replace my Starbucks stop for a Chai latte or an Apple Chai.",0
"I found this bar rather lacking in chocolate flavor.  At 54%, it might be possible that I am used to a higher cocoa content (60%+).  While some other reviewers have mentioned the mouthfeel as ""grainy"", I found it more chalky.  It melted well in the mouth without any grainy feel, but when chewed, became a rather gummy mass of chocolate.  It wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little strange.  If you don't like dark chocolate, you would probably enjoy this bar--it seemed more like semi-sweet chocolate to me.  If you like dark chocolate, however, prepare for disappointment.",0
"Didn't like the flavour that much, I thought it was going to be sweeter. Disappointed.",0
It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner,0
"Amazon.com has the wrong picture up for this item. It is not a blister pack Wintergreen Fusion (5 3-packs), it is just regular old Wintergreen (5 3-packs). Disappointed? Yes, as I was expecting something new, hence the 3 star rating. FIX IT.",0
"I was interested in what Starbucks would do with a lighter roast with vanilla flavor since I like some flavored coffees especially chocolate raspberry. However, I found this roast was still too dark and bitter for me.  I tried it black, with creamer alone and with creamer  and sugar together and disliked it thorougly in all cases. I made a pot and shared it with friends:  Several of my friends enjoyed it thouugh others wouldn't even try it.  Overall, if you like Starbucks typical dark  roast and like (sweet) vanilla coffee this is likely to be something you will enjoy.",0
"This machine makes some FINE-looking beverages, but it seems that the Nescafe food components are not living up to the fine Krups mechanics.<br /><br />This drink looks barista-quality, and the Krups machine does its job handsomely.  However, it tastes like instant coffee mixed with powdered milk.  Well, I guess that's sorta what it is....<br /><br />""Appearance over taste"" seems to be the theme here.",0
"I have been drinking oolong tea for a few years now. I am used to the darker kind of oolong with a richer taste. In comparison, this kind of tea seemed a little too light for me, almost like green tea. It does not seem as oxidized and with less strong taste as the kind of oolong I am used to drinking. If you are looking for a strong, rich tea, this is not for you. This is a light, delicate tea, like green tea, in my opinion. It has a nice taste, but it's just not strong enough for me. I give it three stars because it seems good quality, came in nice packaging, vacuum-packed for freshness, etc.",0
"Several cans I received were dented, three were so severely dented, I had to throw them out.  I work in food safety, so I know the possible dangers of dented cans.",0
This falls pretty short of what I had hoped for.  It has the slightest taste of watermelon I guess.  It really tastes like bubble gum.  Not recommended.  Jolly ranchers taste more watermelony.,0
"I was not as pleased as I have been in the past.  The product didn't taste as fresh and there were many pieces that had hard parts like popcorn that hasn't been ""popped"" correctly.  Oddly enough, they have raised the price but lowered the quality!",0
they are good but for the size you get im giving it a 3 start very high priced for the size of the bags but very yummy,0
"We all know that sardines are almost a perfect food, though they clearly are an acquired taste.  I happen to love brisling sardines and eat them regularly with European style whole grain bread for lunch with iced tea.  I'm 100% Norwegian, so perhaps I have fish oil in my blood.<br /><br />When I came upon this product I was very excited.  My local specialty grocer, Trader Joe's, recently discontinued offering King Oscar Cross Pack Extra Small Norwegian Brisling Sardines in olive oil and I was bereft, at least until I found these sardines from Crown Prince.  I immediately ordered two cases from Amazon.<br /><br />These are acceptable sardines but I have to say they are decidedly second class when compared with those offered by King Oscar.  Perhaps it is the fact Crown Prince sardines are ""wood smoked"" that dries them out, but that is my primary objection.  King Oscar sardines are bathed in olive oil, moist and succulent.  Yes, the Crown Prince product has olive oil in the bottom of the can but the sardines themselves remain dry.  I've even taken to storing the boxes upside down in the hope the olive oil will permeate the sardines.  Thus far, my efforts have failed.  Perhaps the problem is the sardines themselves are a bit bigger than those ""extra small"" sardines from King Oscar.<br /><br />Sadly, despite my communication with the producer and distributor, I've been unable to locate a vendor either locally or online who carry my preferred sardines in the distinctive black box.  I will eat the Crown Prince sardines, reminding myself of their excellent health benefits.  I may even buy more of them if I'm unable to discover someone selling King Oscar but I will sorely miss the joy of eating sardines!",0
"I tried this out, because I love mocha's and Chocolate in my coffee.  This is good, but I like a much bolder coffee.  Great if you want a dessert coffee, or love chocolate.  I will stick with my bolder blends however.",0
"My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.",0
"Quality is good. It's also rich, but flavor is closer to a dark-medium roast than the usual medium Colombian taste I want. In consequence, it also has a too bitter taste.",0
"Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are ""good"" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.",0
"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again.",0
"The first bite of this Planters chewy granola bar takes me back to my childhood and Payday candy bars.  Back then, I couldn't eat chocolate, so my treat choices were limited.  I grew to love the sweet saltiness of Payday, and this Planters product delivers an almost perfect rendition of that flavor, down to the chewy caramelized sweet coating.  The only thing missing is the nougat center, and 20 calories.<br /><br />Yes, this ""granola"" bar has a whopping 220 calories, 100 of them from fat.  A Payday bar has 240 calories, 120 from fat.<br /><br />Although, at 13 grams of sugar, Planters does deliver less sweet stuff than Payday at 21 grams, but the distinction is tiny.<br /><br />This bar tastes great, does hit the spot and keep me from getting hungry in the afternoon, but I think a candy bar with nuts would do the same thing - even better is a handful of almonds or other nuts without the added salt or sugars.<br /><br />Great tasting treat, but ""granola"" bar it's not!",0
"After using Almond Powder in Europe, I decided to try my luck with it in the US and couldn't find it anywhere. Finally I bumped into this and decided to try my luck. Personally I thought it still too coarse to be called a ""powder"".

"It's icing, hard icing, atop a crunchy, sugary, flat cookie ring. It comes in assortment of colours, but they all taste the same. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Reminds me of how a ginger bread man tastes, but without the ginger bit.",0
NICE SAMPLE OF VARIOUS COFFEES.  I FOUND I LIKED MOST OF THEM.  IT IS  A GOOD WAY TO FIND YOUR PERFECT FLAVOR. YOU GET ABOUT TWO OF EACH FLAVOR.  THEY SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED A COUPLE OF JAMAICA ME CRAZY.,0
"This product is certainly good for you, and doesn't really taste all that bad going down....but the after taste is awful. Somewhat like rinsing your mouth with rotted cardboard. It'll probably be OK in smoothie form with some fruit & yogurt, but all by itself in soy milk, I do not recommend it! It mixes OK, just a few grainy specks left. But the greenish color isn't appetizing. (again, add some fruit & yogurt, and I'm sure it'll be fine)",0

"Illy Issimo Cappuccino is a new drnk for me; a brand name I had not tried until recently but one I was anxious to sample. I like cappuccino beverages and I am a regular consumer of coffee, so this beverage sounded like something suitable to my tastes.<br /><br />This cappuccino drink is a little different from what I expected. Poured from the can into a glass, it looks like chilled hot chocolate with a mocha scent. It also contains a little less volume than I would prefer. The can is only 8.45 fluid ounces in size, so it is consumed completely in a very short time.<br /><br />As for the taste, it isn't as rich as I was expecting. I wanted something a little stronger and fuller bodied- something closer to an espresso. The taste of this drink, while certainly not bad, isn't very strong. It is chocolaty and coffee- like, as expected, with a creamy, medium to light body. It tends toward the sweet side, which is also not my preference. I drink all coffee- related beverages black, so I am not used to tasting sugar with my roasted brew. In addition, the sugar flavor in this beverage is different in taste and part of the reason is because the manufacturer uses beet sugar. This is probably healthier than refined sugar, but it does result in a little different flavor that may not suit the preferences of different drinkers.<br /><br />I like a good cappuccino and this one is really not a bad selection. A few tweaks of the recipe would make it a little better, but I agree that it is very easy drinking and has enough good taste to recommend.",0
Really great tasting chips. I really did not expect them to be as hard as they were. Good if they are cover with a cheese sauce.,0
i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip,0
"Nutro, Natural Choice Tartar Control Biscuit, 21 oz is not the product I thought it was going to be, I was looking for Nuto's chicken, brown rice Tartar control biscuit.

I didn't mind eating these chips but my kids were not fans of them...even my daughter who is not a picky eater.  Some were a bit tough.  We won't be buying these again.,0
"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again.",0
"I was trying to find the thick, syrupy stuff I bought a O and Co. The kind that drips out as thick as molasses. This isn't that stuff. Having said that, it's still pretty good. Would be great in salad dressing and price is decent. So it's not bad for what it is, but if you want the best of the best, molasses thick aged stuff, got to look elsewhere.",0
my dogs loves the taste but i am worried to the fact that its a hawhide,0
"The tea leaves are tiny, oxidized, and almost look like black-tea leaves. If you take a look at the leaves of a different brand of tea, you'll notice how tiny these leaves really are, and what a rip-off this is. The leaves are tiny, and the teabag is filled like a 10th of the way.<br /><br />I won't deny that it tastes good, but it's Lipton; We can all do better.<br /><br />Just buy some mangosteen *puree* if you want the health benefits. And try a different brand of tea, if you want your antioxidants.",0
"In marketing terms, I'm not certain what ""classique supreme"" is supposed to mean -- if anything. Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid-range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as ""classique"" or as ""supreme"" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day-to-day option for coffee fans.",0
"This is not the best turkey jerky I have had, but for the price is is worth it and I may re-order. This company also sells beef jerky, which is way too sweet and poor quality and processed. The turkey jerky is not nearly as bad as the beef. It has thicker pieces and is not as sweet. Because the price for this turkey jerky is pretty low, it makes it worth it, but it could be improved by being less sweet. It's not as bad as he beef, but still too sweet. Texture and meat quality were good, but not excellent.",0
"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor.",0
This same product is way too expensive. I buy it at my local Oriental Market for only $5. Otherwise it is a good tea for everyday use. Not the best matcha but decent especially if your only paying $5. You can get higher quality matcha for $13 than this product.,0

If you sign up for their mail notifications (join their coffee club.) you'll get 10 to 15 percent off.  They ship rather quickly.  But, if you want this tea for winter, you better order quickly because it tends to sell out around Christmas time or Thanksgiving.  I like the Mandarin Spice, and the Lemon Zinger.  All together, for 4 packages of tea (48 kcups of Mandarin, and 48 kcups of Lemon Zinger, my total was [...]  My only problem with the Kuerig site is that it is not too user friendly.

I bought these bars thinking they would be soft and chewy but they are more on the hard end. I would rather eat a power bar than eat these again. Im a really big health nut but some thing about these just doesnt taste right. Maybe I got a bad batch but if your looking for a snack these are a hit or miss. Overall I wouldnt buy them again unless I knew my batch was bad / old then I would want to try them again.,0

"I'm not sure why, but I had high hopes for this matcha. The price is wonderful, but the label on the box says it is a ""Product of USA"". Now, I have nothing against American-made goods, but matcha is something that has a history in Japan, and it's there that it has been perfected.<br /><br />I guess I should have been able to tell from the price that something was amiss, but I just held out hope that the fact that this product is culinary grade was explanation for the price.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad, it's just that it takes about 3 times as much matcha powder than normal to make my lattes. Once I add all the extra in, it's tasty. But if I use that much, then I might as well use the more expensive, authentic powder from Habiki-an.",0
The product seemed larger in the advertisement than what I received. i would not have purchased for the price quoted I prefer one that is larger.,0

"This tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container. It's strong not in a normal strong tea way. Instead it's bitter. If you use a Keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the Keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer. Also note that while it's in smaller print, there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to.",0
"It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!",0
"This is good coffee, but it is not what I would consider a deep dark roast.  Even with close to twice the usual amount, the flavor is not robust.  I'm not unhappy that I have it though, because it is organic at a great price.  It is not bad, just not as dark as I prefer.",0

"I love the product, but I think that it is a bit too pricey. The cans are barely over half full so we go through them very quickly. Like I said, I love the actual cereal, but if it wasn't the only cereal my baby could eat I wouldn't buy it because of the price.",0
"I bought this fudge expecting a more creamy fudge.  I was disappointed.  It has a strange undercooked grainy texture that I didn't like.  My canister was mainly rum raisin and that was my least liked flavor, it is made with real rum and I do not consume alcohol.  The ginger tasted odd and the strawberry didn't have any strawberry flavor.  I did like the Clotted cream it was very good, but only 2 in the pack.  I would not buy it again.",0
"The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol",0
"A while back, I ordered this product, and when it arrived I found that the coffee was a ""Light"" blend. The coffee was good, however, I prefer a medium blend coffee. This time when I ordered, I checked the listings closely, and noted that this coffee was listed as  ""Medium"". To make a long story shorter, the coffee arived, and it is a ""Light"" blend again. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice and shame on you. I will not reorder it again.",0
"The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.

"This product is obviously trying to be a tastier and better version of the typical energy drink.  With 81mg of caffeine, it will definitely give you a boost.  But it seems many drinks like this are either chock full of chemicals or are highly caloric.

For those of you on Weight Watchers, it is 3 PointsPlus points.  The product is distributed by cCca-Cola, but is made in Denmark.<br /><br />Upon opening the can and taking a sip, I was surprised by how thin and watery the drink tasted.  It didn't taste bad, but not was not particularly flavorful or good either.  Perhaps this is because it is only lightly sweetened and has low fat, but there was just no body or interesting flavor to the drink.  I think it's just not good coffee.  It just tasted flat and lifeless.  I've sipped cold Starbucks left in my car for a few hours before and quite enjoyed it - this was nothing near that.<br /><br />All of that being said, competing products such as Starbucks bottled Frappucino has almost twice the calories, fat, and significantly more carbs.  Possibly this is why they taste better, but as I said before, I think the coffee they use in this drink is also not high quality.<br /><br />So for a light chilled coffee beverage, it's not a terrible choice, but not a particularly interesting or tasty one either.  I might buy it in the future, but it won't be a regular drink for me.",0
I love earths best and was excited to see this variety pack on amazon. We were doing the subscribe option but had to stop as this pack contains to much orange!I know it sounds strange but i like my dd to get a bot of variety and with only one green option the oranges (winter squash and sweet potato) were staking up and not being used....I would say good to order every once in a while but not enough variety to subscribe to.,0
"This is undoubtedly a nutritious rice. No matter how I ""doctor"" this rice, I really don't care for the taste. I bought it because I really enjoy the other whole grain blends. I like most other Rice a Roni brands. Please check out the ingredients before you purchase. It is an odd mixture for my taste buds. It is not a ""classical"" test at all.Nor is it representative of any chicken and herb I have tried.",0
"The cans are teeny tiny, and for what they charge it's just not worth the expense. Also, I really hate how they charge different prices for different flavors. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. The product itself is yummy, just not happy about the prices.",0
"the smell of this tea before preparing was better than actually tasting it. I seriously thought about using the bags as potpourri but promptly  recycled by giving it to a friend who drinks nothing but chai. I gave 3 stars for the packaging and the good ol, Made in the USA.",0
"I loved the way it absorbed & soaked up the cat urine, leaving a piney scent. but the cats loathed both the smell of pine & the hard goatfood-pellate shape on their dainty feet. Perhaps if they would grind it into something finer. Some of the pieces even get lodged between their little toes.<br /><br />The other problem is the tiny amount you get & how much it costs. I have a lot of kittens & a lot of litter boxes to clean several times a day.",0

"I really can not rate the dog food as I just received it an hour ago but out of 24 cans 11 were dented so bad that I can not use them for fear of botulism, 2 were seeping dog food. They were not damaged in shipping as the box was not damaged. Called Amazon and their customer service is excellent and sending me replacement order. Hope the dog food is as good as most reviewers say.",0
"My cat usually can't get enough of his daily wet food, but he won't eat this stuff.  He completely licks all the sauce off and leaves the entire bulk of the food.  Every, damn, time.  He's not picky with any other wet canned food, only this.",0
"I should start out by mentioning that we typically love Earth's Best products.  The baby food is a staple in our house.  Recently, we tried the ""Snackin' Fruit Hearts"" for our 11 month old daughter.  She loves them.  Over a couple weeks she has eaten half of the 1.4oz container.<br />Today I tossed the remainder.  Our daughter has choked on this finger food product on three occasions during this half container, twice requiring life-saving actions.  To date our, daughter has not choked on any other food of any kind other than an occasional cough while drinking milk, but these have been very minor events compared to the choking incidences involving the ""Snackin' Fruit Hearts"".  As I mentioned she is a walking 11 months old toddler, has 8 teeth for biting and crunching, and has no problem with other similar or dissimilar foods, so I am hesitant to think that she is just having difficulties with eating this type of food.  I don't know why this particular product is problematic and poses a such a risk to her.  I also don't know to what degree this is rare or not with this product.  I also sent this review to Earth's Best not to rant or even complain, but simply to make them aware of our history with this product so that they will be informed to possibly make adjustments to the product or consider a warning label or statements on the product instructing a minimum age (over 1yr?) or at least *constant supervision* (no statement currently on the packing mentioning age or chocking hazard/supervision).  The world is dangerous enough for little ones, it seems food shouldn't be a risk to a young life.",0
Was disappointed in the flavor. Fairly bland. No problem with the K cups themselves. Just the flavor<br />could be improved.,0
"I thought I would give these jelly beans a try after seeing numerous ads in my running/health magazines.  I thought, hey I love jelly beans why not give it a go.  I have used cliff shots, GU, power bars, almost every kind of endurance treats out there.  This was my latest trial.  They were not the best but they were not terrible.  I did notice a bit of a late run boost, but the taste is medicore at best.  I thought I was trying to swallow vitamins.  If taken without water beware of a gagging sensation.  However, I have a very sensitive stomach and low tolerance when I am distance running, so that might be the reason.  If you think they will taste like jelly beans beware, they do not.  I would just stick to the old reliable jelly belly jelly beans if you are looking for a tasty on the go treat.",0
I bought this coffee b/c I liked the sound of the flavor - vanilla caramel and the fact that it was organic. But I found the flavor not as good as other brands I've had. I wouldn't buy it again.,0
I've only used it once. It seems to do as it says but I can't tell considering this summer heat and sweating so much.<br /><br />1 thumb up,0
"THIS Box is big. Compared to your normal box at walmart, This is like massive when you think about it.<br />I brought it for me and my mom, so I could practice cooking. But after cooking the second box making, it's like eating the same food for a month. It's best to just buy ONE from another seller. Cause it can and will get boring fast.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong ~<br />I love shells & cheese, but sometimes.<br />The calories, and the.. fat-grams..

"This is a shelf-stable palak paneer that you just rip open the foil pouch and microwave or warm on a stove-top.  My case of six came with a ""best use by"" date in less than a month, but I doubt that would make any difference.  It is OK - it has a decent amount of spinach, the paneer (cheese cubes) are not too soft or too rubbery, but it is a little oily (which may be because it's manufactured and then able to sit in a pouch on a shelf for a couple years).  There is no comparison to fresh made or even the varieties sold in retail freezer sections.  It's not bad, just not great.  3 out of 5 stars.",0
"I got these thinking they'd be a great healthy snack to take to work for in between meals. While they taste great, they're not healthy. They're kind of a cross between a cookie and a cracker. They taste really good - not too sweet, and the blueberry flavor doesn't taste fake. Taste-wise, these get a 5 all day long.<br /><br />Inside the package is one of those trays like Chips Ahoy come in. It would be easy to eat a whole row of these (maybe 15-20 thins). But if you did that, you'd be eating 933 calories and 33 grams of fat! A serving size is just 3 thins, and even though they are kind of big, they're still...well thin. So 3 thins might work as a dessert if you pre-ration them, but otherwise I think you're always going to want more than 3 to be satisfied.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is 'uncbleached enriched flour,' and 'whole grain wheat flour' doesn't make an appearance until about halfway down the list. It does have soy in it, and the fruit flavor seems to come only from dried blueberries and no weird stuff. The ingredient list is pretty short, which is nice. Nutriton-wise, it only has 2g of dietary fiber and nothing really notable for vitamins. I'm a bit disappointed. You'd think something called 'newton fruit thins' would have some redeeming nutrional quality, but these don't. It wouldn't be hard to make them a more healthy snack, and I wish Nabisco had done that.<br /><br />Despite how good they taste, the serving size/calories/fat issue makes them not a good buy for me, because they're just not a healthy snack. They're junk food disguised as a healthy snack, which might even be worse than plain old junk food.",0
"I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.",0

"These seaweed snacks are prepared well and packaging is great. You just have to LIKE seaweed and wasabi in a paper-thin crispy/flakey form.

"UPDATE:<br />I achieved a slightly improved result by using less coffee (fewer grounds).  Some of the bitterness was coming from making it too strong.<br /><br />So, 3.5 Stars now.<br /><br />Still feel the beans are not quite as fresh as my previous order (Guatemala , Organic Fair Trade Huehuetenango)<br />=================================================================================================================================<br /><br />My only other Coffee Bean Direct experience was good...with Guatemala , Organic Fair Trade Huehuetenango.  It has been excellent.<br /><br />This recent purchase of Sumatra Gayoland has been disappointing.<br /><br />Not much aroma.  Beans are a bit over-roasted.  Not much oil on the bean.<br /><br />As a result it tastes burned/bitter, stale and one-dimensional.<br /><br />I won't purchase again (even though good value) because quality and consistency is primary importance to me.  I can't be disappointed every morning by a mediocre cup of coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I use a French press and properly grind just before putting into perfectly heated water.  Brew for 4 minutes using timer.  Very particular.",0

"I first bought this brand of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine. Wish that they weren't so overpowering, so that I could snack on them right out of the container.",0
"I love this peanut brittle.  See's stores open up in the local shopping mall around the holidays, but I needed a fix.  The product arrived quickly and the boxes were in good shape.  Unfortunately, the chocolate had melted a little bit.  This made a big mess when I opened each one.  Don't worry, I still ate them all!",0
"The Coffe Bean English Breakfast tea in bags taste better: smoky, strong and smooth. The loose leaf tea seems to have more Assam and I cannot taste chinese tea",0
"I have always been a big fan of the sour cream and onion pringles, and I was looking for a bulk purchase. I decided since I make a lot of other purchases on Amazon that these would be fine too. I did expect some breakage, but I also expected them to reasonably try to package them to help prevent breakage. When I got the box, they had put one set of bubble wrap on the top of the case of chips, but somehow decided that not putting anything under them would be fine. Needless to say most of the chips are broken. I still ate them as little pieces, but I was pretty disappointed that they didn't bubble wrap them all the way around as most people would think to do.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars just because I like the chips. Shipping gets no stars in my book.<br /><br />I won't be ordering these again.",0
"I am a chocolate expert, and expected more of this chocolate than I got. It was poorly stored, so the chocolate is brittle and the cocoa butter has risen to the surface, so it's no good for nibbling, but when you melt it, i.e. for baking, it is much better. All low notes (no fruit or floral notes) makes for a chocolate that you should not use by itself in baking, it just doesn't have enough complexity. But mixed with other chocolates it will provide solid support.",0
The first one you eat tastes pretty good. But I got tired of them pretty quickly. Too gooey and sugary. And probably very bad for teeth. I prefer Lara Bars.,0
"Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters; miraculously, the chips survived relatively intact. Hopefully will continue to be so lucky in the future.",0

"Good price but this stuff is just too sweet for my liking. 80 calories a cup, 9 carbs, too much fat and sugar. The taste was good though so if you treat it more like a desert instead of an everyday morning coffee then you'll probably like it.",0
"Opening this cute soda was... interesting. The marble advertised is actually used as a stopper. There's a plastic device you have to pop out to push the stopper into the soda. While very pretty, I would say it only tastes okay. Not as sweet as I thought it would be. I don't know how to get the marble out of the glass, or even if you're supposed to.",0
"I'm not sure whether it's the fact that it came straight from Taiwan weeks after I ordered it (something I did not realize), but these were so light and airy in taste that I could barely pick up the chocolate cookie and cream flavor. It was really...REALLY light. Still, it wasn't all bad so I can't give it a bad review. It's just not the flavor for me. Bought it on a whim of curiosity, probably won't get it again.",0
"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.",0
"Everyone is right!! Wish the company would go back to the canister, really enjoy the coffee. Package is hard to open, too small an amount, have to drink 1/2 a cup or use 2 packs. 20 packs don't last long so you have to store 8 boxes in order to have a supply. Gave it 3 stars because of the package style, the coffee is 5 star. I'm sure the company won't listen to the consumer report and go back to the canister because they're making a lot more money this way.",0
"I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.",0
"I've tried both versions of Pistachio Jell-O (with and without sugar). I understand eating the sugar-free version for health reasons, but it's sadly lacking, and not just because of the lack of sweetness.<br /><br />The regular version:<br />-Is thicker (more like a custard)<br />-Has a stronger pistachio flavor<br />-Has more actual pistachio bits (the sugar-free version has maybe 1/4 as many)<br /><br />Either way, pudding is a great comfort food if you're looking for a tasty snack.",0
"I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local ""healthy supermarket,"" and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.",0
"I thought these cookies had a lot of flavor (a touch on the sweet side) for a vegan/gluten free treat - they were very gingery in a good way.  However, when I opened the package, the chocolate had obviously melted and re-solidified during shipping so the cookies were stick together and chocolate was all over.  This made them difficult to eat, and the cookies were more soft then I think they should have been.  I like my ginger snaps crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - these had no crispness at all, which would be fine if you like soft cookies but along with the melted chocolate, they were just too soft and messy.  These would be a great product if the manufacturer made some improvements to the chocolate and packaging. I didn't feel like I was eating something gluten free, though, so they at least got the flavor right!",0
"This is okay.  You have to use more than is actually called for to get a good flavor and the ingredient list isn't anything to rave about, but in a pinch it's okay.  My main issue is the taste isn't worthy the high calories in the least.  The coffee flavor is also pretty nonexistent.",0
"Dogs like whats on them, after that it seems they are just another chew after they lick all the good stuff off of it. These run large in size ie;medium size if you have a Lab. Next time I get these for my amer.cocker and bos. terrier they will be small chews. One more thing,,,you will either like the smell of these or you wont, I like it and my wife hates it.",0
"The concept is terrific and I loved the ability to layer different flavors to keep the dogs interested.  I ended up kicking the toy around in order to get their attention and they only ate what fell out.  My darling idiots aren't able to put the concept of their effort resulting in treats by nosing or pawing the toy around.  The device would probably work well for smarter dogs, however, my dogs are just stupid.  One more toy they don't understand.  I give up.  Oh well, my dogs entertain themselves by digging holes, breaking into the trash can and being loveable idiots. I KNOW there is a toy or two out there that matches their very low IQ and curiosity so I will continue to search.  Good luck to all of you with more advanced IQ dogs.",0
I had this tea in England this summer and wanted to order some because I found it to have an excellent flavour. Strong and malty. The tea that I ordered here was very slow in arriving; a month in the mail. When it arrived I found it to be slightly stale and not as strong as what I had in England. I don't know if the North American version is different but this isn't how I remembered it. Still not a bad flavour but not great either.  I won't order it a second time.,0
"My two packages, received today January 7 2012, both have a February 2012 expiry date. That's not OK. I contacted amazon.com via on-line chat and was offered a $10 partial refund, which I found fair, but I cancelled my subscription. Now I'll have to find another source for this excellent rice.",0
"The fruition bars, like most ""superfood"" bars, are not the most tasty things to eat. This being said, they are definitely moister than many. In fact, they almost seem like shaped goo/paste (which makes sense considering the main ingredient). It's almost as if they are uncooked (which they very well may be).<br /><br />Taste aside, the bars are definitely filling and do not make me gag in the same way that other, more drier/powederier  bars do. I will definitely be eating the rest of the box, but once they're gone, I think I'll choose something else, especially considering the $2.00+ per unit price.",0
"Kool Aid's been around for 85 years and most folks have tried it at some time so I'm reviewing the flavor not the idea that it is Kool Aid versus other drink choices. The flavor is called peach mango but it is the mango that dominates the drink. As a family who loves peaches and likes mango, it seemed like a good fit but it really should be called Mango with a hint of Peach.  So, if you love mango-flavored foods and drinks you'll enjoy this. If you are looking for the peach flavor to be equal (or more because it is first in the title)to the mango then you'll be disappointed.  Also, using the directed amount exactly made the flavor taste a bit ""thin""; adding a couple of teaspoons to the directed amount improved the richness of the flavor but didn't change it from mango to more of a peach-mango pair.",0
"Different flavor - not sure if want to acquire a taste for this, and would have to work at it.",0
"Crackers are okay, had been broken into small pieces. Not discounted enough to compensate for the breakage. Would not buy again.",0
"I like the crunchy-ness of the middle, but it doesn't have a great flavor, basically just a very sweet taste without much substance. The chocolate around it is pretty sweet too. If you like really sweet candy and crunchy-ness then go ahead and get them, but there are much better chocolates out there.",0
This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.,0
"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.",0
"I normally love this product - 5 stars - but in this shipment the bars were all hard like a rock. I wonder if it had been stored improperly prior to shipment. Still tasted great, but not the soft like the KIND bars I buy in the store.",0
"I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, ""hey that happens, no big deal..."" A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, ""hey that happens, it's hot out..."" But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, ""hey these are really salty"" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.",0

The Gamesa Emperador cookies took a while to transit to me in PA from the shipping location in GA. A few cookies were damaged in transit but overall most were in okay condition.

"The best apple juice products are processed directly from harvest. This stuff is reconstituted from concentrate with pureed skins apparently mixed in, but the result is watery and lacks fresh apple juice richness of taste. You can't tell this from the bottles which are heavily tinted, but poured into a glass it is pale and lacks body, even after vigorous shaking. Not looking forward to going through 8 gallons, wish I had bought just one at the store first.",0
"I made a New Year's resolution, this year, to not drink any pop. I'm about three months in, and have had no failings up to this point. I drink lots of water, and good old H2O is just about perfect. Still, there are some times I want a little more flavor, so I reach for the juice or some Crystal Light packets (the ones that are sized for water bottles). This Vitamin Squeeze product gives me another drink choice that is on the healthy side of the equation.<br /><br />The drink, itself, tastes quite a bit like Crystal Light drinks. So, if you enjoy those, you should enjoy this product as well. The price tag on this product is kind of high, but you do get (supposedly) 24 servings out of this squeeze bottle, as it only takes one squeeze to make a single serving. I have my doubts that it will stretch that far, but we'll see. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I found this product to be fine. It's nothing fantastic, but I wasn't disappointed with it, either. If you're into these sorts of beverage options, you'll probably like it. If you are more into pop or other carbonated beverages, you probably won't like it so much.",0
"My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.

"For years I've been buying pumpkin flavored coffee beans every fall from the coffee shop in my local Borders. Its a flavor I look forward to every year! Well, Borders closed, but we just got our Keurig machine so I was excited to try the pumpkin spice flavor from Green Mountain.  The flavor is disappointing to this pumpkin fan, though.  It is very heavy on the spice; the pumpkin flavor is negligible. I would call it cinnamon coffee rather than pumpkin spice coffee.",0
"A blind taste test was conducted among three members of the family ranging from 8 to 49 years of age. We used Poland Spring bottled water and Essentia 9.5 ph water, both cooled to identical temperatures. No family member was able to tell the difference in taste. Comments ranged from, ""It's water, right?"" to ""Did you put the same thing in both glasses?"" So...it looks and tastes like water.<br /><br />We next tested the pH using materials drawn from a 40 year old Gilbert Chemistry set. Remarkably, the Essentia water was, in fact, between pH 9 and 10, quite a bit more alkaline than the Poland Spring or tap water, both of which proved to be neutral in pH. A phenolpthalein solution turned pink when mixed with Essentia water but remained clear with both the Poland Spring and tap water.<br /><br />A MedLine search did not reveal any evidence for studies that have definitively identified health benefits of alkaline water. One study indicated that patients with metabolic acidosis due to renal failure may benefit from alkaline water, but human studies are still necessary to demonstrate any real value.<br /><br />Some individuals may enjoy using this water to mix with concentrated orange juice for a low-acid product. Drinking it alongside a high-acid meal such as a meal containing tomato sauce may reduce heartburn/reflux. Your mileage may vary. Otherwise, I'd be concerned about the potential negative impact of drinking large quantities of alkaline pH water without neutralizing it in advance. I don't see that any long term studies have been conducted to demonstrate safety of high volume intake of alkaline water.<br /><br />But for occasional use, this tastes just like any other bottled water.",0
"I am a huge spicy food fan!  I put hot sauce on just about everything and have tried probably a hundred different sauces.  While this one is good, I find it a bit boring compared to others.  It does add a little kick but the flavor is lacking.  There are a lot of sauces that add pure heat but either the heat is overwhelming or the flavor is completely lacking.  My number one favorite hot sauce is:<br /><br />Yucatan Sunshine Habanero Pepper Sauce - [..]<br /><br />It's about as spicy but the flavor is fantastic!  I put it on Mexican food, pasta, etc.  I always have a few bottles of this around and give them away to friends pretty regularly.",0
"The snow cone syrup did taste pretty good. Small container (16 ounces) does not go very far. Was $5.00 for 16 ounces. We found a place called The Corn Popper in Tulsa, Ok. That has quarts (32 ounces) for $3.95 and gallons (128 ounces) for $9.95. They make something like 70 flavors of the best snow cone syrup you ever tasted! Really flavorful and no high fructose corn syrup. Made with pure cane sugar.<br />I believe they have a web site. It is a good idea to refridgerate your syrup as it will stay good longer but also will make it thicker to stay up on the ice and being cold it won""t melt the ice as much.",0
"Unfortunatly my cat would not eat it, and he is not that picky. I gave almost all the cans to a friends of mine who has 3 cats, she said they would not eat it either. Bad batch? I do not know.... Would not buy it again....",0
"the salt is wet and i dont like that. it's not dripping or anything, but it's moist and it is clumping. i had to put it in the oven and as i type it's baking to get the moisture out.<br /><br />i did not know that it would be damp.<br /><br />it has a nice flavor, quite salty. if it was not damp/wet, i'd buy it again.",0
"I am a subscribe and save customer for the regular size black tea bags as well as the 20 count superfruit blends, so I bought this before doing my homework.  I just happened to visit my nearest warehouse club and spotted this tea for $8.77, nearly half what Amazon is charging.  Anyone who thinks this is a bargain is living a sheltered life.  I am cancelling my subscribe and save for this item.",0
"The ingredients have not been updated in the description, and are no longer accurate.<br />The ""New Formula!"" is actually a cheaper formula.  Nutiva has replaced the Organic Fair Trade Certified Chocolate with ""organic chocolate flavor"".<br />I'm not sure what ""organic chocolate flavor"" actually is, so I now make my own mix by combining <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012C2GFM"">Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Hi Fiber, 3 Pound Bag</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0Y2"">Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder, Mayan Superfood, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a> and a little organic cane sugar.",0
"I stopped buying Beef Jerky to avoid the preservatives, Nitrates/Nitrites etc.  Thinking I found one without, I purchased this product after reading the words ""all natural"" in the product description.  Now that it has arrived, I found Sodium nitrite is listed on the package. Also, I might mention that after the blurb about the ""Texas Rancher"" looking for something better, I wasn't expecting the advisory on the bag that the Beef was not only sourced in the USA, but in Uruguay, New Zealand or Austrailia. Oh well, a guy can dream.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes.",0
"O.k., this is just weird.  It's green tea with aloe vera pieces in the tea.  (Not pureed passion fruit, not essence of passion fruit, just aloe vera pieces.)<br /><br />When I first started drinking it I thought I'd gotten a contaminated bottle.  This is one of the strangest things I've ever had to drink. It tastes good, but I can't get past the fact that every mouthful reminds me of chewing small fish in water.  No.",0
"We ordered the Almond Apricot, Almond Coconut, and the Mango Macadamia.<br />We actually liked them in the order listed.<br />I think we will only order Almond Apricot again.<br />They were good!<br /> The Mango's had bit of a after bite. Husband only liked the almond apricot.",0
will not buy thru mail again.  Bags were open.  Perhaps bubble wrap would help. Great product will purchase again.  Shipping quality is poor.,0
"It is true that this water has a smooth, slick taste and mouth feel as I drink it, but there is also a slightly  bitter aftertaste that I don't like. I also miss the crisp, clean taste of my current spring water. Drinking this water is almost like drinking air. It is just strange. I understand that the main focus of this water is the effects of alkaline pH on performance and wellness, but I would need to drink this product over a longer period of time to evaluate any personal differences I might experience.<br /><br />Health benefits are so individualized that basically one has to try a product for themselves to evaluate the outcome. The product is priced right. Unfortunately, the mouth feel and strange aftertaste will prevent me from doing that.",0
"The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!",0
"This popcorn is OK, not great.  Works fine in my air popper, but it's a little ""chewy""... don't know if that means it's been sitting around a while or what.  Again - not horrible, but not the best popcorn I've ever had.",0
"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery,<br />Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size",0
"After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!",0
i was looking forward to this popcorn. it was so so... it smells delicious when it's cooking. and some pieces (the ones with more flavor on them) are good but in general not sure if i would buy this again. but it is a nice change from the regular butter flavor and it's nice that it is a healthy pop flavor.,0
"This isn't the greatest Progresso soup I've had. It does have a huge amount of solid ingredients in it, which is great. Unfortunately the broth and the flavor are not as strong as I would have liked given the fact that it's supposed to be ""roasted chicken with garlic."" The garlic is what I was really hoping for, but it wasn't a very discernible flavor in my bowl. As you can see from the photo on the can and the photo I uploaded, this soup comes with chicken, penne, green beans, corn, tomato, and carrots. The vegetables did come out a little on the mushy side when I had it, microwaved at 3 minutes in a 1000-watt unit (the directions recommend 2-4 minutes), while the penne was just a little firm but in better shape than the veggies. The chicken doesn't look incredibly appetizing (it looks like it's been sitting in some broth in a can, frankly), but it tasted fine and the texture was normal. Overall it was a decent-tasting soup and it did its job of filling me up; you gotta love Progresso and the ridiculous amount of food they can fit into these cans. The broth did leave an unpleasantly-firm ring of color around the bowl as I continued eating. Nothing that wasn't easy to wash off, but just...you know...that's what you're eating, is all.<br /><br />Not a bad soup, but not a great one. You could do better with Progresso than this one.",0
"I love this brand for my Little One. Problem is, I'm not always at the grocery store and the price is way more than what Walmart wants for the same product. Amazon, if you want to compete with other retail, make the prices lower than other retail, not more. You'll lose customers that way. Besides, it was $32.88. Why was it raised to $34.99? Ridiculous.",0
"These taste just like any other packaged pork rind product I've tried. I was hoping these would be fresher, closer to the real thing I buy in Mexican markets. Oh well, for a quick snack when you don't feel like leaving the house, it's fine.",0
"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.",0
I expected it to be somewhat stronger.  It is good but requires two pods for a decent cup.  That bounces the price up to $0.44/cup.,0
"A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says ""gluten-free"" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten.",0
"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right.",0
"I was hoping that this Vanilla Almond would be even better than the Bigelow version I originally fell in love with, but has since been discontinued. I found the Republic of Tea version to be similar in flavor, but much weaker. I've experimented with using less water, letting it steep for longer, and even using two bags per cup, but it's just not as strong as I would like it to be. It's still nice though, and I will certainly use the rest of the canister...but probably not purchase it again.",0
"A couple years ago my dentists told me that tap water was rotting my teeth.  So it was time to make change.  Usually I just drink from the filter I attached to my kitchen faucet since bottled water is not good for the environment and sometimes bottled water manufacturers have been found to just put tap water in their bottles.  Essentia hypes ""silky smooth taste"" ""hydrates better"" ""electrolytes infused"" and ""Best available pH at 9.5"".  Okay, the last two sound like marketing mumbo jumbo.  It does have silky smooth taste, but really all water I have drank aside from unfiltered well or city water has silky smooth taste.  It does have a slight weird taste to it.  Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.  Essentia will not get me to change from tap water, but if you only drink bottled water you may want to give it a try, it is a bigger bottle which makes it slightly better for the environment than the smaller bottles (but not s good as just buying a filter).",0
My dog likes to swallow most things whole. Unfortunately these breath mints are small enough that they disappear down the hatch without a single chew. I think they would work...if only he would chew. :),0
"Why my dog loves these, I will never know.  They arrived in a timely manner but were not packed in a smell friendly bag.  When opened the envelope I was almost knocked over by the stench.  Plus, although they were very long and med thickness (not as thick as they suggest) he ate it in less than ten minutes.  I will probably get them again for him since his teeth are really sparkling.",0
"I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.",0
"I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.",0
"We have 7 dogs. 6 of them wouldn't eat this, the 7th acted like it was the best thing ever.<br /><br />the treats themselves look nice enough, small squares, sort of like cookies. bite sized for most dogs and didn't have any colors in them to run on the carpet or anything like that. So its really all about whether or not your dog likes lamb and barley. Hope that helps you",0
"If you like flavored coffee this coffee passes the test, not the best I have had, but good in a pinch.",0
"It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the ""tea-bagging"" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a ""coffee-flavored water"" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.",0
"My parents bought two of these trays as a Christmas gift for me since I make much of our daughter's baby food.<br /><br />Pros:<br />~ Easy to fill<br />~ Easy to pop cubes out<br /><br />Cons:<br />~ Awkward, bulky shape<br />~ Large cube size (our mostly-breastfed 7 month old eats at most 1.5-2 oz of food right now)<br />~ Extremely overpriced compared to alternatives<br /><br />I purchased the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I868DY"">Annabel Karmel Freeze Cube Tray</a> and not only is it just as easy to use as the Beaba freezer trays, but the cubes are a bit smaller and the tray itself is more compact.  It's also less than half the price, which to me is the most important aspect.  The Beaba trays work fine for their intended purpose but are extremely over-priced.",0
"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",0
"I recently bought a Sodastream Genesis for the purpose of creating my own club soda. It's a great machine. As an additional experiment, I've tried a few of the flavors from this sampler pack, and I've been rather disappointed with the results.<br /><br />Even the _non diet_ flavors are sweetened with Splenda, and the soda leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. If you're used to diet soda, you're likely to find these flavors quite delicious. However, if you're really sensitive to artificial sweeteners, you might want to pass on Sodastream's regular and diet flavorings. (Their website provides nutrition information on all of their flavors, so you can check to see what sweetener is used in each flavoring.)",0
"I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard.  I applied it as directed in paths of the critters.  I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations.  I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't.  My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were.  I think it was my imagination.  I have not had luck with any product.  Nothing more to say about this - it failed me.",0
"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",0
"At almost a dollar for one TINY can (the same exact size as a fancy feast) I would personally never buy this product; it just isn't worth it. I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food.",0
"Great food, was at a great price.  Guess we'll go back to innova instead. thanks for the 20% price increase amazon.. the local pet shop appreciates it.",0
"Although this was a good price and shipping was free, I'm not sure it was worth it. The bag arrived with a large tear. I had to fish all the loose pieces out of the box, and I have to wonder how long the bag was torn. Was this sitting in a warehouse somewhere in this condition losing freshness and nutrients? I'm not certain that it was torn during shipping. I have to say, it did arrive very quickly, and the use-by date was well into the next year. If not for the tear, I would have been very happy.",0
"This coffee tastes all right, but I can't taste any chocolate. I guess I was hoping for more of a mocha flavor.",0
"I heard about this on Dr. Oz - the ladies who did the taste test really seemed to enjoy it.<br />When I prepared this it smells a bit like weeds or grass, and the taste is not favorable.",0
"These look good, and while they are soft, they were not very flavorful.  My wife who really loves chocolate, gave these a B-, and would not buy them again.  Each cookie is sealed in a separate package, the package was easy to open, and each cookie is about 3 1/4 inches in diameter  -- a good size for a cookie, but huge, but not too small.  See the pictures above (I scanned in the Nutrition facts for these, and I've scanned in a picture of one cookie in it's package (6 cookies come in a box of these).",0

"I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.",0
"I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped.",0
"Think about this before you buy.  I didn't.  What you end up with is 48 tiny little cans of V-8; and, in effect, are buying a lot more container than juice.  When they say ""units"" in the copy, they are referring to 8 six-can packs, with each can containing about 5 oz., or in truth a couple of swallows of juice.<br /><br />That said, V-8 Low Sodium is a great product, healthy and tasty hot or cold.",0

I purchased this coffee for my teenage daughter in college.  She said it tasted OK but was weak compared to Starbucks.  She prefers a stronger coffee. It is really hard to tell the strenght of the coffe by the description.,0
I have been a fan of this product for a very long time and when I found out it was discontinued from the grocery store chains I started looking at discounted stores for it with no luck then came to Amazon with hopes of finding this product here. It is very expensive to order drinks when you go to a restaurant for a nice dinner so I like to order water and use my Crystal Light on the Go as it saves me money. I was very pleased to find it right here on Amazon and have ordered enough to last me for a very long time.,1
"We just got a new snorkie.  She was just picking at the food the previous owner had been feeding her.  We purchased Blue Lamb flavor for her and she went nuts over it.  My husband was as stunned as I was.  I don't know what it is about this stuff, but I have never seen this kind of reaction over dog food before.",1
"I love these. They are really handy to take to school, work, etc. They taste AMAZING. I like all the flavors in the variety box. They are really easy to take on vacations, etc. I would recommend these to anyone who loves a lot of flavor without sacrificing their health!",1
"This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended.",1
I have been looking to buy this online everywhere! I used to live in Baltimore and a nearby Indian store carried it but I moved way out to MO to a very small town that doesn't have an Indian store. I missed eating these and decided to look for them online. I absolutely LOVE these and am obsessed with them. They are delicious! and remind me of home. Thank you very much for offering these of amazon and they are well worth your money.,1
"I wanted HIGH QUALITY , and this is it. This brand was highly recommended .",1
"I like something sweet, that is portioned controlled and lasts for quite a while.  This is it!",1
"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)",1
This is certainly one of the best products from Gerber of all the ones I have used till now and I have used quite a few of them. My daughter is 10 months old and she totally loves it :) They dissolve easily in the mouth and thats the best thing about them. The flavours are also delicious! I totally recommed this product for every mom who wants to begin to teach their kid how to start having food by themselves.,1
im obsessed with these crackers!!! theyre so good and unlike any other cracker you ever tasted..u just gotta taste it so you could know...,1
"This is the most wonderful thing that I have ever used...My mother has been battling cancer for 10 years and this gives her the energy to get going and not feel sick from chemo....I have been using it and my psoriasis is clearing up!  This is just amazing stuff!!  I love it and everybody should try it, even if you don't think you have any problems and you don't need it...Just try a bottle!!!",1
I love Ahmad tea. The Earl Grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. The bergamot flavour isn't overpowering like some other brands I have tried.<br /><br />I will be buying more of this wonderful tea,1
"I love chocolate.  Good chocolate.  I've tried fancy bars, local bars, hand-poured bars, organic bars, and almost everything else, and THIS is my favorite.  The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!",1
This is a very well flavored curry.  The aroma is exceptional.  Add more or less to control spice intensity.  I usually add additional pepper sauce to spike the heat.,1
"Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!",1
"Light, sweet and oh so good is how I would describe this tea. I first had it at a hotel at the complimentary breakfast and loved it so much, I went to Amazon and ordered more that same day.",1
"several months ago i started eating oatmeal for breakfast to help control my diabetes. (it actually works. who knew?) i'm not a big fan of oatmeal, so i tried tossing some store bought dried cherries in it one day. it was better, but too sweet. >_&lt; the cherries tasted like gummy candy and did not fit the ""tart"" description on the package.<br /><br />however, i didn't want to give up! i went on amazon and asked for these cherries for christmas. and oh my word... not only are they an incredible value, they are INCREDIBLE cherries! they're tart, juicy, and fabulous just to snack on. i'm asking for more cherries for my birthday because they're so good! in fact, my mom wants to try them because i've raved about them so much. *^_^*<br /><br />i will order them again and again. great stuff!",1
"My family recently took a trip to Italy & we saw these giant containers of Nutella everywhere. My brother-in-law really wanted one but we had no way to get it home. We sent him this for his birthday & he's in Nutella heaven...even hosted a Nutella party! It is delicious & the Nutella from Italy actually tastes better than the Nutella we can get here in the states...don't know why though. It is so GOOD, don't know why its not more popular in the US cause its everywhere in Italy.",1
"My 11-month-old son loves these organic puffs. They've almost become a daily staple and they've been ultra useful whenever I need him to settle down when we're out in public. All I have to do is shake the container and I've got his attention. Powerful stuff! Lots of vitamins, with less sugar than the store brands. Apple and banana are both great.",1
"These OTC crackers are truly the best--  I grew up with them, but find them hard to find locally.  So glad I thought to check with Amazon!",1
"I have ordered this tea many times and have been happy every time. Arrives well boxed, in excellent condition and always as stated delivery. Less cost online than when it was available in my area; less cost than the actual product website. Each box is individually wrapped for freshness, then each bag is sealed in its own paper wrap. Never been disappointed in any order made for this tea and always happy with product received.",1
"I've been faithfully using Dove conditioner for, well, awhile, but I'm always interested in trying something new, so I had no problem with giving Clean Scalp & Hair Beauty a shot.<br /><br />O.M.G.<br /><br />This conditioner is seriously amazing. Firstly, it comes out nice and thick, which, to me, is always a sign of a quality conditioner. The conditioner smells amazing and I was really hoping that it would work as good as it smells.<br /><br />IT. DOES.<br /><br />It not only got my hair nice and almost completely tangle-free after my shower, it did the same for my 8 year old daughter, and anyone who has an 8 year old daughter with almost waist-length hair can definitely appreciate that!<br /><br />Sorry Dove - I think I'll be cheating on you!",1
We have been gluten free for 3 months now since our diagnosis and I have tried to make pancakes that tasted like what we ate before with no success. All others we tried had a horrible aftertaste. Once we tried Pamela's that was not the case! We will only buy Pamela's mixes now-they are like regular gluten filled mixes but probably better. If you are on the fence about getting this-just hit buy. You will not be disappointed!,1
"We love these!  We get the peanut butter variety.  They taste great and are wonderful for keeping in the car.  My kids know the serving size (which is 9 sandwiches) and also ask for the appropriate amount.  They are a great, healthy, quick snack and they work to keep the toddler quiet to boot!<br />The subscribe and save is by far the best deal I've seen.  And it just shows up at my door when I need more!  Gotta love it!",1
I like the cake better than the brownies.  Have taken them to several parties and no one has ever said they taste bad or different.  They are fluffy and delicious.  I don't care for the GF BC brownies. Will order cake mix again.,1
"This is one of my absolute favourite herbal tea blends, and I'm glad to be able to buy it in Australia. You can REALLY taste the catnip in this one and I have to have it in an airtight sealed container or my cat will get right into it.<br /><br />I don't really smell or taste cinnamon or giner personally, the siberian ginseng (Eleuthero) overwhelms most of the other flavours you'd expect this to taste of (lemon, ginger, cinnamon) and instead I find the aroma very grassy with slight lemon smell and the taste mostly chamomile and catnip.<br /><br />Overall I find this a lot nicer (read: less fruity/cloying) than most other blends on the market. I drink this sweetened with Stevia.",1
"I think this was the best purchase decision I made all year. When my kids were little I never let baked goods from the store in the house and every night ground flour to bake with but drifted away from that as they got older and flew the nest. After years of buying fairly adequate bread, crackers whatnot at the store I decided to go back to making my own.  I bought a Wondermill Jr. hand mill and based on previous reveiws here I ordered this Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Spring Wheat.<br /><br />The other reviewers were correct this is absolutely fabulous wheat. It has a very high gluten content and makes a very dark flavorful satisfying loaf.<br /><br />I would especially recommend this to anyone new to bread-making. I don't think you can make a bad load with this some good yeast and a bit of elbow grease.  I used the SAF Instant you can order buy the pound just like the big bakeries do. It's just plain good yeast.<br /><br />The best thing about this wheat is you can make each loaf for less than a dollar =))<br /><br />Oh...this wheat is not good for pie crusts pastry kind of things...the gluten content is too high and will make anything like that tough.  This is to make glorious bread.",1
"I'm not the biggest chicken fan, but a friend of mine, Chef Mike,<br />of West Creek, NJ ...barbecued chicken for the first time ...<br />Matter-of-fact, he cremated it and was about to throw all 6lbs.<br />out ...  Luckily, I took a bite before it hit the garbage bin.<br /><br />And From this point, I was addicted. Chef Mike made all the mistakes<br />that day of a beginning barbecue novice. He didn't marinate the chicken,<br />just slapped it on the chicken and threw it on the grill (low settings).<br />He turned the chicken 4 times. The skin was blackened ... charred ...<br />but the taste, at least to me, was addicting, out of this world.<br /><br />He made the same chicken for my visit last week the exact same way<br />because I raved about his recipe (remember, I'm not a big chicken eater)<br /> .... Again ... Totally blackened on the outside, perfectly cooked inside.<br />NO raw,rubbery taste.<br /><br />I went to my mom's this weekend. We tried to replicate Chef Mike's chicken.<br />We used a generic ShopRite Barbecue sauce. No way. It wasn't the same. After<br />three pieces, I had had it (and so did everyone else).<br /><br />I guess this sauce, General Tso's, along with the blackened flavor is what gave<br />Mike's chicken that unique, addicting taste, one of a kind, taste sensation (I<br />ate 5 lbs of chicken myself, at one sitting).<br /><br />Give it a try ... and if you like the really like the flavor of<br />sizzling grilled chicken .. try a piece or two... and if you get hooked,<br />make sure you invite me over for your next grilling !",1
"I have tried every k-cup out there, and I do mean every one.  These are the best by far.  Funny thing is, I don't care for Starbucks coffee in house.  The beans are over roasted making it bitter.  The k-cups are definitely not bitter and actually taste nothing like the house blend, and in my book this a good thing!  It's a medium/dark roast and very smooth.  Only con is the $$$price$$$.",1
"I'm a big Larabar fan, but after having a Kind bar I'm switching.  The nuts taste fresh and the fruit taste like fruit. The ingredient list is small and filled with great stuff.  I would definitely recommend this delicious bar.",1
Delicious!  A very definite treat for the tea lover.  'Will continue to order Stash teas from Amazon.  Even my favorite restaurant does not have this one yet!,1
"This tea is delicious.  I had received it as a present and couldn't find it in any local stores. I was so excited to find it at Amazon, and continue to enjoy it.  Now that I know the source, I'll be back for more.  It's the best tea I've had in a very long time.  It has a unique flavor and is good either very weak (which I like at night) or very strong (in the morning).  I also like the can it comes in and the cloth tea bags.  Strongly recommend.",1
"We have ordered this a few times and given it as gifts. It is relatively mild tasting and good for salads and drizzles on finished foods. For the price, it cannot be beat. Some of the artisanal olive oils may have a more complex taste, but, this one more than serves the purpose for us. An added plus is that it's organic. Important for those of us who want to cut down on ingesting pesticide toxins.",1
"This is a full bodied, smooth rich taste coffee for the coffee snob!  If you like Starbucks Pike's Roast (Dark Blend) then you will like Perugia Blend even better!",1
"I was born and raised in New Orleans. I have been a coffee lover as soon as I could drink from a cup! My great-grandmother would give it to me with lots of milk in it. Anyway, I have been through all of them all...back and forth... Community, CDM, Luzianne, French Market (red label), Union, PJ's...I even tried different types of pure coffee and adding my own chicory. I prefer the French Market Restaurant Blend. This one was introduced to me at a seafood restaurant called Coffee's Boiling Pot in Madisonville, LA. I love it. For me, it has the right blend of coffee and chicory (not hickory as some reviewer complained!) Of course,I wish the whole beans were available so that I could grind it myself.Anyway,it's a personal preference. Try it. If you don't like it, send it to me. I'll gladly drink it!",1
"Higgins & Burke Gourmet Tea was established by an old and trusted Canadian coffee and tea manufacturer - Mother Parkers. Higgins & Burke's Green Tea is a delicious tea, made of delicious green tea, enhanced with some lemongrass and lemon balm herb. It makes for a wonderful tea that is equally good hot and iced!<br /><br />If you like a good green tea, one that is more than just the normal, then I do think that you will like Higgins & Burke Green Tea. Heaven knows I did!",1
"Organic green beans, pear, and peas, in a portable bpa free pouch? Yes please! Best idea ever. To be honest, I do not like green beans, therefore don't cook them at home. My kids do love peas though. So, when I saw this, I thought we would try it, since that's the only way my kids will get green beans from me. And to our surprise, this is really good. I love the fact that HappyFamily adds organic vegetables to their food, and not just fruit, like other companies. Also, I love how they add the super grain SALBA (from the white chia seed) to some of their foods. This is a great way to give my kids the protein, fiber, and omega 3's they need. Plus one of my kids is gluten free, and SALBA is a GF grain she can eat. Great job HappyFamily.",1
"This toy has saved my sanity and my furniture!  Instead of my puppy chewing the furniture, he chews on this toy instead.  My puppy, who usually tires of toys in a day, has had this one for over a month and it is still the first toy he goes to each morning and the last toy he plays with before going to bed at night.  It took him an entire week of daily, constant chewing to just get through one of these cookies and when he did, he was very excited and pleased with himself!  Once he finished that one cookie, he went on the attack the second one.  I also put treats inside the ball, under the cookies and my dog loves trying to get through one cookie just to get to the treats inside.  I have never seen a cookie as hard and sturdy as these are and my dog loves every flavor he has tried so far.  I highly recommend this toy!  It has kept my active, hyper puppy amused, occupied and happy, every day.  I can not say enough good things about this toy, which is good for puppies and older dogs alike.  The only problem I have found is trying to keep enough of the cookie refills stocked in my home.  I wouldn't dream of running out of the cookie refills  for this toy !",1
"The Nespresso Machine was given to me as a gift and for a little extra a frother came with it. I haven't ventured over to the dark coffee side of expressos yet and am using the machine to prepare small cups or longos of coffee. The flavors are phenomenal. I haven't tasted one yet that I can't tolerate. I'll pop in a Nespresso pod, add my favorite flavored creamer to the frother, and in less than 5 minutes I have the best cup of coffee with warm fluffy cream I have ever tasted. My brother IS an expresso connoisseur and he couldn't keep his hands off the Nespresso, when he came to visit. The cleanup requires less than 5 minutes. Great invention and great cup of coffee.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00457KDRE"">Nespresso CitiZ C120 Espresso Maker with Aeroccino Milk Frother, Aluminum</a>",1
"This is a very enjoyable, refreshing tea with lemon and mint flavors. I think it's even a good dessert or snack tea. My grocery store is discontinuing Wissotzky - I found these teas on Amazon including this flavor which my store didn't stock. I'm really very happy with this tea and would order again.",1
I am hopelessly addicted to these jalape&ntilde;o pieces. Someone help me. I need some kind of medication to wean me off of them.,1
"Personally, I love this cool brew tea flavor, it is much, much better than regular iced teas.  It is cleaner, fresher, caffeine free and in my opinion very good. I know everyones taste buds are different, the taste of the tea is light, subtle,it is not overpowering, if this is what you like in an herbal tea than this is for you. I really like it and keep pitchers of it made year round as I am not a soda drinker, my choice, try it , it just may become yours too. I also recommend the Tropical Fruit cool brew also by Celestial Seansonings,another fav of mine.",1
"After feeding our 3 outdoor cats ""whatever is cheapest or on-sale cat food"" for a year, we noticed horrible skin problems on two of them.<br />There was also too much puffy orange cat vomit to clean up.<br />I began researching animal food in general and ended up with this product as an affordable, happy medium.<br />Within a month of this diet, their skin problems went away and their coats have a beautiful luster again.<br />Not one incidence of vomit has been seen with this food.<br />They eat less of this food because it is nutritionally dense with no by-products or corn meal.<br />My cats experienced a noticeable turn-around of health since beginning this diet.<br />I am glad to find it as a Subscribe & Save item.<br /><br />{{* *}}",1
"I remembered Junket mix from my childhood so I searched the Internet to find if it was still being made. Voila, of course and of course Amazon had it. I love it. Mix it up and put it in my ice cream maker, turn on the machine and shortly enjoy great ice cream. Yummm.",1
"This oatmeal is fabulous.  It is chewy and has a fabulous nutty flavor.  One drawback is it takes a long time to prepare, around 40 mins., but it reheats easily in the microwave so  I cook up several servings at a time.  Love it!",1
"We love this!  I make the bread and also add sugar, butter, cardamom and cinnamon to make cinnamon buns.  My family loves them!  We also use this dough for pizza.",1
"My cat changed completely when he started eating wilderness--he is more relaxed and contented and his fur is beautiful,,,,  I like this product because it is mostly meat which is what cats need to eat....",1
"My husband and I visited Kenya a couple of months ago.  I love tea, so I took advantage of being there and tried a bunch of different kinds of tea in our hotel.  This is by far THE BEST tea I've ever had!  There's no aftertaste.  It's just GOOD tea!  You don't need a ton of sugar or flavored creamers, but I will say that half & half gives it a nice texture (as Kenyans put milk in their tea like the British).  If you like tea, even the crazy expensive ones we have here in the US, give this one a try!  Don't let the price off-put you.  It tastes far better than the price would make it seem!",1
"Finally, I was able to purchase Good Seasons Cesar Dressing.  The grocery stores here don't carry it anymore!  Imagine my surprise that I was able to buy the dressing through Amazon.  The price is great and free shipping.  Mix with oil and vinegar and you've got the best dressing around!",1
"I'm pretty satisfied with this bag of chips for its flavor and the common ingredients it didn't add. Honestly speaking, what attracted me to purchase this in the first place was its claim of no preservatives, no trans-fat or MSG, and other stuff. Flavor-wise, I could taste the distinct flavor of different fruits. So far, my favorite was the melon chips even though the others were as tasty. By the way, the chips were shaped into perfect bite sizes for enjoyment. It's indeed a wonderful treat for any occasion.",1
I loved this bread. I have used some other brands before but this one is the best for me. I have now made 6 loaves of it and have been pleased every time. The taste is good and so is the texture. I love bread and when I found out I had a wheat allergy and could not eat regular bread anymore my heart sank. But since I found Pamela's Wheat Free & Gluten Free Bread Mix I am one happy Grandma again,1
"I bought the product for my in-laws, who live in Florida and cannot easily get it. They are very satisfied with the product.",1
"It is hard to find a food that is not the pate, loaf style, but instead has gravy and small pieces. This looks just like shredded chicken in a sauce. High quality product and made a huge difference in my cat's health.",1
"Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, ""that is why it is called green tea!""",1
"this is a great product for your Keurig brewer, has a rich taste and I look forward to my nightly cup of this delightful beverage",1
"I have tried MANY different coffee flavors since purchasing my Keuriq two years ago. Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee remains my favorite. It smells SO GOOD brewing and tastes even better! I buy it in bulk through Amazon and don't want to be without it!!! In fact, I think I'll purchase another box now!",1
"I fell for these bars when I was pregnant and was constantly hungry. The worst time for me was nighttime. Already awake for potty breaks, I didn't want to waste any more of my precious sleep time trying to fix and eat a filling, healthy, tasty snack. Snickers Marathon bars were ideal: high in protein, low enough on sugar (I didn't have gestational diabetes, but was cautious anyway), and super fast to prepare - just unwrap and open your mouth!<br /><br />As far as taste, I really loved these - even with the strange cravings and aversions of pregnancy. To me, they taste like your traditional Snickers (chocolate, caramel, peanut) met a typical granola bar (crispy crunchy texture), and they had a delicious affair, producing their love child, the Snickers Energy Marathon bar. Because they're so dense, I was able to snack on one for hours (of course, my squished stomach helped me feel fuller faster too). A few bites plus a small glass of milk was perfect.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these bars. It's hard to find a high-protein, low-sugar bar, and one that tastes good too? Almost impossible.  Now that I'm not pregnant, I still stash these in my diaper bag for fast fuel, and nibble on them when I'm up nursing at midnight.  I think anyone looking for a quick, filling snack should give these a try.",1
"My new 7 mo puppy I got from a shelter has demodetic mange. I was told by the staff there to wait until his immune system kicks in, but I felt sorry for him being itchy and that it was getting all over his mouth. Took him to a vet who dipped him with amitaban , but he got very lethargic right after, and he still needed to go through few more dips. I didn't wish to dip him any further. Looked around for alternative approach. Got him into Taste of the Wild Grain-Free Pacific Stream Dry Dog Food for Puppy, sprinkling supplement <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YFBF8"">Solid Gold Seameal Mineral and Vitamin Supplement for Horses, Dogs, and Cats (1 pound)</a>, and lastly, this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O5K0Y2"">Goodwinol Ointment (1 oz)</a>. He loves the food, he'd devour it until the bowl sometimes flips...:-). After a month, things are clearing up; he shades a lot (not sure whether it's because of the warm winter) - but his new coat - though feels thinner - turns to be really soft and shiny - and can't tell that he used to have mange. People would complement on what a softie he is, not just the fact that he's a sweet dog, but his coat is gorgeous and healthy. I am just glad these combination seems to works better than all those chemicals!!!",1
"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! But definitely buy a smaller package if it is your first time trying this!",1
Not heavy on taste...low fat and 0 trans fat.  Everyone loves these...trying to buy more but Amazon is out of stock!!!! OMG,1
"These new flavors are awesome! I went back and bought several more canisters because the display said it was for a temporary time only. My teenaged boys even like them.  I went to buy more, and the store no longer has them!  I need to have a steady supply of these.  They are all refreshing and sugar-free, so no guilt!  I guess I might be stuck ordering on line from now on.  I can't believe more peeps aren't asking for these flavors to be permanent!",1
"I tried the DynaPep version of an energy shot, and while I feel it did the job, I experienced low blood sugar often when I was on it, as well as a few other side effects. I bought a 2 pack of 5 hour energy just to see how it works, I wasn't expecting anything other then a gimmick; it was sitting in my closet for a week or two.<br /><br />Anyway I finally took the plunge and drank one- I only need to down a half a bottle- it does the job. I drink a half every day I work to get through the day, and let me tell you, I have missing cartilage in my hips and it was getting really uncomfortable to walk. I tried taking glucosamine, but due to my diabetes, the glucosamine was a no no. The only thing I found that works tolerably well is Aleve. But 5 hour energy puts Aleve to shame. If I have hip discomfort I don't feel it at all. I have all the energy I had when I was in my 20s, and for me a half bottle seems to last 8 hours or so!<br /><br />No problems whatsoever sleeping, in fact, due to all the activities it enables me to perform, I think it aids sleep! No swings in my blood sugar levels. All in all, perfect. So far...",1
"I bought this tea because I could not find the cranberry/apple flavor from Bigelow. I'd been drinking it in the office and liked it. I like the Pomegranate even better. And, I sometimes put in a smidge of creme de cassis = really a fab combination.",1
"I ordered these through Subscribe & Save so I get them every month.  The price for them in brick-and-mortar stores has gone up, but I'm now getting them from Amazon.com at the same price per candy that I used to pay in a local store.  My kids absolutely LOVE them; they usually polish them off early so I have to order another shipment before the next one is due.  I've tried them myself and they taste wonderful; if you love cherry flavor you won't be disappointed. It's great to have natural ""candies"" for my kids.",1
"These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!",1
Of all the energy drinks out there this one if by far the best and my favorite. unlike other drinks it doesn't rely on being super sweet to give you energy and It actually tastes good. Just be careful not to drink it too fast lol its got quite a kick when it hits you. Great for all nighters and gamming.,1
Awesome value for the money. Ordred a second one at the end of the summer and still have not opened it. Tastes as good as some of the more popular brands.,1
"I placed an order for three Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), thinking it was coffee. When I first looked at the product description it said 100% coffee. But it's 100% chicory and I called Amazon to clarify their description. I like the taste of chicory blended into my coffee. I use half a table spoon for every three spoons of coffee. It has a unique but pleasant flavor, but you can't drink it straight. I am not blaming Amazon and giving it five stars because it is what it is, chicory that is a good buy and helps flavor my coffee. If your a chicory fan then this review is useless. But if you are like myself, remember this is not coffee.<br />I hope you find my review helpful.",1
"I am forever buying the 2 ketchup, 1 relish, 1 mustard 4pack at Costco as my only way to get this item.  I end up giving away some ketchup and tossing the old relish when I have to buy the new because I've run out of mustard.  This is exactly the yellow mustard I wanted, not the spicy type, and has over a years dating.",1
"The Variety Pack is delicious and I love that they are all Vegan, Gluten Free, and Organic. There are 3 of each flavor in this box, and each one was yummy!",1
"These are great little bars to snack on. Great for taking along to school or work. They are pretty good tasting and just the right size. I have consumed about six boxes of these over the last year and found them to be consistent in quality. They are slightly moist and not overly sweet like figs should be. If you are looking for a substitute for candy bars, these will do the trick. Nothing but figs, no crust.",1
These treats are great! My dogs love them and they are natural and healthy. You can't beat that. : ),1
I don't know what they put in this stuff but my dogs go absolutely crazy for it and the Amazon price was by far the lowest.<br /><br />Rich,1
Bought this during one of Amazon's Friday Sales.  Did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new.  Took a chance and am very pleased.  We like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers.  Great tasting dark roast coffee!,1
"I have to drink decaf tea in the evenings and before I found this Typhoo I always had to trade off decent tasting tea for being able to sleep at night. But Typhoo decaf makes a very robust and flavorful pot of tea. On more than one occasion, somebody in the family has grabbed this decaf by mistake and nobody even realized it was decaf until we noticed the distinctive round bag in the bottom of the pot. This tea is best brewed by the pot using fully boiling water. If you try to make it by the individual cup using 190 degree water or water heated in a microwave, you'll probably be disappointed. Besides compromising the flavor, brewing by the cup would be wasteful since a single bag makes a good three cups of tea. The only compromise needed when brewing this decaf over regular black tea is the decaf needs to steep a bit longer (I'd say ten minutes) for maximum flavor. Alternatively, you can limit the water to two cups and then it's ready in about six minutes. Typhoo also makes regular caffeinated black tea which I consider to be just average.",1
"I am so excited!  I LOVE hummus, but it's so expensive at the stores.  These garbanzo beans make hummus easily at my fingertips.<br /><br />Throw a can into the food processor, some tahini (found here on Amazon), garlic, and lemon juice, yogurt (or silken tofu--I use the tofu)...maybe paprika (I like the smoked paprika)...and well-la!  Major YUMMY.  I added peanut butter to one recipe and people LOVED it.<br /><br />Hummus is great for you, can easily be made vegan, an goes on everything from fresh veggies to sandwiches to meats.<br /><br />I will be ordering this again and again.  The beans were flavorful and the texture perfect.  The fact that they are organic is a plus, and the price can't be beat.",1
"This is my favorite flavor of coffee for my Keurig.  I like coffee that is a lighter brew, and this is perfect. I was happy to find it at an even lower price here.",1
"This is absolutely delicious. If you want grapefruit soda, THIS IS NOT IT. It has a subtle, yet intoxicating hint of grapefruit flavour!",1

"I love this oatmeal. I am 52 years old and have always hated oatmeal, until I found Holly's! Holly's is the best! My familay eats it every day!",1
"This is really a good snack.  I tell myself that the whole grain makes it a little better than other things I could eat.  The item still had plenty of shelf left, based on its 'best by' date, but there's no way Cheez-it's are going to remain uneaten in my household long enough to worry about that.",1
"I had not heard of this brand before, and happened upon it in my local grocery store.  The lower price for a box of 12 cups made me take notice, so I thought I'd try it.  Instant coffee gratification :-)  This is a strong cup of coffee, but it's not overwhelming - at least to my taste.  I prefer some kick and this has got it.  I love the environmentally friendly pod as well.  Definitely will be subscribing and saving!",1
"This popcorn is very good, tasty, crunchy. Orville Redenbacher can't even compare to this, it is so much better.  This popcorn is delicious and we will purchase it again.",1
"Received order as advertised, everything was in excellent condition.<br />My cat Mandy is 19 years old and in excellent health, many thanks to Wellness no grain cat foods.",1
"I love this, have been using and it is great.  I use it for my hair and for my daughter's hair as well.  It makes the hair sooo soft.  I could not ask for better.  Please know that it will be hard to get out if cold.  I usually hold the bottle between my thighs when I brush my daughter's hair then my body heat makes it softer and I can pour it into my hands and into her hair.  I will never use anything else for conditioning.  It is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have not tried eating yet.  Just cant find it in me to try yet!  But will submit review when I do!",1
"I use these at work, for the too many occasions when I do not have time for a real lunch.",1
"Thank you Amazon for bringing in this excellent product. Yes, it is crumbles a little when you open a package so you need to open it carefully. I open the package and carefully take bread out. I use my ceramic knife to cut it in half. Then I put those halves in plastic bag. The bread doesn't break after you toast it. I love rye bread; I love its smell, taste, consistency. I cannot get enough of this bread. One reviewer said that the bread is not fresh. Well, it is vacuum packed bread and tastes a little different from bread right from the oven. Thank you to Feldkamp's amazing process we have this tasty German bread on our plates. Well done Amazon!",1
"My dogs get a variety of rawhide bones, from dingo's to the generic Wal-Mart rawhides. My German Shepherd and Boxer love<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF06JI"">Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, Natural Chips, 5-Pound Bag</a> rawhide bones and with the costs of these bones skyrocketing, I was looking for a bulk pack that was affordable. I found it in the Green Cow listing here on Amazon. We ordered, and it arrived, very surprisingly, the next day. The good news is that this is a large bag and most of all, has not upset the sensitive stomach of my 120lb big GSD baby and my sweetie Boxer is very happy with her new treats.  I have recommended this product to friends and family and will be ordering on a regular basis.",1
"This a wonderful tea. Smooth and great flavor ,one of my favorites.I will be ordering again. Second order was excellent. Im enjoying this tea and always looking forward to my first morning cup!!!!",1
"I originally purchased only 1 of these for my Labrador because she loves her Kong so much.  My Border Collie mix could usually care less for such things.  However, when the treat ball arrived, they fought over it so I had to buy another one!  Unfortunately, they still bicker over them, which is odd because my dogs NEVER fight with each other so we'll see.  It may be a toy that only gets put down when I am home to watch them.  But judging by their behavior, this treat ball is the greatest thing ever!",1
"I've purchased these at Walmart.  I'm slightly ashamed to say a bag doesn't last more than a day in our house.  I'm mostly to blamed for that. :)  They are a little higher in fat then I would like.  However, they are much better than Fritos!",1
"When I thought about buying these seeds there was only one other review. It was a good review so I decided to take a chance and buy the seeds. I am so glad I did. First of all they gave me a bonus package of seeds! And not one of the herbs that was already included in the set. The individual seed packets look exactly like the picture. They all have directions for planting the seeds, watering and sunlight exposure. All of my seeds have sprouted. There were no dead seeds. They certainly delivered the goods! and now it is all up to me. I would highly recommend Seed Needs for their herb seed packets. Great stuff!",1
"The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.",1
"This rice takes a long time to cook in my rice cooker, nearly an hour. But it holds up well and does not get mushy. The texture is wonderful. I will be reordering this rice frequently, as we have gone through three jars in a little over a month. So far, this is our favorite of the RiceSelect brand.",1
"Of all the K-Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button. I like other coffee selections too, but this one really stands out.<br /><br />I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40-.50 a cup, there is no waste, no pot cleanup, and, best of all, great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.<br /><br />I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K-Cups, but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs",1
This Stevia is the best we have tried.  We use it in our tea and now we can't stand the taste of real sugar in our tea.  There is no bitter aftertaste like some stevia products we have tried.  I highly recommend Now Stevia.,1
"I know it's the off time for smoked turkeys and the such but it didn't deter us from trying this 6-8 lb smokehouse bird.  Old tom came packed correctly and cryo wrapped.  It is tender, easy to carve and cooked all the way through.  It took us maybe 30 minutes to carve the bird and stack the meat up high.  A complete bird ready to go without the fuss.  Order with confidence and expect it to be shipped within a reasonable amount of time.  Gobble gobble.",1
"This stuff originated in ancient Egypt apparently...I don't like black licorice...but I love this tea...just add a little Stevia or some sugar, and it's a healthy sweet taste, even without sweetner...I wish the packaging was a little better...instead of just having them ""dumped"" into an empty box and shipped...oh well...",1
this is the best seasoning whether it is used in stuffing or in soups.  It has been a family staple for 50+ years.  Nothing compares to it's perfection!,1
"Peach is my fav Bakto flavor, yes even better than mango. I use Bakto flavors to make flavored sugar free, fat free Greek yogurt and believe me this is the best. This is made with grain alcohol, so it is best to pour the extract in your mixing bowl and wait an hour to let the alcohol evaporate. Measure 1 oz extract, pour and wait 1 hour. Mix well 8-10tiny scoops of Kal stevia (Kal's the best). Then add 48 oz chobani 0% plain yogurt, stir well and add 2-2 1/2 cups of diced strawberries and bananas. Sweet Heaven Yogurt.",1
I have tried alot of bottled water and usually go right back to drinking the water from my tap.  Fiji is the first bottled water I have tried and will buy it again.  It has the taste of refreshing water.  The way it should be.,1
"This is a excellant seasoning for many different meats, soups, ect. when BBQing.<br />I just can't say enough good about Tone's Garlic & Herb Seasoning. If you havn't tried it, give it a try.<br />Thanks.Amy<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZSF08"">Tone's Garlic & Herb Seasoning (20 oz) Large Restaurant / Food Service Shaker Top Size Container</a>",1
"In my opinion, St. Dalfour is the best brand of tea.  The strawberry tea is wonderful hot.  I need to put in a few more words, apparently.",1
"I used to make my spaghetti dinners from scratch and nothing beats that. But when your time and energy is limited, compare an excellent homemade dinner that takes 2 hours to prepare plus cleanup versus a very good dinner that takes 15 minutes and little cleanup. It's a no-brainer for me.",1
"While I was away at college my friend's neighbors had brought these pretzels with them to her party.  They were the best pretzels I had ever eaten.  Since graduation I've been on a 3 year search looking for these pretzels, and here they are on Amazon.  No kidding, best pretzels ever.",1
My local stores don't sell this and the local mass merchant only has them when they buy in bulk....<br /><br />Amazon always has these factory fresh and you can't beat the UTZ.... always good foods,1
"Years ago I had this product in a coffee shop that I ran and am so delighted to find it on the open market to still be able to purchase, as I do often.<br />I had many customers exclaim that this product was the best that they have ever had and I tend to agree, there are some others that are good, yet I find myself going to Big train time and again.<br />Great Job- keep it up.",1
"The tahini is great. I've used it already to make hummus twice and also found a tasty recipe for tahini cookies that I tried and loved (very lo-cal, no flour). The jars I ordered came intact and ahead of schedule. Absolutely no complaints.",1
"This is my favorite tea, which I obviosly drink by the case since that's how I buy it.  the prices is a good value for the product.",1
My dog likes this food.  Its high quality and not full of by-products.  And do you know what less by-product means?  LESS POOP.  True fact.,1
I got this for my husband as a present since we both love these Jellies for my.  Was amazed to see it in such a large quantity,1
"I have been a big fan of Hint since I first discovered it at the grocery store. My favorite had always been watermelon. I'm leery about trying new things, especially when they come in a case. Based on the positive reviews, I decided to give Raspberry-Lime a try. I am glad I did. I LOVE this flavor! It is now my new favorite. It's not at all strong. It has just the right amount of essence. It's terrific for a refreshing drink. It's a nice change of pace from over-sweet water beverages (even the no sugar variety). I can't recommend this enough! Try it. You won't regret it.",1
Any true peanut butter & chocolate fan will love this product!!! It taste wonderful just on it's own. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.,1
"This product is really good. My baby loves it every time!!! He can eat it by itself as breakfast, lunch or dinner! I also sometimes mix it with my homemade food when I need to improve its texture or flavor (too spicy, too lumpy e.t.c). Great healthy option no matter how you want to offer it to your baby or toddler.",1
"These are pricier than another popular brand I purchased here on Amazon a while back. But I like these better . They are plump, juicy with just the right amount of tartness. I may just subscribe and save 15% per order. I use cherries in salads and add to my homemade yogurt. YUM!!",1
"These are not a tasty little snack to help you stay on your diet.  They taste terrible.  The first time I tried one, I couldn't believe that they were actually identified as food.  As a friend of mine said, ""these don't even taste like they are supposed to be edible.""  I was motivated to lose weight, so I ate them with peanut butter or almond butter.  After a couple of weeks of losing weight, I could eat them straight with a large glass of water.  Don't get me wrong, I still do not think that they taste good, but they are edible, with some effort and patience.  More importantly, they really work.  I've lost 30 pounds and have 15 left to go, so I'll be buying one more case or so.",1
"I bought something like this at an unnamed national coffee chain (you can guess which Washington-based company I'm referring to) and thought they were delish.  So I googled the product and lo and behold! They were on Amazon!<br /><br />I had not had Sahale's product but they were GREAT!  Vanilla-y, sweet, a little fruit-y due to the pomegranate and just a tiny bit of salt adds that that great sweet-salt combination!  I'm anticipating eating these for a long time, they're tasty!",1
"After becoming a little more aware of what ingredients I put in my body and being an avid griller, I picked out Stubb's Spicy BBQ sauce because it does NOT have high fructose corn syrup in it, which is RARE! It seems like almost all of the other BBQ sauces have HFCS. Stubb's brand was around $5.50, a lot more expensive then the mainstream brands like KC Masterpiece and Sweet Baby Rays.<br /><br />I'm glad I spent the couple extra bucks on this because it is GOOD!!! It is a little spicy, but it is delicious!! This is the only brand of BBQ sauce I buy now if I do buy BBQ sauce. About 95% of the time I make my own BBQ sauce, but when I'm feelin' lazy, I reach for a bottle of Stubb's! Great BBQ sauce! Worth checkin' out if you're looking for a healthier alternitive to your regular BBQ sauce!",1
"It is a good product where you get the best out of your drink, it is good taste in lime and orange favor in an concentrated pill that makes delicious drink.",1
"Aunt Jemima Original Syrup is a beautiful golden-brown, delicious, artificially-flavored vestige article of Jim Crow South.  It continues to elevate the unrivaled privilege of its white owners' progeny, while conversely, it's success in the 19th century was achieved with successes in marketing which centered on the exploitation of the image of a playfully ignorant African American woman otherwise aptly described as the quintessential ""mammy"" archetype. Revel in nostalgia for the good ol' days as you lather your pancakes in Jemima's sweet forbidden nectar and taste the spirit of the 1800s!",1
"My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by the bag of granola from Nature's Path.<br /><br />1/4 cup (30 grams) is 140 calories, with 6 grams of sugar (or 1/5, 20% of the serving).<br /><br />20 grams of carbs, and 2 grams of fiber.  A touch of salt, and 6 grams of fat, another 20% of the serving.<br /><br />Everything in the product is Organic, other than the salt (can that even be not organic?).<br /><br />Anyways, this is a nice topper to sugar free cereals or low sugar cereals.  And also it is a nice with sugar free almond milk.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this sweet indulgence, in moderation.  The dark chocolate is a teeny bit bitter, which I like, and the strawberries add even more love.",1
"this is a nice smooth green tea. actually, I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea, and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it, and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. I have not found a bad flavor. : )",1
"I have bought two boxes of these now and love them.  My first box came from a local health food store and the second came from Amazon.  Yum Yum.  As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.",1
I'd been buying this same tea from Vitacost for years and was happy to find it on Amazon because Amazon is my main online shopping site.  The tea is consistantly very good and organic at a price I don't think can be beaten elsewhere.  The tea bags have string and tag which I wish they would do away with but other than that the product is perfect.,1
"I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir",1
One of Michael Keaton's early and best performances. The scene at the dinner table with Harry Belafonte's classic soundtrack is great. I'm not a fan of ultra lib' Alec baldwin but this is really Michael Keaton's movie.,1
My sister has many food allergies. She had had this licorice previously and did fine with it. When she asked for some for Christmas this was perfect! She loved every bite.,1
"They don't look like they have that big of a layer of chocolate but the chocolate taste really comes through well.  And the peanut-butter chips are awesome.  Clocking in at 110 calories each these bars are a great snack for those of us who are dieting or at least trying to.  They give you all the sweetness that you are craving and are large enough to satisfy you until your next meal.<br /><br />These are going to be a no-brainer for me.  My kids both love these, my husband also says he thought they were really good - so everyone in the family likes them... even those not dieting - how can you go wrong with these?",1
"Not only are they a great side dish, I use it to make soups too.. very tasty",1
"All I can say is that I love this stuff. I use two bags along with one bag of Green Tea in the morning with breakfast and it provides me with loads of energy.<br /><br />Warning, If I drink it after 1:00 PM it keeps me awake most of the night so use care if you want to get any sleep and use it at breakfast.<br /><br />Thought I should mention that when I placed my order it was only for a box of coca tea. The description has changed since I placed my order.",1
This is a really good tea.  I am drinking it during my pregnancy to tone the uterus.  Very good taste!,1
My 1 year old loves these! Great snack! I've tried to find these at my stores and can't seem to get them very often. Love that they are organic and my one year old loves that Elmo is on the box!,1
"I absolutely love this cappuccino! I had my doubts, but they were proved wrong! I myself have a sweet tooth and I was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino. But thankfully, I was worng and it had the right blend of both. I had 2 cups the first day I bought it! Shared it with my family, they loved it too!",1
These are my very favorite K cups of all I have tried...and I have tried a lot.  It is also a good value,1
This hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates I have tried.  It is not watery.  I have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both.,1
"I have a basset hound who loves to get in trouble if he's not occupied.  He's also highly motivated by food.  These two things make the tug a jug perfect for him.  I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this, I put the plug back in.  He now spends 1.5-2 hours a day trying to empty this thing.  When he's done, he collapses and sleeps.  It's a beautiful thing.  I feed him all his meals in it now and it's his favorite toy.",1
Love this dark chocolate. We could not find it in any store until just lately. I think this is the best dark chocolate we have ever had. A friend from Germany gave us a bar and we have been hooked ever since. Funny thing is before I had this chocolate bar I never liked dark chocolate. Who knew!,1
"My husband can finally have bread with dinner!  Great taste.  I make ahead of time, freeze, then cook when I need it.",1
"I have tried many of the K-cup coffees. The Newman's extra bold is one of the best. Absolutely no bitterness. Strong, flavorful and mellow all the way. You will love it. (Unless you're a fan of weak coffee).",1
My brother-in-law is Vietnamese and a very hard man to buy for when its time to give gifts. The one thing he loves is Vietnamese cooking and my sister does her best to please. This Birthday I sent her some recipe books that required these. They live in a small town and the closest international store is two hours away. They passed the taste test!!,1
"I really expected to be disappointed, as I had never found a wheat-free bread in the health food store that wasn't dense or gummy.  This bread was easy to make, and baked up light and fluffy in the oven, almost like white flour bread would, only a little more moist. I added some hemp nuts, 2 tsp pizza spices and some onion powder.  The flavor was heavenly! The package has directions for all the uses it advertises and suggests ways to make specialty breads, e.g. herb bread, cinnamon bread, etc.  I'm very pleased with the product!",1
"i LIKE The real stuff.  This is so flavorful and REAL SYRUP.  only buy the true stuff that is regulated to not be diluted or altered.  This is real maple syrup and I love the dark amber color.  I'm now getting it shipped every month on automatic shipping.<br /><br />I use this syrup in my green smoothies that I blend in my Vitamix.  Pancakes? Oh, of course I do!!!  I've used it in my marshmallows I've made (see my other reviews on the best Marshmallow cookbook I got on Amazon), the maple syrup marshmallows are to die for.<br /><br />I cure and smoke my own bacon on my Weber Smoky Mountain Smoker (that I also got on Amazon) and use this syrup to cure the pork belly.  Add a bit when frying the bacon, too, for that maple goodness.<br /><br />Make the best pork chops...toss a pound of chops in the nesco cooker on 250 degrees, top with a can of sourkraut and half a cup of this maple syrup and a bit of fresh black pepper.  That's it.  let it cook all day.  Ohhhhh my it's good eating.  Don't forget to make some biscuits to go with it!!!<br /><br />Buy quality, this is quality and it's worth every penny.",1
"I wasn't sure how much candy I was ordering, but I spread these across 24 boxes, and they each got maybe 12 sets of feet each. I did have other candies for the favor boxes, but I wish I had gotten a second bag.  They were good candies, several of the guests told me they liked them after the shower.",1
"I first learned about this product a year ago, and I've been giving it to my cats ever since. They get it once a day as a treat, and they love it. If there is a flavor of food that they may not be too crazy about, and I have nothing better to give them at a moment, then this will do the trick. I sprinkle it on top and they will eat it all no matter what. Also, when I clip their nails they get it for putting up with it, as well as if there is some special occassion. In overall, this is the best treat that I've ran accross, safe, apparently tasty, and one box can last me over a month, for two cats. I wish I could find it in local pet food stores.",1
"Without a doubt the best combo of heat and flavor i've ever had, I buy both the original and Xtra hot and use it in just about everything. Buy extra, when your friends try it they will steal your bottle.",1
"I bought Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for my finicky Boston Terrier after visiting my mom's and she gave him a dried chicken meat treat which he devoured. But I didn't like how brittle and hard the jerky treat was and made me concerned about him choking on it, even after breaking them into bite size pieces. I found Dogswell Vitality for Dogs at Target and gave it try after feeling through the bag that it wasn't as hard as the other dried meat treats with a slight bendable feel to it plus the disclaimer that the flaxseed and vitamins included helped dog's healthy eyes, skin and coat. The reason the disclaimer appealed to me is my dog has dry, flaky skin and occasionally gets dry patches.<br /><br />I have tried all types of shampoos, both prescribed by the vet and store bought, even RX fish oil pills from my vet, which I disliked giving my dog because I don't like putting pill in mouth daily since I couldn't trick him by putting it on his food. I can say none of them worked near as well as Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for his skin problems.<br /><br />I've been given my dog, who weighs approx. 18 lbs., two to three strips a day broken into bite size pieces for nearly two months now. After about two weeks, I noticed the flaky dry skin scales weren't as noticeable and now it's barely noticeable at all. When I noticed the difference at two weeks I started ordering Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because I knew this treat was going to be a regular part of my dog's daily meal plan going forward and the program helps cut the cost of these expensive dog treats.<br /><br />I do recommend in an additional to this treats zip bag, putting the treats in a second ziploc type bag to help keep the jerky strips from drying out further and loosing it small bit of moisture. I have found this keeps the jerky strips as moist as when you first open the bag. And even though these jerky treats aren't as brittle and hard as it's competitors, they are still brittle enough that I feel I need to break them into bite size pieces for my dog.",1

"Absolutely the best & once again an item you can't find locally anymore but sure enough Amazon came through again & had an item we love!  This True Lime makes the best rub on meats, of course good for drinks too, so if you love a lime or lemon flavor on chicken, steak & even pork chops or fish give it a try because it has a more intense lime flavor than fresh lime! YUMMY!!!",1
I orderd the weisswurst from saag`s as a surprise for my sister and brother in law because they liked it very much when I served it during their visit in germany. And - what a surprise - they were thrilled to get the saag`s weisswurst because as they say: It is the best you can get in the US. They used to buy it years ago in California but moving to MO. they lost track of saag`s. As always: It was a pleasure to shop with amazon.com and an even greater pleasure to get the sausage they like in an excellent quality. Thank You! I will definately order again.,1
Our whole family loves the Dr Oetker muffins. All the flavors are good....I have no idea why they discontinued our favorite: lemon poppyseed. Easy to make and taste delicious. You can add some grated carrots or zucchini to make it a little healthier for your kids. Yum!,1
We were very pleased with this product and the short time in which we received it.,1
"Bought these k-cups on a Friday sale and used the subscribe & save option for an excellent deal on another 50 k-cups.  Haven't tried this flavor before, so it was a gamble since I was going to be stuck with 50 coffees if I didn't enjoy it.  Fortunately, the reviews were correct, this is a good, flavorful coffee.  A bit lighter than I was used too, but that enabled me to use less creamer (Chocolate Toffee) than I normally would need.<br /><br />Amazon shipped this package quickly, all were in great shape, and the k-cups don't expire until next March.",1
"I love salmon caviar and other expensive caviars with large eggs. This was a gamble that the taste would be good without the expense. I am well satisfied. The eggs are very small but a thin layer spread on top of cream cheese on a bagel was just right. To really get the flavor though, it is necessary to chew the eggs. Their smallness means you might just swish them in your mouth with your tongue and that won't impart the full flavor.",1
"I have tried several K-cup Hazelnuts, and this one is, by far, my favorite.  In the past, I had Wolfgang Puck's version, Green Mountain and Gloria Jeans.  The Van Houtte outshines them all.  If you are a Hazelnut coffee fan, try this one.",1
"Recently made this Dr. McDougalls oatmeal and found it the best, the easiest, the healthiest I have ever had; I am so glad I found it on Amazon and thrilled that Amazon carries so many Gluten Free and healthy brands.  I prepared it in the microwave and unlike other brands with artificial thickeners, it did not bubble over.  My new favorite hot breakfast just in time for the cold weather!  I can't wait to try his Split Pea soup and will be ordering again soon.",1
I purchase this product for the office. The clients like it and it is not too over-powering. I appreciate the savings through Subscribe & Save!,1
"How can you compare a cookie made of chocolate, marshmallow, and raspberry to a lemon cookie.  Dare makes both - Whippet and Lemon Creme.  They are both just as good, no great.  Best cookies ever!",1
"Such a tasty cookie... soft, flavorful.  Mmm.<br /><br />I was highly surprised at how good these were.  Yum!  The portion was quite generous, making for a nice afternoon snack.",1
"Nice tart lemonade flavor with just a hint of raspberry. I don't care for overly sweet drink mixes, and this one is just about perfect. I like it better than Crystal Light's lemonade or pink lemonade.<br /><br />My local store carries this, but at nearly double the cost here on Amazon (although Amazon's prices vary widely from seller to seller). I need to drink more water, and this helps.",1
These are not always easy to find in grocery stores but I was thrilled to find them here.  I love these and find they're perfect for packing lunches.  The taste and consistency are superior.  Thank you!,1
"Of the three flavors of Celsius I have tried (orange, raspberry tea and now cola) the cola is the best tasting.  Although if you mix the orange with some diet Sunkist soda that's not bad either.<br /><br />I drink one can a day, about 20 minutes before I work out.  I have noticed an improvement in my workouts (improved strength and endurance).  Furthermore, drinking Celsius has been a contributing factor in my ability to lose 23 pounds over the last 4 months.<br /><br />I believe if consumed in moderation, adding Celsius to your diet can be very beneficial.",1
"I had a noticeable reduction in osteoarthritis pain after my first cup, about equivalent to the relief I get from the moderate prescription painkiller I take. I use a little sweetener with one tea bag and 16 ounces of water.  I like the taste but will try the suggested 2-3 tea bags in the future.",1
"Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees in Juicy Pear and Garden Greens makes a great meal for my daughter when we're on-the-go.  I tried a pouch myself, and it's tasty to me, for baby food, and my daughter really likes it as well.  When we're out and about and it's mealtime for her, this simple puree squirts right out of the pouch onto a spoon, or a Boon Spoon actually fits right on the end of the pouch, which makes it even simpler.  At home, I mix Juicy Pear and Garden Greens in with other baby food meals or with some cereal.  And because it's organic, I feel good about giving it to my daughter.",1
The Gimborn Liver Treats are by far my dogs favorite treat.  The are a wonderful training reward.  Very good quality.  Just beware your dog will sniff them out from wherever they are hidden in your pockets.,1
I had these wonderful chips in Ireland a few years ago on vacation and was sad that I could not find them in America.  Now that I have I will be in so much trouble ordering them all the time.  I love these chips!!!,1
The product looked good in the packaging and tasted great. I used some in gift baskets and they were well recieved. Will probably buy more for the holidays.,1
"I dip these in my coffee -- alone they are probably a bit too crisp.  However, these have excellent flavor and a great ginger burn after you've had 5-10 of them.  Highly recommended.",1
"This tea which actually contains no tea is a good, decaf alternative.  Nice flavor and light red color to enjoy.",1
I bought these along with the Razzmatazz drops and the cinnamon is very good also. The flavor is just strong enough that you get a good idea that it is cinnamon your eating. I like eating one of these right after a meal to get the minty feel in my mouth.  I like the idea that I can still satisfy my sweet tooth and feel good that there isn't any really bad stuff in this product. I'm looking forward to trying many of the other flavors that YummyEarth has come up with! Enjoy!,1
"After reading several articles maintaining that vitamin supplements are basically a scam, with no positive correlation to health or longevity, I decided to ditch my multivitamin and switch to a natural food supplement instead. The ingredient list in Green Superfood is impressive-I'm not sure how costly it would be to duplicate through juicing but this accomplishes the same goal for me without all the shopping, food prep and cleanup! In the past year I've cleaned up my diet quite a bit, but I always seem to come up short in consuming green leafy vegetables, so this product fills that gap nicely. As for the drinkability, I have tried mixing with V8 and some water. Not very good. Today I tried mixing with just straight water, and surprisingly, it wasn't bad! My advice to anyone who wants to get the best health result: don't use Green Superfood as a magic bullet that allows you to make multiple bad food choices on a daily basis. Dump the processed sugars, refined flours and sweet drinks, eat as many natural foods and whole grains as possible and over time, your palate will readjust to a normal state. Your cravings should become manangeable and weight/fat loss will begin to occur naturally! I would definitely recommend this product to any busy, health-minded and budget-conscious person who wants an easy way to enhance their diet!",1
"My cat doesn't like any of the typical grocery store type cat treats.  However, I discovered that he just loves these fiber treats. He actually cries for them every morning...now I have to make sure I don't run out of these.  He's 15 years old and I figure the fiber can't hurt either.",1
"Stash makes a really good chamomile, and the price they were offering this for was very reasonable.",1
Rec'd product in a timely manner.  Enjoy Andersen's Pea Soup.  It is wonderful,1
"I just received 7 pounds of coffee directly from the Orleans Coffee Exchange, not knowing that Amazon carried it.  It's cheaper to go directly through the manufacturer (which is a rarity) - $8.99 per bag and 1 bag free with the purchase of 7.  The Bananas Foster doesn't let on to how good it is when you open the bag, but when brewed it is smooth as silk and the banana essence is not the artificial flavor you'd get from a cheap brand.  I immediately contacted the seller after my first cup to commend them on their product and promptly order 10 more bags of coffee.  GREAT COFFEE!!!!",1
"I searched everywhere for a Gluten Free boullion and this is it. It also tastes better than other brands I've had and rivals Better Than Boullion brand. Prefer it for long term storage as well. I use 2 cubes (sometimes crumbled and sprinkled on top of, or mixed into meat) with 1/4c dehydrated onion in place of Lipton Onion Soup Mix in all my usual recipes.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would emphasize that it is Gluten Free (it says it right on the jar but you cannot always read it in the picture) it would have made my search easier.",1
Awesome Thomas pez dispensers. We got these for our son 3rd birthday party and everyone LOVED them. The lemon flavored candy was not very tasty but the kids ate it anyway. Would recommend for children of all ages!,1
"Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds).",1
"I am by no means a 'morning person' but the smell and flavors of these coffees makes mornings a bliss.  The smell, as soon as you open the package you want to just dive your nose into it.  The flavor is just superb, no bitterness and before I know it my cup is empty and I need more!  Even the look of those dark ground makes my heart twitter.  I have tried many coffees over the years and this is my FAVORITE brand by far.  It's hard to want to drink any other brand.",1
My son never ate any of these kind of foods. Started with this & he is doing good with these packs. Am a happy parent.,1
"These muffins. THESE MUFFINS! Every time I lift one of these muffins to my lips, I distinctly hear a voice in my head say ""I am so excited to eat this muffin."" I kid you not. These are the most delicious muffins I have ever tasted, and by far the healthiest. And so tasty. Other muffins will bow down in shame when you bake these at home. Make them with apple juice and blueberries, then eat them all at a picnic in the sun held in your honor while the world slowly passes you by. That is how great these muffins are. Eat them.",1
"I  recieved the Navitis Cocao Power, it came in the form of a powder and it was very rich and very fine and it dissolves quite well in liquid. I like the flavor very much. Ican tell it comes from the criollo variety. I like to use it in my french press coffee mug it makes a very rich ice cold alternatives to coffee. the good thing about it is it so fine that you can even steep it cold water so  you can keep all of the nutrients instead of heating up. sure it's a little bit expensive but a little bit goes a long way I just use a teaspoon in a 8 ounce glass of water and is flavors of very well. I am very happy with this product I would recommend it to anyone it's also good in baked goods.",1
"I've been drinking red raspberry leaf tea throughout my pregnancy after my midwife recommended it for cramping and it really helped.  I got sooooo tired of straight red raspberry leaf though so I decided to try this one instead.  I'm not a huge mint fan, so I was a little worried since this has spearmint that I wouldn't like it,  but it's only a hint of mint, so I don't mind it.  I'm especially happy that it has stinging nettles in it since I worry about my iron levels and have heard nettles help.",1
This tastes wonderful.  I can taste a buttery nuttiness to it.  I will be using this from now on.  Good price if you get the subscription,1
"Zico in plastic bottles is the best idea since, well, Zico.  I love that the containers are recyclable now, and they fit in my car's cup holders!",1
"I'll order this again instead of buying oyster sauce from the store.  I think it is better, but not dramatically better. I use oyster sauce in what are probably unusual ways, like to add a bit of umami to meat or to flavor a broth.  The shipping was fast and it was packaged well.",1
"What I like about these is that they are gluten free, full of flavor and have a hearty corn flavor. They are a bit thicker than some of the chips I've tried out there and hold the salsa!  Love these!",1
These cheeses arrived promptly.  They were carefully packaged in a foam container with dry ice...maintaining the perfect temperature.<br />A good selection of aged cheeses.,1
i use it everyday for work.  easy to clean. dishwasher safe. no mildew. the handle is very sturdy. it shipped fast. nothing bad to say about it and it was a whole lot less expensive than the other big name brand water bottles.,1
I used to buy Beef Jerky from the local store. But this is heaven woow that is it. Recomend this product to anyone.,1
Great for making margaritas. Add an ounce or 2 to your drink and some fresh cilantro for a nice change.,1
"I'm never dissapointed with the great gadgets this company comes out with. My brother picked up the new Concerto for me and it is absolutely awesome! My wife likes whites and I like reds, so the 2 stoppers really come in handy. Also, I love the new clicking sound it makes when the vacuum is at the correct level. Neat design, great looking gift, the absolute best invention for saving wines.",1
I love this El Yucateco Green Chile sauce. It's got a little heat and a lot of flavor. This and Valentina are my two favorite Mexican sauces. They're big on flavor. I love this sauce on tacos. The prices here are ridiculous. This sauce should come in at under $2 for the 4 oz bottle.,1
"I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts.",1
"I tried a few other dog food brands along with this one. I would give my dog this food, other brand the next day -cheaper or more expensive- and my dog consistently always liked this one better. He is a small breed dog, two years old, and we now only buy PURINA. By the way, I have to add that I always had a great amount of respect for PURINA, and it has never let me down. These guys consistently have been working to provide the highest products for pets for the right amount of money. You do not need to buy super fancy ridiculous food for your pet. This has all your dog needs at the right price. I am a loyal customer, and my dog is well fed, happy, and most important, healthy! Strongly recommended.",1
I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.,1
"I make smoothies, Lots of smoothies. Both this, and PB2 straight-up ... are my favorite additions.  Chocolate shakes with chocolate PB2 are like eating a very chocolaty peanut butter cup ...through a straw ... with the fat removed  ...  Sinful without the guilt!!!  Add a few extra ice cubes and it turns thick as soft ice cream. OMG!  If you're on a diet (or not), this my friend, is your new guilty pleasure. I know it's mine! Try it.  You will be hooked.",1
This breakfast cookie tastes great and keeps you full all morning long. I like the flavor and the soft chewy texture.,1
"Just got the most precious plant..SO beautiful and better than I expected..Loved it so much ,going to order two more. Everything you would want in a bonsai and so much more..",1
"These were the most delicious caramel treats I have ever had! We devoured them as soon as they arrived at our doorstep, and they were incredibly fresh and chewy. Yum. I plan to order many more as Easter treats!",1
"These have minty chocolate in them, but it's not too minty, wich is good.  They're a lot like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies in reguard to flavor, but the texture is lighter and crisper.",1
"I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!",1
"These Salt and Vinegar Almonds are one of the best snack foods I have ever tasted!  They're just tangy enough to give you a good kick.  Hard to find in my local stores, so I came to Amazon and bought a case  :-)",1
"I'm SO glad I gave these tuo chas a chance!!! I've recently become a huge pu-erh fan, so I've been on the lookout for great pu-erh that won't cost me a leg. I keep hearing that tuos don't usually have great quality, that often tea dust and poor quality leaves are compressed to make the ""nests"" (and yes, I've tasted those often enough to say it's true), but that's not the case here. In fact, this has become one of my favorite pu-erhs. (I've also tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021I8F60"">Rishi Tea Pu-erh Classic, 3.2-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>, which I thought was bound to be better simply because it was loose leaf, but that is not the case. I was not impressed... this one is much tastier.)<br /><br />I can get 3 huge mugs (each with a strong brew) out of 1 little tuo. The 4th one is already too watery, but the 3rd is still as strong as I like. This tea made me understand those comments about good pu-erh being ""a mouthful"", thick (I used to wonder what on earth it meant); it is like gulping milk, very interesting experience. I can't really describe the flavor, except to say that it's mellow, sweet, and very yummy. As all pu-erhs, it never gets bitter. To make this taste like heaven, I sometimes add a little bit of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N749GY"">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> for some chocolate/vanilla/orange flavor - perfection in a cup!!!<br /><br />I was wondering how many tuos actually fit into one of these little tins... and the answer is, quite a lot of them! That was another good surprise.",1
"Peppers arrived in good shape, sourced from Olive Nation - checked the weight before opening because of other reviewer's concern and it was dead on at 8oz net, and the aroma/taste were very good.  There are a few black centers still but it's much better quality than the local Asian grocery at roughly the same price.  As someone else noted 8oz. is a LOT of pepper -- it may take a while to use all this up.",1
Can't get the Megas here... Combine with one of the Anchor Hocking Heritage Hill glass jars with lids on Amazon for a great gift!,1
I have Celiac disease and am thrilled that General Mills has started labeling so many of their products that are gluten free. The Chocolate Chex were originally a purchase I made for myself because of the gluten free status but my entire family (who don't have Celiac) loves them! I have to buy 3 or 4 boxes at a time and hide 2 for myself!,1
Very satisfied.  It was delivered earlier than expected.  I bought this so my elderly mother wouldn't have to mess with loose coffee grounds.  She loves the convenience and the taste.  I will be ordering more.,1
"I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.  I certainly recommend it.",1
I got them when on sale so better price than off-brands. They taste great my daughter loves them. Toddler must have! Get the off-brand though like parentschoice or up and up if not on sale though cuz they are the same thing taste just the same just not as pretty packaging.,1
"I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat.",1
"Because this is the best trap, I bought a second one.<br /><br />I bought one of these a couple of years ago and it worked perfectly, so I just bought another.  I also bought one that is another brand.  So now I have three traps set.  I'm finally whacking those little monsters!<br /><br />The price was good and it arrived quickly.  It works well, and based on the old one, it will last a long time.",1
This SUPERFOOD is very good. I enjoy it with vanilla rice milk and have been adding a scoop of ground flaxseed meal. This is a great morning drink that gets me going. I would defiantly recommend this as it is full of nutrients and tastes very good!,1
"(Horrible title, I know)<br />I just received my package of two boxes of these little potato-y sweets. These were suppose to be for a little St. Patty's Day potluck at work, but unfortunately the party was cancelled due to not many people wanting to contribute. However I'll still bring one box to work.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the smell. That wonderful cinnamon smell that makes me instantly think of Christmas. Second was the size, which surprised me a little. They were smaller than I thought they were, slightly smaller than a golf ball. When I opened a box the potato sweets felt a bit hard when I gently squeezed them, but they gave very easily when I bit down.<br />The flavor.... It reminded me of a mix between a macaroon and a snickerdoodle. It was WONDERFULLY sweet (but not too sweet), soft, and with a light crunchiness from the coconut.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend Oh Ryan's Irish Potatoes, and not just for St. Patty's Day. Get them anytime of the year! They're 100% worth it.",1
"This is a very nice, hot, authentic rub - not a marinade.  It will do 3-4 lbs easily enough.  Personally, I think that the rub turns out better if you are able to baste with a sauce or marinade while cooking.  I like the rub better than Helen's jerk marinade, but I think a better option is the two together.",1
"I've been using Davidson's Decaf Spiced Raspberry tea bags to make iced tea for over 15 years.  I use half regular decaf tea and half flavored.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm, delicious!",1
"I like peppermint candies anyway, and these are great, plus come in a real nice tin.  One thing a lot of people don't know about Altoids is, if you have breathing issues, often times sucking on an Altoid or two will help you breathing - and I think that's much better than using one of those inhalers - but I'd buy them anyway.",1
"My wife and I have relied on Meyenberg for goat milk for many years, and though we normally buy it refrigerated, when in the US, we also purchase it in powdered form when traveling abroad, usually for several months out of the year. I was recently unable to purchase it in its powdered form from the Meyenberg supplier on Amazon, as it was out of stock, so I opted for the evaporated milk cans.  It's still very good, though for easy transportation powdered milk is hard to beat, as I find the evaporated milk a bit bulky and thus more expensive to ship abroad.  On the other hand, the drawback with powdered milk is, once it is opened, the milk powder becomes harder to dissolve the longer it is kept . . . that's the compromise.  Still, my wife and I are happy to have the option.",1
My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig. I've tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite.  Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter.  Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it.  Found it at Amazon for the same price.,1
"once in a while 'they' come out with a flavor that makes a great punch and all around beverage. this is one of those times. 3 packages of Pineapple Kool-aid, two and 1/2 cups sugar and 2 cups of Orange juice, really makes a nice punch for a hot day. good for freezer pops also. '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZEBMO"">Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Pina Pineapple Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.14-Ounce Envelopes (Pack of 96)</a><br /><br />I only wish they would bring back the kiwi-lime, that was awesome in a punch, like liquid Skiddles'",1
"Liking to play in the kitchen and trying different recipes, I tried the Southeastern Mills Brown Gravy for a English Roast that was slow cooked. The flavor is so unique and out of the ordinary. Great on meat loafs, beef tips and noodles (or mashed potatoes). All my friends who have tried it say it the best they ever had",1
"At only 100 calories each & tasting just like snickers bars, these are always in my pantry for a quick chocolate fix!!!",1
"When I first tried this product, I wasn't thrilled...the sauce was a bit gritty and clumpy...and REALLY strong.<br /><br />But I've found the solution.  Add extra dairy substitute (I use unsweetened rice milk) to thin the sauce out a bit and stir CONSTANTLY to prevent clumping.  Add 1/2 a bag of frozen peas to the pasta when cooking...and then once it's completed...refrigerate it overnight, and microwave the next day.  That is the secret.  The sauce has time to rest and becomes creamy and develop a mild, cheesy flavor.  I really recommend this!",1
I am very happy with my Ghiradelli Chocolate Sauce. It tastes great & was a good price. Seller was great on shipping too- price & speed. Received my sauce fast. YAY! Thanks so much!,1
My four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats. He is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these. They smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at. They are made with good ingredients. No meat byproducts or corn! AND they are made in the USA which is definite plus. I will continue to get these for my pup.,1
"McCann's Irish Oatmeal has more texture, fiber and flavor than your garden variety oatmeal; I think it's the best. I like to add dried fruit and raisins to it sometimes, or you can throw in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg if you like. By the way, I can verify that it's true what they say about oatmeal's ability to lower cholesterol; my total cholesterol dropped some 30+ pts this winter (yes we had winter here in FL). Thank you McCann's, for a great product!",1
If you like dark strong coffee-- this is the one for you.  I have been buying this coffee for two years and love it,1
"I sprinkle a pack of this over my greek yogurt in the morning for breakfast! It makes a satisfying, filling and nutritious meal. (and fast)",1
"this stuff did not do much to help me make more milk. it did however make my boobs look bigger. also me and my daughter smelled like maple syrup. i could even smell it when i went to restroom. if i wiped under my arms, i smelled maple syrup. i took 4 capsules every 8 hours. i used the gnc fenugreek though. i am waiting on my mother's milk tea to come in the mail. i will be writing a review on that when i get it. hope that works better.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I have noticed that when I take fenugreek, or drink mother's milk tea, my daughter gets baby acne(really small cluster of bumps on her back and legs, nothing too scary). I also noticed that when I take less fenugreek pills with mother's milk tea, it does increase my supply. it takes about 1-2 days to increase it. i would go from 3 1/2( 1 1/2on the right and 2 on the left) ounces in one session all together from both breasts. to filling a 4 ounce bottle almost to the top in one session. this makes me very happy. the only problem is that it still gives my daughter baby acne, so i use every now and then. HOPE THAT HELPS!!!",1
"They are safe for my daughter's restricted diet, and the rest of the family loves them too.  Their small size is great for snacking, and each bag has many servings.  They are a great buy... we're already on our second case!",1
single serves or a little highter but to me worth it because i can make one cup at a time,1
"The Really Raw honey brand is really good.  I'm trying to lead a more healthy lifestyle and heard about the benefits of eating raw/unprocessed honey.  Growing up, I never liked honey - even though it was in a cute bear-shaped package.  So, I doubted I would like it 30 years later.  Boy was I wrong.  The Really Raw honey is wonderful - great texture, smell, and taste.  This is the ""dip your spoon straight into the jar"" kind of good.",1
"My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!",1
I have tried 2 other matcha powders and this is the best so far. It is also the cheapest one if you buy it in this package. The package is beautiful and seals very nicely between uses. It also tastes pretty darn good (at least compared to the other 2 I have tried!).,1
Easy to use and an effective probiotic.  I could make 49 six ounce jars from one packet so it is very price effective.,1
"The only suggestion that I would pass on is that I refrigerate after opening because it takes me awhile (a few weeks) to go through the bag.<br />Also, I decided that they were cheaper over time than even Costco's cashews which are a bargain.  That is because Costco uses more oil and so they are more of a grabber.  But these have that good cashew flavor.",1
"This is the  first energy drink I've tried.  The 16 ounce can has 2 servings at 130 calories each - so - it's a great candy bar snack substitute.<br /><br />No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very delicious, perfect afternoon pick me up. It's lightly carbonated, tastes fruity and there's no added sugar.<br /><br />I'm really tired of coffee by noon and No Fear is a refreshing change.<br />Vitamin C, B6, B12, Selenium and Taurine are a few of the ingredients I wouldn't get in my coffee!<br /><br />Thumbs up to No Fear, Super Energy Supplement.",1
"I'm very pleased with my Spry Sugar Free Cinnamon Gum purchase, the price is good, the product arrived undamaged in a timely manner. This is an excellent replacement for the Altoids Sugar Free Cinnamon Chewing Gum which is no longer available.",1
"A very crunchy ginger snap, with just the right amount of zing. A very versitile cookie, pie crust, toppings, or just eat right out of bag.An excellent wheat free, alternate for those missing the good old crunch of a spicy cookie.",1
I had this for lunch today and loved it.  My only complaint is that after cooking I found it a little too watery.  Next time I will add a tiny bit less water and I think it will be perfect.,1
"This stuff is wonderful, but don't overdo it!  Seriously, a 1/4 teaspoon tops in your paprikas.",1
"These treats are probably fine for a bigger dog.  My little dog did not especially like them, I had to break them in half.",1
"This is the first food product I ever purchased on Amazon.com.  The item came sealed and in perfect shape - I would have not accepted anything else.  I bought the 28oz bottle for $6.50.  I add this to soups and Chinese dishes which are just not spicy/hot enough.  This product is a little sweet, has a strong garlic flavor, has a vibrant and natural red color, but needs to be tasted to be judged - Taste is ultimately subjective.  Look at the ingredient list to get a better idea of what this product may taste like to you.  One of the real benefits:  You can add a little to a lot of food and still enjoy its taste.  One can use this as a dipping sauce, because its consistency is not watery - Before using, make sure to shake it a little.  I bought this around a week and a half before writing this review and the product's expiration date is in 2013.",1
We buy the teenies for our dog.  She only weighs 8 pounds and absolutely adores these edible bones.  These bones are her absolute favorite treats.,1
"The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUPSS"">Brewer's Yeast</a> is for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.",1
"This is the best salt ever.  Use it as a finishing salt at the table.  It's crunchy and not too salty.  (Read that, you can get LOTS of crunch.)  I will never use another salt.",1
"These sparkling juices strike the perfect compromise between soda and water.  They are sweet enough to satisfy the kids, but not loaded with sugar and chemicals like soda.  The 8.4 ounce cans are a great size for my middle school and high school children to bring for lunch.",1
"I didn't have high hopes when I got this, but was very pleasantly surprised.  It's not a strong coffee, but it does have fantastic flavor.  I am definitely getting this again.",1
"My 3 hounds (2 small, one large) have one of these after breakfast every morning.  They know the routine and go stare at the box as soon as they come in from breakfast.  Just the right size snack and it cleans their teeth and breath.  Good stuff.",1
I really like the flavor of Stash's Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea.  I especially like it in the evening when I sit down to read and relax!,1
These really hit the spot.  They used to be at Restoration Hardware at Christmas and we doled them out very stingily.  Great to have them in bulk!<br /><br />Kamir the Large Brown Cat<br />kamirthelargebrowncat.blogspot.com,1
"Well, this drink was surprisingly tasty. The reason it was surprising because there is no sugar added. It's ""100% juice carbonated"". It was like drinking a soda but it was a drink of juice that is carbonated. This would be a good drink if you want a healthy drink that is carbonated.<br /><br />Now I'm curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better. However, I do have to say if you're expecting something extremely sweet, this is not the drink to get. You may want to go buy Kool-Aid for that. This drink has a natural taste to it. I can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine. I wish the tangerine flavor was stronger, because I like tangerine more than orange, but considering the fact that there is no sugar, it's a good drink.",1
"My whole life I drank Coke never Pepsi. I took the Pepsi challenge in the 80's and could tell instantly which one was Coke. I couldn't stand diet Coke (the after taste!) Through the years I tried pretty much every natural cola out there, (my husband's idea) and it varied from I couldn't stand it, to just not liking it, that is until Virgil's. Virgil's cola has done what I didn't think possible, it has replaced Coke for me. It is now the only cola I drink, even when we go out to dinner, I no longer order Coke. Truly this is good stuff and nothing on the market comes close to it.<br />I would recommend their cream soda, root beer and black cherry soda as well. All are very good and all are made with sugar!<br /><br />And if you want the best root beer float it doesn't get better than Virgil's Root Beer with Breyer's Natural Vanilla with Vanilla Beans Ice Cream! Now I have to go make one. Enjoy!",1
I purchased six bags of the Greenies and were very happy with them.  The price was great and so was the product.  Carol,1
This tastes great on chicken and shrimp and is very easy to use - just like Shake 'n' Bake but so much tastier! It is not too sweet or too spicy.,1
This is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there!  I'm so glad it comes in K-Cups!  And I'm glad it is so inexpensive!,1
"First and foremost, shame on me. I thought these were going to taste like dry, boring, bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share.",1
It's just fantastic to be able to purchase these on Amazon and have them arrive at my doorstep!  I was unable to find these in my STATE after becoming seriously attached to these while living in S. Cal.  Yum!  Yum!,1
"Our Shiba loves these. Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.<br /><br />We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower. However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10%-12% per unit.",1
"If you are addicted to potato chips, or just love snacks, you may want to grab some of these.  I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.  The flavor is excellent and they are crisp and fresh packed in what looks like a foil package.  At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.  Enjoy !",1
"Great deal.  If your household goes through large amounts of cereal, it's better then purchasing in the store.  Boxes have always arrived in good condition, and are a great deal with subscribe and save.",1
"I love these crackers, I am totally addicted. I occasionally buy them from a local natural food store, but I was paying more. The only thing with having crackers delivered by mail (or UPS) is the break issue. In each package there were several cracked or broken crackers.<br /><br />Other than that, they are gluten free, and delish!<br />My whole family loves them.",1
I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.,1
"We have owned our Keurig since before Christmas, and have sampled many of the k-cups through the 5-cup sampler packs.  After all of the tasting the Timothy's Italian is my favorite blend.  It is crisp, robust, and has a coffee-shop freshness every time I make it.  And what a great surprise that I can purchase this coffee through the subscribe & save program on Amazon!  I just signed up for automatic delivery, because I have not and don't expect to tire of the great taste of the Timothy's Italian Blend. (Try some of their other blends, especially the Fair Trade.)",1
We started getting these almonds when it was recommended to substitute the cocoa covered almonds for chocolate covered almonds for health and weight issues.  They have been a hit and success in our family.,1
"I have been eating Biscoes Sugar Wafers for at least 60 years.  I was heart broken when Nabisco stoped making these delicious treats.  Now as I understand, they are bing made in Canada, wonderful.  They arrived within a week and arrived fresh and as tasty as I remember.  I will acontinue to order them through Amazon as long as they carry them. Bravo Canada.",1
"Great taste, not very strong, definitely not bland. These 7.x gram pods fit perfectly on the Senseo, you may need to tap on it once the pod is on the holder because the pod is slightly smaller in foot print which causes the coffee to be ""more piled up"", so you just tap it slightly to disperse it more evenly; the Senseo pods cover up the whole circumference of the holder so the same amount of coffee is more loose. TIP: do not buy 12 gram pods for your Senseo, they will definitely NOT work. There are also 10 gram pods and these I am uncertain if they will fit, but I seriously doubt it.",1
"The description says ""ferret treats"" but the packaging says ""for dogs, cats and ferrets."" I give this daily to my 23 year old cat as a treat. Also to coax her to eat when she's not so interested in food, I crumble it on top of her food. She also likes their Chicken flavored Daily Dream Treats. A cat portion of either is only 1/2  a ""cookie"" so the bag lasts for months. Keep in the fridge.",1
"I love Tully's House Blend K-Cups! I have several dozen other flavors and always find myself reaching for Tully's House Blend. It is just right when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. Strong, bold, but not strong enough to make me so hyper that people run from me! I'm about to order more right now and thought I would stop and make a review while I'm thinking about it.",1
"Dr. Johnson found oats only suitable for horses and Scotsmen. But they are good for the rest of us too, and McCann's Irish Oatmeal is the best. Bring four cups of water to the boil, add one cup of oatmeal and simmer gently for 30 (yes 30) minutes. Add milk and honey, and you have a biblically good breakfast, nutritious, delicious. Refill packages are available for the handsome tin.",1
"When I went to Cancun for vacation the flavor of the meats and poultry had this distinct flavor that I truly enjoyed. When I came home I researched to find the flavor so I could make it at home. This is it and it gives great flavor to Steak and chicken. You don't need the entire package to marinade your food. I add lemon juice, salt and olive oil - Mix and maybe half or a quarter of the spice...and your food will have an authentic Yucatan flavor. Mild and not overbearing !!",1
"My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!",1
"I use this coconut oil on my face and body as a moisturizer and I love it!  The smell is wonderful (yes, it smells like coconut).  It arrived as a solid but if I put it in the sun or set it in some warm water it becomes a liquid oil. I find I can put it on my skin in either liquid or ""solid"" states because even solid it is still very soft.",1
"These are a really good chips, have a Wonderful flavor, not too salty very light taste of garlic and with a hint of other seasonings, I try these these chips with chiken salad and doesn't taste good at all, but with Guacamole or avocado they taste delicious, This is a quality product you will enjoy I higly recommended.",1
Black Tiger K- Cups are awesome. My Wife and I enjoy the coffee. Gonna have to order more. K-Cups<br />arrived on time without a hitch. Good Stuff!!!!!!!!!!,1
"I am new to this product line- I use with the Ultra Shea Smooth Shampoo- I have very thin hair.. It smells great, does a super job conditioning my hair where it is very easy to put a comb through.. Smells great- Hair is super shiny and soft- Love this product line !",1
"I like to drink XO Caf&eacute; neat in a shot glass - no ice, not mixed with other liquor, or not even with coffee. No fuss, no muss. Unlike other coffee liqueurs such as Baileys or Kahl&uacute;a, it's not so sweet and syrupy that it needs to be mixed. I enjoy the deep rich color of XO Caf&eacute; as light reflects off it, displaying amber hues toward the edge of the glass, making it even more pleasing to the eye than it was in the bottle.<br /><br />A sniff of this and you can't help but detect the predominant coffee aroma. But breathe in deeply and the smoky, woody notes of tequila come through. Why would anyone want to mask such deliciousness in a mixed drink? Now, if you prefer perhaps more of the tequila and less of the coffee, I would suggest what is called a ""Bullfighter"" - half a shot of good quality silver tequila with half a shot of XO Caf&eacute;. But for me, it's all about the coffee. And I couldn't be more pleased with XO Caf&eacute;.<br /><br />I think what surprised me the most was the surprisingly dry finish. There's just a hint of sweetness, but like a good dark chocolate where the rich chocolate is not masked by sugar, the light sweetness of XO Caf&eacute; does not crowd out the flavor of coffee. It's just enough to make it luxuriously smooth, with a balanced medium-weight body, highlighted by notes of tequila in the background. There's a slight burn, but not so much that I feel like I'm throwing back tequila shots like a college student. It's more sophisticated and refined, and as such, one shot of this after dinner is more than satisfying for me.",1
"It's no wonder the Incas ate quinoa!  It's a powerhouse of healthy vitamins & minerals, high in fiber, tastes good and cooks up much faster than rice.  I am glad to keep this in stock in my kitchen, especially since it is gluten free.<br /><br />Since first reviewing this product I've seen more press on this amazing grain.  It is being touted as a superfood and rightly so.  I recommend keeping opened bags of quinoa in the refrigerator.  I had learned the grain contains oils, thus you want to be sure to keep the product chilled to be sure it doesn't become spoiled.  Enjoy this delicious and healthy grain in soups, salads, under chicken or seafood.  There are so many great uses to incorporate quinoa into a balanced diet.",1
This product is getting hard to find and I was so happy that Amazon found it for me.  It is the only product that doesn't come right back up from my fussy felines.  I have been using it for the last three years and am so happy to have been able to locate it on Amazon.,1
"ALL I CAN SAY  IS ,  THIS IS THE BEST RICE MILK EVER MADE.  I USE IT IN MASH POTATOES, CERAL, PUDDING, CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, POTATEO SOUP,.  MAKES OUTSTAND SMOOTHIES, .  THE RICE MILK TASTE  SO RICH AND CREAMING,  I USE IT TO MAKE NON-DAIRY ICING,<br /><br />THE ONLY SAD THING IS THAT  WE TRAVEL ALOT AND I WISH THEY HAD THE RICE MILK IN POWDER FORM!  IF THEY DO PLEASE LET US KNOW WE WOULD BUY IT.  WE TRAVEL  AND WE ALWAY LOOK FOR <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FYI8DK"">Pacific Natural Foods Rice Non-Dairy Beverage, Vanilla, 32-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />WE ARE VERY PICKY ABOUT THE TASTE OF FOOD AND THIS ONE TASTE BETTER THAN ANYTHING ON THE MARKET.",1
"Each bag contains exactly 8 gummy bears, and is 50 calories. I love that I can have just one but don't feel bad about going back for a second if the craving wasn't satisfied.",1
"Anyone can do hot, but this sauce also tastes great! Most hot sauces taste like vinegar, but this one tastes like fresh peppers. It's got great kick, so a little goes a long way. My grocery stopped selling it, so I've had to venture online to find it.",1
"Disclaimer: My mother-in-law spoiled her sons by making them homemade pasta any time they wanted it.  It was only when my DH went of to college that he had to experience the horror of boxed pasta.  Over the years he has realized that even the best of wives does not make homemade macaroni after a long day at work, and that he needs to eat boxed pasta.  (arrrgh)<br /><br />But there's boxed pasta and some stuff that calls itself boxed pasta that is decidedly inferior.  DeCecco is about as close to homemade as you are going to get without making it yourself.<br /><br />The spaghetti is a nice, mid weight string of pasta, with a good texture, bouncing back a bit when you bite it, and having a firm semolina texture. Little or no starch bleeds off in the water, and the pasta only absorbs enough to be cooked, no mushy macaroni here! Each variety has a preferred cooking time; if you follow that with a timer, you'll always be right.<br /><br />This spaghetti is a little pricey in the grocery store, which has to buy it from an Italian importer in relatively small quantities. Because of its price, it's unlikely that it turns over quickly and you aren't likely to get the best DeCecco around. The DeCecco Spaghetti from Amazon must turn over very quickly, because I always get very fresh product for a much smaller sum than in my market. Having to buy five boxes is no hardship for us -- we could buy three times that and still eat it all up in no time.<br /><br />If you haven't tried imported Italian macaroni, do yourself a favor: buy a case of this spaghetti and treat yourself with the lightest sauce you have.  Put a teaspoon of virgin olive oil in the boiling water to minimize sticking, and cook for the exact length of time suggested on the box.  Add sauce as soon as you finish draining.<br /><br />You won't believe that this is the same kind of food that they sell as macaroni at your local market. Be sure to make plenty for everyone.",1
"I got this for my mom's birthday.  I chose standard shipping to Hawaii and the product was delivered 3 days after I placed the order.  My mom has been undergoing treatment for cancer so between the liquor candies (which she also loves) and this tea basket, I chose the tea basket.  She was impressed by the packaging and complimented that the amount of food items were just the right amount for her.  Thank you for making her day special :)",1
"I really really like this cereal because it's very filling and doesn't have added sugars like most cereals on the market.  I love how it is very nutrient dense and holds me over for hours.  It is somewhat bland with a nice hint of cinnamon, but I don't like things that are overly sweet.  I just wish it came in a larger package and wasn't so expensive.  I have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup with each serving, but it didn't last me more than about 8 days =/",1
"I just tried these recently and I can't get enough of them now.  They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza...just chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce.  Haven't tried it yet, but they seem like they'd be REALLY good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the oven.<br /><br />They seem to be a bit more expensive than other Jack Link stuff, but so worth it.  Om nom nom nom nom",1
I am very satisfied with the product. It arrived on time and was just what I expected. The items were fresh and well packaged.,1
"The Sumatra Blend is my favorite variety offered by Senseo!  It is smooth, and very bold!  I've always prefered a dark roast and this one tops my list!",1
"I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C"">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS"">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.",1
"First drank this tea at a great restaurant in Manhattan.  Wonderful, strong flavor.  First rate product, and Amazon's price is excellent.",1
"I will come clean to you, here and now, and admit that I do have ONE addiction.  That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice.  For starters, it isn't too sweet. Secondly, it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor.  Plus, the blurb on the side of the box is right.  Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion, and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it.  [Or is this purely psychological?]  It's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat, but don't want to feel guilty afterwards.  It's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach, or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days!",1
"this is one of my favorites, if not, the favorite.  It is easy, fast, and healthy especially to take to work for lunch.",1
"I have been using Cytomax for over 20 years for endurance cycling and racing.  I have tried others, but I keep coming back to cytomax.",1
My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :),1
"Wow...this stuff is great!  I use it instead of butter on my bread and baked potatoes.  You can also use it to make chocolate.  And, a great skin moisturizer.  I will definitely order more.",1
If you like vanilla then you will love these. They taste pretty good!,1
"This product is wondeful for a ""In a hurry"" fondue. I have used it at several of my own parties only to recieve compliments. It's important to melt it BEFORE you put it in your fondue maker in the microwave on high for about 3 minutes. I think it is very good and if used properly and not just heated over a wimpy flame can be a hit at any party.",1
"This is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten - and I've tried many brands.  McCann's is more like a meal than a bowl of cereal.  The tins are also great for long-term storage so I keep them coming on a subscription basis.  The Quick and Easy variety is also delicious and cooks up quickly.  Cooking several servings at once is simple.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and then add 2 cups of oatmeal, reduce heat and cover for 5 minutes stirring often. After cooling, refrigerate and enjoy as a cold snack throughout the day or nuke and enjoy hot. Add whatever treats you enjoy most.  Splenda and blueberries are my favorite additives.  I get about 90 miles per bowl.",1
"I love these. Perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar, and the pita seems almost buttery (although the product is dairy free). They're just so yummy. Several reviewers mention the small portion size, but it's a 200 calorie snack if you eat the whole 1.5oz serving. So, no, it's not huge, but I think it's a perfectly portioned afternoon snack, especially when you compare it to the popular 100 calorie snacks that just don't cut it!",1
"I only write reviews when I really appreciate the quality of a product...as you can see from my previous reviews.  This is a great buy!  I'm the only girl working in an office of 9... I love all of our guys...they're like family..so I enjoy when they come by my desk and say hello.  The best part..is when they see a big basket filled with all their favorite candies.. their faces light up like little boys.  It's adorable..and very worth the price of this 5lb bag of candy.  I order 2 every time, and they last about a month.  Great Buy!",1
"After I got my Keurig coffee maker and tried some of the brews available in K-Cups, I thought I might have to settle for a less bold coffee.  Based on some reviews on Amazon.com I went with Coffee People Jet Fuel and I've been very pleased for a couple of years now.  I do the subscribe and save option, which is great for me and a pretty good deal (at least for K-Cups).",1
"I came home tonight and was ecstatic to see this arrived.  I put hot sauce on pretty much everything and habanero started to loose its umph some time ago.  After preparing some spaghetti, I turned the bottle upside down and tried to shake the paste-like sauce into my bowl.  Excited, I began to smack the bottle.  I probably knocked 6-7 drops into my bowl.  Then I read the bottle, which belatedly instructed me to use one drop.  About 4-5 mins into dinner it hit me; my lips went numb and I began to sweat.  Shortly thereafter my nose began to run.  I went a little bit lighter on the next bowl- like 3 drops.  This was still extremely hot- I continued to sweat and became a little dizzy.  I don't see this stuff bringing a grown man down.  However, it is a half hour later and I think that I am high.  I am also afraid of what tomorrow might bring.  Although this is a must have for those who like hot sauce, you should seriously be weary... it is indeed hot!",1
These caramels are great and have a flavor unlike any others I have tried.<br /><br />A little pricey but worth it in my opinion.,1
"I have always liked flavored coffee, but often they are acidic or bitter with fake flavor. This coffee is very smooth (no bitterness) with a really rich chocolate scent.  Tastes great with a dab of cream :)  If you like chocolate and coffee, this is definitely worth trying, I know I will be getting more.",1
"This popcorn is amazing, especially with Discount Tommy's popcorn poppers.  The popcorn pops evenly and tastes absolutely marvelous.  Can't go wrong with this popcorn.  Best of all I have used. I even gave some away to relatives for Christmas it is so delicious.",1
I am a fan of Jelly Belly and I love the the different flavors. It was sssoooo gggoooddd. And I will purchase some more in the future. Thanks,1
Born in New York but great Southern cooking. Very difficult to find in stores but dont hesitate to order online and with free shipping the price shouldnt stop you. These Lima's are slow cooked with Bacon Smoke flavor and melt in your mouth. I love all lima beans but these are my very favorite. Eat them slowly. Enjoy the taste.,1
"I choose this item because of my wellness journey I started back in 2008. I try to eat low fat and remain conscientious of the earth and all its inhabitants. Back to Nature did a great job with the design of this box. It looks great from its simple earthy color to the feel of the cardboard. Staying true to nature you won't find a lot of frills built into this box.<br /><br />It looks like the item is retailing for upwards of $3.70 very comparable to what most crackers are selling for. Inside the box you get four sleeves of crackers with seven crackers in each. The crackers have the perfect name ""Golden Honey Oat Graham"" you can see the oats and taste the honey and graham. In each bit you get the gentle sweetness of honey balanced with the taste of graham we've come to enjoy.<br /><br />Good news....<br />I can eat these crackers without all the guilt of other brands because Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham crackers are made w/out refined sugar, trans fat and hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />Bad news...<br />Be careful exercise portion control because its very easy to eat the whole sleeve or even the box they are so good and wholesome.<br />Yummy<br /><br />Missy",1
"I have bought Blueberry Pop-Tarts from Amazon twice now.  This was my first purchase from AMAZON and I found it to be so easy to order from them.  My husband loves pop-tarts, but he doesn't like them frosted because that is too much sugar.  I can only find the strawberry in the stores, but his favorite is blueberry.  The closest store that come up on the internet that carried them was a mile from my home; however when I went to get them, there were none.  I asked to have a case held for me when they came in, and after three months, I figured I'd never get them.  The next store was 75 miles away.  So I tried Amazon.  Very easy shopping.  My husband is happy, and we share them with our son's family.  Hope they keep carrying the NOT FROSTED pastries.",1
"I come from the land of good tea and coffee and I buy my tea from the States, I think that says enough.<br />Highly recommended tea. Very good taste!",1
"I bought this tea without reading any reviews or any knowledge of the Ceylon Tea Company and I'm happy I did.<br />First off, the price is very reasonable for a tea from Sri Lanka. Second, free shipping is offered for this product, reducing the cost even more. But the most important point about this tea is the taste, that is why I'm writing this review.<br />When I opened the package, the smell of bergamot and tea was great. The bags come in a foil package inside of a box, they are not individually wrapped. I boiled (not quite a boil... probably around 200 degrees) up some water and let the tea bag sit for 3 minutes. What I got was very aromatic, nice and dark and the taste was outstanding. What a treat. I have tried different steep times, and really, this tea is hard to mess up.<br />I highly recommend this Earl Grey and will definitely buy again.",1
"Cheaper than buying in a store(if you could find it in the store), comes right to your door,and free shipping!!What better way to shop! Don't buy from other online sites, Amazon is the best!",1
"These products have been great for my Rottweilers.  They actually last a long time and the ""kids"" enjoy them.  I have used Nyabone products for over 5 years.",1
i love this tea for dieting its the best i will always purchase this tea for me and my family,1
We absolutely LOVE all the Plum Organics Pouches.  They are awesome for lunch boxes.  I am a parent of 3 1/2 yr. old twins. One cannot process fresh fruits and veggies but with these products I don't have to worry.  He will now eat five different varieties.  The only complaint I have is that they keep saying the item is no longer available for subscribe and save then one day later it becomes available at a higher price.,1
"My favorite coffee. Have been drinking it for years, then the local supermarkets stopped carrying it. Amazon saved me! Arrived in good condition, have set up monthly deliveries.",1
"For some reason my miniature/toy poodle loves fishy foods (especially sneaking into the cats food), so I was excited to find these fish recipe sticks. Made in USA is a huge must for my dogs treats after the Chinese treat issues, and I was happy to find this company offers that. My poodle is about 8lbs and this lasted her about 1/2-1 hour of chewing. More known brands (those you would find in every grocery store) usually get abandoned by my dog after a couple minutes when she realizes she doesn't care for the taste.<br /><br />An issue I've had with other products and my dogs are upset tummys if they eat too much. These sticks have caused no issues at all!<br /><br />I greatly recommend this product for those who care about quality.",1
"I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem. These would work for about a week, and then the problem would return. My dog groomer suggested that there might be a food allergy involved.  I looked on Amazon.com and saw the ""Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions"" dog food. I noted that the primary ingredent was lamb instead of corn...I ordered some and the first day I fed it to my dogs, it worked!!! My little dacshund Sugar had no more diarrhea or sickness from that day forward. I feed it to all my pets and I believe that they are actually happier now.  I am too!!!!",1
I love this seasoning and use it almost everyday. So much cheaper than in the stores. I hope Amazon continues to sell Goya products.,1
"See my review on the Samurai Chai Mate. The two combined is fabulous.<br /><br />One more thing -- we have found that you can use the loose leaves (we just leave them in the tea basket) for several cups of tea with the same effect. So while it's a pit pricey, it's well worth it, particularly if you reuse the leaves.",1
"Excellent not only do the treats clean your cats teeth,but are full of nutrients and healthy for your cat.I only have to open the bag slightly before my 5 cats come runing and begging at my feet.",1
"Earth' Best suits our 6 month daughter. She enjoys this cereal and it's easily digested. As one of the reviewers commented, very few cereals are gluten free, and this is one of them.",1
"My wife uses San Marzanos in her tomato sauces. They cost a little more than the regular canned tomatoes, but we think there is more flavor. These are very rich and delicious. I don't know what these cost in your store, but I figured it out to a $1 savings per can by buying them in bulk, and that's off the CHEAPEST San Marzanos in the store that are actually grown in the USA. These are authentic from Italy. With Prime shipping and the amount of tomato sauce we make, this is a no brainer for us.<br /><br />The cans arrived in good condition.",1
Best chocolate spread EVER! If you need a pick me up toast a croissant and spread some of this on!!! Coffee along side this snack is extra yum!,1
"Great product. Very versatile and useful especially for low carb eating. This product is pasteurized for safety, too. The price is best for the case on Amazon.",1
With 7 dogs this is a constant favorite they always bark for! So far they only go up to 5 woofs so that is the amount of stars this product gets  ;)<br />First I hold up the treat... then the drool... then the happy (I love you) tail wag... then the smile on your face! Worth every cent!,1
"Best sugar-free syrup I've ever tasted - it's all I use. Why Amazon doesn't put this on ""Prime"" membership shipping, I have no idea.",1
I love this k cup.  Added whip cream and it is heavenly.  Thanks Grove Square for making this great k cup.  Nice aroma and great taste.  My bf also likes the French Vanilla.,1
"Finally I have found a decaf coffee that tastes like coffee and not a watered down version of reg coffee. Tastes great, full bodied and no after taste. Even with a little cream and sweetner it still tastes like coffee.",1
"Wonderful black tea with a touch of natural cardamom flavor.  I use an Ekobrew Refillable K-Cup <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">Ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> with my Keurig to brew one tea bag for a tall glass of tea.  I stir in some sugar and pour this tea over ice.  It's lovely cold.  I have not tried it hot yet.  I don't think I'll ever get sick of it, and that's a good thing since there are 100 tea bags!",1
"If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!",1
"We try to use olive oil for as many purposes as possible because of the health benefits.  The best olive oils are first pressed/cold pressed because there is less processing involved and the oil has higher levels of the good stuff, plus it is generally of a lighter nature with a less pungent taste.<br /><br />The latter is particularly important when you are cooking for picky little kids.  And it's one of the reasons we use Bertolli's extra-light.  This extra-light oil is nearly tasteless.  HOW TASTELESS?  I use it all the time in cake recipes.  It absolutely makes no difference to the taste.<br /><br />Pam T",1
This is the best decaf!!  I cannot have caffeine but I love my morning cup of coffee so I've tried many kinds.  This is my favorite.,1
"I first had this item in South Africa on a visit and fell in love with them, now my kids can try them as well.",1
I am a vegetarian and I feel bad that I never have any real meat to give to my animals as treats. They get so excited whenever others bring chicken or turkey into the house. My cats LOVE these treats. The only ingredient is natural USDA inspected chicken breast so I feel good about them eating these. They are marketed for dogs but they break up really easy into cat sized pieces.,1
Excellent product with perfect customer service.. I have been and still am placing orders.. The kids and I love them. Ordered more to give out on Halloween,1
"I have always liked this tea but have not been able to find it anywhere.  I was so glad to see I could receive it through Amazon.  As usual, Amazon comes through.",1
"A refreshing blend of green, white, and herbal teas.  Low caffeine.  I love the idea of white tea but find it incredibly bland.  Mixing it up with herbs, rooibos, and jasmine green tea makes it wonderful.  Can steep the same cup about four times.  Very high quality and incredibly tasty.  I like it plain or sweetened with steevia or honey.",1
"My two little little dogs can only eat grain-free kibbles.  Their stomachs are very sensitive.  Besides the fact they really like eating the food, it is a healthy choice for them.  It is difficult finding grain-free dry dog food that my dogs will eat.",1
"Husband bought this treat for Mr. Kitty several years ago for Christmas, and we have not been able to be without it since.  If you enjoy demanding yowls near the treat cupboard, I highly recommend this freeze-dried salmon.  It's also nice to be able to make the fur-beasts happy without all the ground up chicken beaks and chemicals.  We love this stuff.  Be warned - it stinks!  The treats are big enough that you can give just one or two treats at a time, and make the bag last.",1
"I have been getting this brand for months now and have been very pleased. I can tell it's good quality coconut milk. If you want the cream to be the texture of whipped cream, do not put the can in the fridge until you're ready to open it. After it goes in the fridge, the cream will become harder due to the temperature.",1
"Want a very unique BBQ sauce, this is it.  On a dare I used it on a pork tenderloin roast having no idea how this combination would work. The result was WOW!",1
"I am accustomed to baking and cooking from scratch.  Since being diagnosed with Celiac Disease, learning to navigate this new dietary highway, and experiencing some dismal failures in the kitchen, I was delighted to find that this product tastes very much like my old cornbread recipe.  I would recommend it highly as my dinner guests seem to enjoy it as much as I.",1
"Consistently delicious, reasonable price. Terrific for snacking, salads etc. I recommended for people who are looking for healthy alternative to traditional snacks.",1
I have never had better chocolate in my life! My box is only two days old and it is 75% gone. My husband helped. I really don't know if this is a blessing or a curse.....normally I have better self control and we are thin and healthy people who never over-indulge. But it's just that good.,1
"What an awesome snack, super easy to make and doesn't disappoint whatsoever. The flavor is totally there, they come out perfectly hot, crispy, light and stays fresh throughout the week..if you are in the mood for something salty, its the ideal snack!  Love these, they are addictive!",1
"I love Tully's coffees. I usually drink French, sometimes Kona, and recently I tried Italian. I thought at the time I had not tasted anything so good! It was my new favorite. It turns out that I need to switch things around. When I do that, they all seem to taste better. The Italian may not be as bold as the French or Kona, but it sure tastes good. I'll be keeping it on hand along with my other favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just had several cups of Tully's Italian Roast K-Cups after being out of it for several months. I remember now why I never wanted to be without it. It's really good.",1
"As the others have stated, this is by far the best masala chai I have tried.  I have been loyal to Rishi for a year now, and while I have found some differences across tin batches (my last 3-pack had a surprising amount of ginger), the taste is always exceptional.  Also, you can follow their harvests here:[...]",1
"I purchased this jam when I was making a multi-tier wedding-style cake for my parent's 60th wedding anniversary party. I used a thin layer between cake layers. The texture is smooth and it spreads easily (at room temperature, give it a good stir first, too). And the taste is outstanding: subtle and not too sweet, and was a terrific balance for the cream cheese icing. I had some leftover, and used it in the morning on toast. Fabulous!",1
"My husband and I like good strong coffee, all day long, we like the smell, color, flavor, etc....except not always the caffeine.  The one thing I don't like is the effect of caffeine on the adrenal glands, so enters Cafix...it's not the same as coffee, but it's a tasty alternative for evenings or to mix with coffee (we'll brew one strong k cup then add Cafix in hot water, essentially making two cups of Half-Caf).",1
"Someone gave me a bar as a gift.  I had no idea it would be this good.  Better than other orange/choc combos, it has a nice crunch to the peel bits. Yum.",1
"I can't drink coffee anymore because I have a caffeine allergy, so I was hoping to find a product that had a similar taste to coffee that I could sip on throughout the day.<br /><br />I've tried a few similar products, but this is the best.  Does it taste like coffee?  Put it this way... if you walked outside your house and saw an elephant doing back flips while drinking Ayurvedic Roast, your focus would remain on the elephant instead of thinking ""what is in my coffee cup?"".<br /><br />I guess a more useful analogy is, it's like a veggie burger vs. a real burger.  You need to treat the two separate.  I like veggie burgers, but I don't order one if I feel like a hamburger.  Temper your expectations with this product and you'll really enjoy it.  I drink it with a little bit of milk and a splenda.  I'm looking forward to trying it iced.",1
"If you are carb conscience, this is a great alternative. We usually make Mac & Cheese with this and it tastes great!",1
This is Top of the line in my book. Absolutly the best bold taste ever!!! I've tried the majority of the bold k-cup coffees and this in my opinion is the Best!!!,1
THE KATRINA STORM WAS MY WIFE AND I MAKING MULTIPLE TYPES OF PASTA ONE SATURDAY WITH BOB'S SEMOLINA FLOUR.  IN A RAVIOLI RECIPE WE ADDED EXTRA BUTTER TO THE DOUGH IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A VERY VERY THIN DOUGH TO ENCAPSULATE THE SIX CHEESE BLEND.  THE SEMOLINA FLOUR WORKED BETTER THAN EXPECTED. ALL THE PASTAS WERE A FANTASTIC HIT AT A FAMILY GET-TOGETHER.,1
"These cookies were pure heaven to eat over the Holidays!!! Thank you, Debbie",1
Everything was good - The product arrived on time and was of good quality. I ordered just a few days before Christmas so I was worried that it wouldn't arrive on time but  luckily all went well.,1
"Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon.",1
"This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.  The only thing I don't understand is the price.  This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart.",1
"I am relatively new to the world of pod coffee, but bought a Bunn My Cafe that I am thrilled with because it brews at the right temperature, easily, and with no ecological waste.  One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.  Most of what I have tried so far are very good, so I have no complaints about any of them, but the Marley One Love coffee pod is perhaps my new favorite.  Wonderfully smooth coffee from Ethiopia, and from the moment you open the wrapper and smell the first whiff of heavenly coffee until you get to drink the freshly brewed cup you will not be disappointed.  This is going to become a regular order for me.  YUM!",1
"Pretty much a repeat of what other's said; one can with minor dent but still usable. Much lower price than I can find locally, and well worth it!",1
"This cornbread tastes just like my made from scratch cornbread. It is a great alternative to toast in the morning. Just warm it in microwave, butter, jelly and you are set to go.",1
These sardines make eating sardines enjoyable as well getting all the omega-3s you could ever need or want and it is noticebly different than the cheaper brands that have less appealing consistency and taste a lot more 'fishy' - a part of this is because the skinless and boneless product is much easier to eat if you don't love over fishy smells and tastes.,1
Loved the chocolate and I don t like raisins or hazelnut in chocolate normally. It starts with the smell ohh so wonderful. loved it from the first bite.  A friend of Mine took a summer school in England and got hooked on them  her husband tasked me to find them.  okay price for the candy but the shipping omg is it out of line.,1
"We have been fans of the PEELED SNACKS product line for years now. We love their line of organic dried fruits. We really appreciate having a snack that not only is delicious but is organic and has no added sugar. Kind of nice that the taste is really high but the calories are really low. Now we have discovered that PEELED SNACKS has a new product: Apple Crunch. Wow! We are in love again! Apple taste with a really fun crunch. Not only a fantastic healthy and delicious snack but really fun to eat! If you take your peeled snacks to the movies, as we do, be sure to chew your apple clusters with your lips closed or everybody in the theater will be looking at you! Maybe you should take a few extra packages to share. Thank you PEELED SNACKS for giving us not only tasty and healthy snacks but clusters that are just fun, fun, fun to eat! We are a senior citizen couple and take great care to eat healthy. We appreciate that the entire PEELED SNACKS line lets us snack while having fun and not having to worry about sugar and our waistlines. We can't wait to see what the folks at PEELED SNACKS have in line for us next. Until then, we have a lot to enjoy!",1
"Ingredient wise.... one of the best dog foods in the market. Of course, a bit on the expensive side. Our 3 dogs love this food.",1
"We give this to my 5-year old daily. He will not eat vegetables so some supplement is necessary. He likes the flavor. I'm not sure of the correlation, but he's rarely sick.",1
"I'm using this flour for my crepes at my creperie, I love it (and my customers love it too). I tried different other brands and I found the taste of this flour more mild.",1
"There are several different versions of Mojo on the market.  This one was particularly good with great flavors.  I used it on a turkey, and it was wonderful!",1
great cookies - none of the sugar garbage and meat by-products - our dog has been loving these for over 5 years.,1
This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.,1
"This is a perfect dark blend of coffee for anyone who loves a good straight up dark roast with out the bitterness and blandness found in other coffees. Not to mention the Folgers select are always a few bucks less then the other premium coffees. For some reason the selection at my local stores has dwindled and they don't have this blend. They only have the funky flavored blends. Don't know if this is from Folgers' end or Walmart's continuing limitation of product selection. Love this coffee, hope is stays around.",1
"This stuff is good!!  That's all I have to say.  Rich chocolate, sweet but not overpowering, with a taste of cinnamon and almonds.  Great combination.",1
"This is great, natural honey.  I use it to make all kinds of things more palatable like honey, cereal, toast, replacing jelly, replacing *all* added sugars, tea, etc.  Great deal on bulk too.  Warning though, this is a *lot* of honey.",1
"A few years ago, I worked in a bed and breakfast and one of my favorite parts was the southern pecan coffee. I have since been trying to find a coffee that is comparable. This is it! Like one of the other reviewers, I don't care for super strong coffee. This coffee has a very smooth flavor and the pecan flavor does not take over the coffee...the two work beautifully together!",1
"I have made one-crust pies with crumb topping, two-crust pies, quiches, and lemon squares with this wonderful, versatile mix.  It works well with my pastry recipes from former wheat-flour-eating days.  The crust is light and fragile, with very little grittiness (less than any other product I have tried thus far.)  Other family members not on a gluten-free diet happily eat items made with this Pie Crust mix and have requested the pies and lemon squares for family gatherings.  One suggestion for those wishing to make a two-crust pie: roll the top crust between two sheets of wax paper, peel off the top layer of wax paper, then carefully invert onto the pie and peel off the other sheet of wax paper so the crust doesn't break apart during handling.  Pieces that do break off will re-attach with your fingers.  Thanks for offering this superior product!",1
"I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item.",1
I REALLY like this tea so much that I bought another lb in less than a week so I can share it and everyone else loves it too. This tea gets an A+ from me.,1
"These great quality peppermint baking chips look so tempting and festive, I got a few bags to try adding to my holiday cakes.<br /><br />They are easy to work with and just gorgeous when melted just a bit, then swirled into white frosting (that's how I used them) The possibilities with these tasty and colorful chips are endless.<br /><br />The same great quality you find in Andes Cr&egrave;me de Menthe, but in baking form and all made right here in The USA.",1
"Don't buy this if you like Starbuck's coffee.  I love this because it is mild.  In the past, I bought Green Mountain coffee, but I always added water to dilute its taste.  This is a perfect mild taste.  K-cups are expensive, but these taste good, so it's worth the cost.",1
I saw them advertised in the Weight Watcher magazine and gave them a try. I love them. Tasty and crunchy. I've ordered more.,1
"My 7 month old devoured pretty much the whole pouch o the blueberry, pear, purple carrot flavor. He usually only eats half a bag, but just LOVED this one. I love the plum baby foods in general, they seem the perfect consistency for this age. Not too runny like some jar foods and not too thick like other pouch brands! Need to buy a few more of this one!",1
"Unlike most cheap store brands, the first ingredient in this stuff is not corn, its actually chicken - I've always been told cat food with corn as their first main ingredient isn't healthy in the long run. Kitty tend to eat other food too quickly and pukes it up frequently, but this stuff takes much longer for him to chew, and makes him eat slower. Litter box also doesn't smell nearly as horrible as with a lot of other foods I've tried.",1
"So now that I've caved into a growing adoration of matcha, I gave myself permission to cave to the siren's call of Red Leaf Teas. My wife already adores them for their Earls, and Tea Equals Bliss on Steepster has nothing but good things to say about their matchas, so it was an easy next step to take. And the Madagascar Vanilla Matcha was an absolute must for me.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the matcha. I'm in love, y'all. My wife asked how it was, and I could only put the mug down long enough to say ""Oh my gawd...."" Geez, I'm starting to sound like a Paula Dean special. There was no butter added to this tea, y'all, I promise. You all know how much I love vanilla, it's my chocolate, to be perfectly honest. Especially French Vanilla....mmm. Anyway, this has a creaminess that reminds me of a good French Vanilla, but without being overwhelmingly sweet like some French Vanilla teas can be. The greenness of the matcha isn't lost in the flavoring, it's a very nice balance. It doesn't taste artificial, it just tastes delicious and creamy and smooth and everything I ever wanted in a vanilla matcha. This is definitely one I plan to stock up on, once I've tried all of the ones I want to try! Next on my to buy list is cinnamon, and I'm already dreaming about mixing the cinnamon with the vanilla and drifting off into a delicious, delicious sunset! While full of excess energy, of course! Oooh, and mint for homemade, dairy-free Shamrock shakes! Mmmm....I see a lot of possibilities with this little beauty. Anywhere you need touch of creaminess, this matcha is there! Oh man, remember the blueberry pie I made with Vanilla Oolong? It would be out of this world with this matcha. And make it healthy! Well...healthy-ish.<br /><br />This matcha inspires me to bake and blend my own flavors and just go crazy with matcha. I used to only drink matcha occasionally, but I think this particular tea might lead me down the road of ""My Morning Matcha"". There are too many possiblities! Blueberries and Cream matcha, Shamrock Shakes, Dreamscicle matcha...do you see where I'm going with this? And the baking ideas are just as endless. Matcha butter cookies....oh hey, y'all! Lookie there, there is butter in this review. Dang.  I guess I am Paula Dean. I promise I will never deep fry matcha.",1
This item was sent as a gift. It arrived promptly and the recipient was pleased with both the presentation and quality of the product. I would order from this company again in the future.,1
"This soup is in a class by itself.  The ingredients are all the finest and the broth is thick and rich, but not too thick for a chicken noodle soup.  The flavor is out of this world compared to other canned soups.  If it seems a little pricy that's only because it is.  But it's well worth it!  NOTE:  If you like a thicker, even richer broth try the Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Wild Rice.  The chicken is often more dark meat however, so if you're not a dark meat chicken fan stick with this chicken noodle.<br /><br />I was a bit worried about the cans being damaged in shipping when ordering from Amazon, but they are well packaged and after two deliveries so far, they are in pristine condition when they arrive.",1
"This flavoring smells amazing; I bought it to make homemade Bubblegum Ice Cream just like I used to get from Dipper Dan's Ice Cream Parlor when I was a child.  Ordered this but didn't get to make any icecream during the holidays.  Hope to make some soon.  It smells just like bubblegum & I am sure it tastes like bubblegum in recipes.  Thank you so much.  Sincerely, RL",1
I have purchased this about a month ago and just purchased several more shipments. I find this a good alternative to flour type crackers as almost 100% of the carbohydrate is dietary fiber. It also has a neutral flavor which allows you add any condiments to it.,1
"This spice blend makes for a convenient and delicious chicken tikka masala meal. I prepare this as per the package, but use Morningstar Farms vegan chicken strips (4 bags), extra tomatoes, plenty of fresh ground black pepper, and serve it over basmati rice. For two people, it lasts for 3 days.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed. Brilliant and yummy mix of unique Indian spices.",1
This is the best decaf coffee I've tried.  It tastes like regular coffee.  It also has a rich taste that's not bitter.  It's now my favorite.,1
"Simply the best out there. Have been buying this brand for years.  Well worth the extra cost. Flavor and texture, form retention after cooking and second to none. So happy that I am able to purchase thru Amazon.",1
"This is really good stuff, they are a bit soft but I got a number of pieces that gave my jaw an exercise ;p The flavor cannot be beat! (sweet and hot). I also bought the bbq flavored one but I'll finish this one first :)",1
I first had this in  The Caymen Islands. I am pleased to say same quality & freshness as if you bought it there. This is strictly on the 33oz purchased through Amazon. The best rum cake you will find anywhere!,1
"If you like Almonds and Coconut bar you will love these, they are a great snack, and not too sweet,<br />just perfect!!!<br />I will definitely order from Kind again.",1
I bought several of these as a birthday party goody bag filler. This is basically ice cream flavored pop rocks but all of the kids loved them and is a very reasonable price.,1
"I'm from Greece and there's no such thing as ""instant greek coffee"". There seems to be a confusion among reviewers between ""frappe"" and ""greek aka turkish coffee"", we are talking about two completely different kinds of coffee. To make frappe,which is cold coffee, you can use ANY KIND of instant coffee, add cold water, milk (if you want), and ice cubes,shake and serve in a tall glass. To make traditional greek aka turkish coffee (the one served in a small cup like espresso) you need a DIFFERENT TYPE OF COFFEE (eg Loumidis papagalos greek coffee). This kind of coffee is made by adding coffee, sugar (if you want) and water in a tiny boiling pan (called ibrik) and slowly bring it to a boil until the coffee rises. Nescafe classico is a very nice coffee, but it's totally different than the traditional greek/turkish coffee.It can only be used for cold frappe or hot instant, NOT traditional greek coffee.",1
"I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking, I'm guessing major name brands with HFCS as the main ingredient.<br />We bought this at a local organic store, and loved it. We also love the New Century Cola by Blue Sky. It tastes like real root beer. It does not have a heavy licorice taste, nor does it taste like cough syrup. Maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted. But I also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers, which tastes nothing like REAL root bear, cream soda or ginger ale, then they will not like this.<br />If you aren't sure about don't buy the 24 pack. Find it locally, try it, then buy it in bulk.",1
It has gotten very hard to find Wrigleys Spearmint gum.  It nice to find it through Amazon.com.,1
"But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country.",1
I just can't beleive they charge $46 for 3 packs. I buy the same exact product at my local vitamin store and guess what? it is $6 per can!!!!,1
It came right when it was supposed to. Well packaged. Nearly half the price I normally pay at retail stores.,1
"This is good coffee! As soon as the Marley Coffee arrived I brewed up a mug of the elixir, added only real cream, and sat back to see how it went. And it went well! I like my coffee strong, and although this is a medium bodied brew, it can be brewed to be stouter if you have the right coffee maker. The taste is smooth, not bitter, with a bit of fruitiness on the palate - particularly, nice hints of dark cherry. For a smooth and delightful change of pace, I recommend that you give Marley Coffee a try!",1
"Since cats are obligate carnivores, high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy. When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain, useless fillers and by-products from their formulas.My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more. Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new. This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago.",1
This is by far the best alternative to french fries.. they are low calorie & so light to eat. I will definitely keep ordering them & reordering them. I love the fact that they give an assortment of flavors in each box. My family & friends are constantly asking for another flavor to try.... Good job making these Smart Fries...,1
"These chips have a lot of great flavor. Along with just eating them out of the bag, I love using them for Nachos.",1
Simply THE BEST.  NOT hard - GREAT FLAVOR ( the ORIGINAL ) - like eating POPCORN - ya can't STOP !!!!  HELP  !!!,1
"This is one of my fav chilled drinks, and this is the best known brand.<br />Item was delivered the next day!<br />Thank you for keeping my fix.",1
"im lovin the grits. iv never eaten them before and a friend came back from states and i asked him to bring me a box and ive been hooked on them ever since. grits were delivered on time, so easy to cook. awesome service from this seller.",1
"I have tried many flavors of ""Special K"" Bars  and like them all. However, the raspberry cheesecake is my favorite followed by Chocolatey Chip Cookie.<br /><br />Does it have the flavor of a chocolate chip cookie?  YES!<br /><br />Does it look and feel like a chocolate chip cookie?  Of course NOT , its a ""Special K"" Bar!<br /><br />To me ALL ""Special K"" Bars resemble a rice crispy treat.<br />If you like other flavors of this bars and chocolate chip cookies, I think you will like this one!<br /><br />About summer shipping and chocolate... I live in Central Texas. To my surprise, even with it being 106 degrees outside they were only melted a tad. I was eating one before the UPS guy was even out of my drive! Some of the chips were stuck to the top of the wrapper , I licked that wrapper clean(like a kid would do!LOL). The next day I could not even tell they had melted at all. The wrappers were clean.  I am a prime member and got them in 2 days so I am sure that made the difference ;}",1
"Love this coffee, it has just the right amount of flavor, is not to strong or to light. I have several cups through the day and enjoy everyone of them.",1
"Tully's House Blend is the perfect K-Cup for me.  Sure, I occasionally enjoy the special flavors.....Mocha, Italian roast, French vanilla, but my favorite 'go-to'coffee is House Blend. Wakes me up in the morning with it's coffee house full hearty taste.",1
I usually get very irritated under my arms. And so far after 3 of these I'm ok.,1
"Coffee from Hawaii is the best in the world, specificly the Kona side of the island and this is no exception.",1
"Out of the gold foil package, this matcha smells amazingly fruity. Super fruit amazing! The smell reminds me of really tarty berry yogurt. Brazilian Acai matcha appears slightly darker in powder form.<br /><br />I prepared this as a traditional hot cup. This matcha didn't froth up very well nor maintain froth, but I didn't really care. Interestingly, this matcha prepared has a different colour than normal, a dark forest green, probably from the acai berry powder. By the way, I used 1/4tsp plus 175f water.<br /><br />The taste of  Brazilian Acai matcha is quite fruity. A mix between a tropical flavor and blackberries or blueberries. There is also a natural sweetness to this matcha - adding any additional sweetener would be overkill I think. With the fruityness and natural sweetness, this hot cup is very refreshing! There is no tart or bitterness to this matcha! I honestly was expected this to taste tart or puckery.<br /><br />In the end, this was surprisingly good! Is this matcha totally cheating with getting a double whammy of healthy energizing matcha and acai? Don't pass up this matcha - I'm thinking this is up there on being one of my fav flavors from Red Leaf Teas!",1
I got my cat at a shelter and they feed this to the cats there. My cat Wanda loves it. Never any waste and it makes for a cleaner litter box. Cuts stool odor down 90%. No dyes that can stain either. Keeps Wanda happy and very healthy.,1
Newman's Own Pretzels are by far the best I have ever had.  We can get their pretzel sticks at a local store but I always preferred rods and these are much better than Snyder's.  The fact that the ingredients list is short and sweet is just gravy.,1
I got this for my neighbor for a Christmas gift. It was the cutest thing I had seen. It seems to be well made and the treats went in easily. She really loved it and couldn't wait to take it to work to show all of her friends what her dog got for Christmas since we had never seen anything else like this. It is a unique gift!,1
It's pretty much the only thing we drink at home.  Tastes great and everyone likes it.  It doesn't need to be made as strong as the instructions and actually taste better with a lighter dose then recommended.,1
"I wasn't sure if I'd like something flavored with honey because I didn't want it to be overpowering, but I thought this was really good.  This tasted really fruity, with a hint of honey and tea.  If you're looking for a strong tea flavor you might not like this, but if you're looking for more fruity it would be a good choice.",1
"I am a professional dog trainer and I buy this product constantly.  It's a good price for a training treat. One 4 lb roll will last me just over a month when actively training large breed dogs. ( I would say would last one month, as training treats, for 2-3 large breed dogs, depending on their food drive).  I find this to be relatively gentle on their stomachs as well.",1
"These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them.",1
"These are perfect for traveling. On the airplane when they offer you peanuts, pretzels or cookies you can take out an alternate, healthy snack. The only thing is, now I'm addicted to them, they're so good.",1
"If you want your decaf to taste like real coffee -- choose this one!  It is amazing!  I am not drinking caffeinated because I am nursing, so this is a very close second.  I highly recommend it!  I don't find it to be too acidic, but perhaps because I add half and half. Super delicious!",1
"I was previously using the scented Super Scoop and only purchased this because it came in a large box through Prime.  I was concerned it would be stinkier, and was shocked to find out it actually absorbs odor BETTER than the other version.  With the scented kind, I daily used Arm & Hammer deodorizer, which temporarily worked.  However, it caused powdery issues and lessened the clumping power.<br />  With the UNSCENTED kind, I hardly ever use the deodorizer and am MUCH more pleased with the results.  Clumps great, no icky perfumy (or stinky) odors, and much less powder in the air (which REALLY grosses me out).  Best kitty litter I've ever tried, and I've been around cats my whole life.  Highly reccomend.",1
"Tazo Awake has always been my fave black tea especially these K cups.<br />They are convenient, easy to use, and most importantly Never bitter!!!",1
"This is my go-to tea right now.  It's fragrant, delicate, sweet and delicious.  If you love a hearty, robust tea, this isn't it!  Previous posters are right:  it's a delicate brew that should be steeped only for up to a minute (two if you're brave) in sub-boiling water.  Any longer brings out a strong bitter taste thanks to the very young tea.",1
"My dog would consistently get itchy at various times of the year, especially in spring and fall.  We attributed her symptoms to seasonal changes in weather.  However, after I started giving her Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon dry dog food, her allergies basically disappeared.  This is a slightly more expensive dog food, but my dog will get this for the rest of her life.  It saved me a lot of money on vet bills and allergy prescriptions.<br />Her dry fur grew long and silky.  Her energy level increased with this food.<br />The ingredient list is impressive as well.  It has real protein.<br />My dog would ordinarily turn away from dry dog food, but this particular bag has a lot of small flavor bits in it in between larger dry chunks.  It seems like the flavor bits are very appealing to my dog.<br />Please make sure to give your dog water with this dog food.",1
Got my first order of these last week and have ordered four more for friends who keep raving about them! I usually buy these sort of chips at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price and convenience of ordering from Amazon can't be beat. These chips have a great flavor to them and arrived in perfect condition. I love blue corn chips and these are among the best I have ever had. You won't be disappointed!,1
"One of the easiest ways to finish that sauce in a truly professional manner. Where I used to make my own demi - lots of time and effort, now I simply use More than Gourmet products for a comparable result. They're also great for soups- check out the other varieties in the smaller sample sizes to see for yourself how good these products really are. Now, the caveat, you MUST start with good ingredients to create a good finished product, this is not a miracle worker for poor preparation or second rate ingredients, but used as intended it's an excellent time saver.",1
If you have ever spent the summer in Japan and had their green tea shaved ice this is what you had. They serve up shaved green tea ice in a big bowl and it is the cats meow. You can find it cheaper in some of the Asian stores. Buy it durning the winter as it us usually on sale and then enjoy it on a hot summer evening. Mix it up and freeze it until it is almost hard and throw it in the blender to make a slush. Pure enjoyment,1
MIO is the best thing I have found as a diabetic. Contains no Sugar that makes your Sugar raise. My Doctor stated I could drink it with no harm. THANK YOU MIO.....,1
"As many have said, it is very difficult to find a chip that isn't loaded with salt and so much grease you need an entire roll of paper towels to clean up with after just a few bites. You can actually taste the potato these chips were cut from and because of the intense potato taste, you don't miss the salt.",1
I was very surprised how great tasting this oatmeal was! Top it with some fruit and you will love it!!,1
"I have been using Shirataki noodles for about a month now, and I love them.  I found out you must rinse them very well first to get rid of the weird smell.  There are so many ways to use them.  Sometimes I just put a little chicken broth in a pot with the noodles and some seasonings and boil for a couple of minutes and I have wonderful chicken noodle soup without all the carbs and cals of regular chicken noodle soup. Thanks for the great product.",1
"This stuff is delicious and Amazon has the best price on it that I've seen so far (around $2.10 a bottle)<br /><br />I'm a chocolate addict and this stuff is my waistlines saving grace, it's only 120 calories a bottle and I drink half of it at a time. It's also got all the health benefits of regular coconut water (potassium,iron and electrolytes)<br /><br />It's still a little expensive but it's a real treat and I will definitely buy this product again.",1
"Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal.",1
Our family loves these gummy frogs! They are so fresh and soft when you open the bag. They don't even have time to go stale...we finish them off long before then. And the price is fabulous! We have automatic delivery every 2 months (though my kids wish it was more often). Highly recommended!,1
"Haribo saved my life. my marriage. and scored me an executive job!!!  no, but seriously...this stuff taste ""for real"" good!!!!",1
"I love these.  Not because I have eaten them but because my kids will eat them.  I get tired of the daily battle over veggies.  My preschoolers do fine with eating fruits and vegetables most of the time but it is nice to have something on hand for one of those times that you need to get dinner together fast or you are on the go and you want them to have both a fruit and veggie.  These fit perfectly into that scenario.  My boys will finish the entire pouch every time it is given to them.  Often they will want to have it first.  I like the fact that is appears to be a fruit smoothie but there is a vegetable in there.  Personally I love beets, but my kids have not acquired my love for beets so they eat the Beetbox berry without knowing what a beet is.  I also buy them on subscribe and save and sometimes find myself getting an extra shipment.  That tells you how much we like these.  We also like the Carroty Chop and Fruit Berry.  We have tried a few other versions of other brands - one with a Fairy Tale rabbit on it - they hated that one - but these by far are the most popular.",1
"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company.",1
"I just tried the peach almond this morning and love it.  I can't wait to try all the other flavors that I also purchased.  The convenience is great and you don't have to find a cup or bowl for microwaving.  Due to the cost, another reviewer mentioned to make your own.  I do not agree with this at all.  By the time you purchase the oatmeal, peaches, nuts, etc. that are in each of these, you would be spending a lot more than what these cost.  I will continue to purchase these for breakfast at work!",1
This is the only coffee Mom liked from the sample packs that came with the Keurig Coffee Brewer I gave her for Christmas two years ago.  It is impossible to find in retail stores so I have ordered on line from another source for the past two years.  Thank you Amazon.com for adding this to your product line and for the always great delivery service.  Mom is happy.,1
"I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)<br /><br />Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!",1
"Being English, and residing in the US, this is the only mincemeat that I use to make mince pies at Christmas.  Helps me to remember my childhood days of Christmas in England, and eating warm mince pies by a roaring fire. Great product and can highly recommend.",1
"These chips taste even better than non-gluten free bagel chips.  I couldn't believe I went through a box in no time at all (Scary!).  Unfortunately, Amazon's price of this writing, six bucks a box, is beyond crazy!  The boxes aren't very big to begin with!  I paid about four bucks at my local grocery store, and I've seen them on sale for less than three, so shop around!",1
All you diabetics this will do the trick - Excellent hard candy - I was pleasantly suprised by the flavor - reasonable cost - just don't eat too many at one time,1
"Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for ""pee"" rewards and larger ones of another brand for ""poo"" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!",1
"If you have tried Melinda's Habanero sauces before, or Marie Sharps for<br />comparison, and you like the flavor and consistency, but need more heat,<br />then this is just for you!<br /><br />I agree with Mrs. H, this sauce will not blow the top of your head off.<br />Melinda's advertising is somewhat misleading, as this sauce is listed at<br />577,000 Scovilles, its not. The lower scale of Melinda's Habanero selections<br />are i.e. XXX, XXXX Reserve, etc. are separated by degrees of heat. No doubt<br />this is the hottest of the Habanero family, but I'd hazard to guess this is<br />no more than 50,000 Scovilles, although I'm not doubting the Savinas were<br />tested and certified at 577k.<br /><br />When I mention the recipe, I mean this...""Ingredients: Red Savina peppers,<br />hand-selected choice red habanero peppers, fresh carrots, onions, lime juice,<br />vinegar, garlic, and salt"" The vinegar is not noticeable, but in classic<br />Melinda's fashion you get a pulpy carrot/citrus based blast of pure heat that<br />will satisfy most chiliheads.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying this stuff is not hot, it sneaks up on you. And just as<br />you're noticing the mellow flavor of carrots with a lime-juice underscore,<br />you may suddenly realize that the back of your mouth is on fire. But it wont<br />leave any scar tissue or ruin your evening. So as you move up the heat scale,<br />don't pass this sauce by, its terrific on anything. And do yourself a favor,<br />and remove that little stopper/dropper so you can get a liberal dose.<br /><br />5 Scovies!",1
"I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag.",1
"I am used to see either the pink (saccharin) or the blue (aspartame) envelope. One warns about cancer while the other one warns about brain damage. Splenda does not have any of those. Now, the pink and the blue are gone from our work office. First approved for use in Canada in 1991 and later on in the US in 1998.<br /><br />Splenda is multiple times sweeter than the previous sugar substitutes. Unlike saccharin, Splenda does not have a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that Splenda is stable under heat and can be used for baking.",1
"These are better than other gluten free granola bars because they have more flavor. Chewy, but not too sweet. The dark chocolate is a nice addition, as are the raisins. More complicated and dense than other bars and you don't get tired of eating them.",1
"These are definitely the best granola bars I've tasted.  Instead of being a dry texture like most other bars, they are more like Rice Crispy treats.  Great to take anywhere for a snack, quick pick-me-up, or lunch treat.  And nutritious!",1
"If you can't eat regular mac & cheese due to gluten-free diet, this is the next best thing.",1
"I bought this product for my dad and I was very happy with it (:<br />although the shipping PRICE was disappointing.<br />over all, a good product (:",1
"These treats are exceptional.  All 4 of our shelties love them - even the 17+ year old. They have just the right crunch, taking a few seconds to consume, and smell wonderful to us humans too.",1
"Received order as advertised, everything was in excellent condition.<br />My cat Mandy is 19 years old and in excellent health, many thanks to Wellness no grain cat foods.",1
Is a good product and can be used for many different dishes. Makes a good quick sauce for busy week nights.,1
I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.  Thank you!!,1
"I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)",1
"Love all the flavors! Only thing I didn't like is these bottle are plastic, which is great, but the ones you buy in the store are not. All my pourers do not fit these new plastic bottles! Other than that, this is a great deal on a great variety of sugar free syurps!!",1
"Although described as a gopher trap, I have killed 2 moles in my yard with the black box.  It doesn't involve any chemicals or pesticides, is sturdy and can be re-used year to year, a great product.<br /><br />It takes a little learning and patience.  I tried 2 end-to-end but ultimately both my kills involved a single box at the end of a tunnel. Watch where they mound frequently and set it in that spot.  Take the time to dig out a hole with a flat compacted bottom, big enough for the black box.  Cover the holes at the top of the box with patties of damp soil so light will not enter.  Good luck!",1
All the cures work and taste great. I like hickory smoked/flavored items so this was great for me. Great seasoning.,1
"It's not easy to get Beau Monde, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. This seasoning is a really nice addition to soups and stews, also great sprinkled on steak or chicken.  I would definitely buy it again.",1
"I bought this organic whole grain pasta from a local grocery store Mothers & really liked it's flavor & texture.  I almost gave up on whole grain pasta b.c. the few I've tried simply tasted horrible & made me hate my dinner; and I love pasta!  This one didn't give me a bloated stomach & sleepiness as compared to conventional carb-ladden overly-processed pasta.<br /><br />Normal grocery stores don't seem to carry this.  Wholefoods has some varieties but I didn't find this particular one in my local Wholefoods either.  Overall I am very happy that Amazon offers this at a great price with the subscription service, which is totally flexible allowing changes of frequency or even cancellation.  Subscription service shipped it free, the box of 12 arrived lightening fast!  I'm seeing my waistline going down with this and other home-made wholesome food with moderate exercise.  I highly recommand this product.",1
"This salsa uses fresh veggies in its preparation and has a natural, flavorful taste.  I bought some for the holidays when family was around and we all enjoyed it with tortilla chips.  This salsa has:<br /><br />* no preservatives<br />* is fat free<br />* low salt<br />* gluten free<br />* no genetically modified ingredients<br />* no allergens<br /><br />Ingredients include ripe tomatoes, fresh onions, fresh jalapenos, fresh tomatillos, peppers, apple cider vinegar, fresh cilantro, parsley, garlic, and sea salt.  It tastes home-made.  It only has 10 calories for 2 tablespoons. Very delicious salsa!",1
"couldn't find this item in any of the local stores, order, recieved and enjoyed. Will order agian if not found in local stores",1
"I love that green mountain has made blueberry K cups;  I have always loved brewing the coffee in my pot and I am very satisfied that I can make it in a single serving use. the smell is great. I do wish the taste was a bit stronger, but it's perfect with a teaspoon of sugar. The price was excellent too! I am very glad it has dropped and made it more affordable. It's cheaper here than in the store. Will definatly order again",1
"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly.",1
"Absolutely the best!  Aromatic and delicious, rich and luscious.  Highly recommended.  You cannot go wrong buying Choice Rooibos.  A little more expensive, but well worth it.",1
"This is my absolute favorite coffee of all! I have other K-Cups in the carousel and on the kitchen shelf, but they are being totally ignored until I run out of this flavor.  I have recommended it to others, and they all agree that it is delicious.",1
"Naked 100% coconut water delivered exactly what was promised: liquid from inside coconuts and absolutely nothing else. I've drunk the water from fresh coconuts in many countries, and when you can't have it fresh, Naked is as close as you're going to get. It's true that the pasteurization doesn't help the flavor, but it really doesn't hurt it much either. This is the wrong product if you're looking for sweetened, or otherwise messed around with, coconut water, but if you've had the water from fresh coconuts, Naked will not disappoint.",1
"I had never heard of Weaver's, but since this was on special as an Amazon Warehouse deal, I though I'd give it a shot. Very glad I did - this is fantastic coffee! Rich, smooth, no bitterness. Semi-fine ground that works well in a Senseo.<br /><br />I will absolutely be buying this again. Highly recommend if you're a decaf fan.",1
"I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel.",1
I've got 2 dogs and they love this food.  I also like when I order this dog food they ship it free to my house.,1
This cappucino is so good that all the employees at my office are drinking this now and want me to order more! And I was going to try to keep it all to myself!,1
I love this coffee.  It is one of my favorites.  I keep trying other flavors but I go back to this one.  I've also had several different Hazelnut kcups fromt he different makes and I prefer the Green Mountain.  I don't like really strong coffee so this has the right amount of coffee flavor with the hint of hazelnut!,1
I BOUGHT THESE TREATS IN THE 8 OZ SIZE BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD SELLS THAT SIZE.  THEY ARE MADE WITH REAL LAMB.  MY DOG LOVES THESE TREATS MORE THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THEIR LAMB FLAVOR.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK FOR MORE.,1
"For long time I was looking by a sugar free beverage with good flavor. I really hate aspartame taste very bad, but sucralose is a great sustitute of the sugar and green tea taste amazing.",1
"I was rummaging through our kitchen's lazy-susan-corner-cabinet, looking for something quick, easy & ""of substance"" to eat and noticed 1 lone pack, so I decided to try it.  My mother-in-law must've bought it, 'cause I've never seen the brand before.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Brisling Sardines, extra virgin olive oil, garlic powder, black olives & red bell pepper.  I've had some history of eating sardines so I knew what to expect...or so I thought.<br /><br />Opened the can and immediately, I was pleasantly surpised = no outstanding fishy smell.<br /><br />I started eating and man, oh man, I had never had sardines like these before!  They are so delicate & buttery with the perfect amount of saltiness.  Yum, yum and yum.  So much so, I wanted to look this up in Amazon and write a review.  I'll be buying more right this very second!",1
"The turkey was delivered on time, or sooner, for the holidays and got rave reviews. Would buy again from this seller.",1
"This is the BEST apple cider vinegar and one of my best tools to keeping healthy.  I drink this twice a day and lose weight as a result.  This stuff is wonderful and if it is the tastes that bothers you, try mixing it in grape juice and making your own salad dressing with it.",1
"This is absolutely wonderful chile! It has a great flavor unlike most chile powder that is sold in grocery stores that is grown in Mexico.  There is more to chile than heat and while this has a nice bite to it there is also a great flavor which carries thru in whatever you use this for. I'm tossing the store bought brand I have in my pantry and using only this brand from here on out. I gave a bag of this to my sister who lived in New Mexico for a few years and she raved on the flavor as well.  This brand is definitely a 10 out of 10, can't wait to try some of their other products.",1
"Hob Nobs are crunchy sweet cookies, perfect for an after-dinner treat and also perfect for dunking with tea (or coffee) at any time of the day.",1
"I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!",1
We are now on regular shipment of these dried blueberries.  Wonderful product and great value for the cost.  They are great in scones!,1
"If I am in a hurry I just throw a few spoon fulls into some hemp milk or almond milk and call it good.  But what I prefer to do is mix it into my raw veggie juices that I make.  Normally the juice is very, well, juicy.  However, if you add in this protein it thickens the juice so that the texture is more enjoyable.",1
I must say I got more than I expected in a cup of this cappuccino.  It is rich and creamy and the flavor is great!,1
"I've purchased this coffee twice through Amazon.  Both times, I received a great price.  Buying the 96-count was the cheapest route.  My husband loves this coffee!  We highly recommend it!",1
"Just had the kids try this flavor they loved it as much as the apple.  Will buy again.<br /><br />Below is my original review for the plain apple GoGo Squeez to finish this review.<br />When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these. Not until my father had handed it to my hungry daughters one day. It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car. You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped. Being diabetic he needed something fast. He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour. When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control. Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough. So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital. For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.",1
when will it be available again because every day that i check for the last 2 months it has not been available.,1
I love these sugar-free jelly beans. They are very sweet. My favorite is the cinnamon and buttered popcorn together. I also really love the licorice. But I think they are all great and better then most fruit flavored sugar-free candies. I eat between 10 and 20 at a time each day and they don't bother my stomach.,1
I love this tea.  It has great flavor.  It really beats all the tea bags I've been using.  Add some fruit while brewing for extra flavor.,1
"This is my favorite hot sauce.  It has a rich, complex flavor, loaded with garlic and sweet hot chili peppers.  I use it on sandwiches, as a marinade for meats and for roasting root vegetables.  Try tossing cubed turnips and rutabaga in Sriracha and roast in the oven at 400F until tender.<br /><br />Warning!  This sauce is very addictive!!",1
Wellness wet cat food is terrific.<br />My three cats gobble it up.<br />Healthy too.<br />My diabetic cat went didn't need insulin anymore after I switched from dry food to this wet food.<br />And she went from highly overweight to just fine.,1
"McCann's steel cut oatmeal is the real deal.  Unlike most products which have a plastic or paper container, McCann's still comes in an easy to open tin which a person can use for many things after the oats are long gone.  The oatmeal is not for a person in a hurry as you need almost 30 minutes to prepare.  But the cooked oatmeal is well worth waiting for.  Unlike rolled oatmeal which to me makes a mushy product which I won't eat, steel cut oats actually retain some of their shape after being cooked.  Since I've started eating oatmeal regularly, my total cholesterol has dropped 20 points!  McCann's steel cut oatmeal have a long shelf life, so I'm not afraid of buying a 4-pack or even two 4-packs when they are on special.  I've seen one can go for over $6 in some special food markets.  Enjoy!",1
"I have been looking for this since I tried it at the theaters, now I could enjoy it at home!",1
This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.,1
"Excellent Energy drink, I drink one-a-day before I go for my daily walk, gives me a nice boost!  I like the taste, may take a few too get used to it!  No jitters just a boost!",1
I use two dry spoonfuls in my coffee for a fat free creamy cup of coffe without cooling it down too fast.<br /><br />I get it at BJ's for $13.49.,1
Our two year old loves these gummy bears.  I feel less guilty about giving these to her since they're all natural.,1
"This is the first time I have tasted Stash tea and I wasn't disappointed. It was a great price, well packaged (the individual tea bags as well as the general package) and it tastes great.",1
"This is a superb coffee.  It has a full but balanced flavor without the poor aftertaste of many coffees.  It's a bit on the expensive side, but the quality is excellent.",1
"I cannot get enough of this stuff.  I have this stuff in my kitchen all the time.  To me, it's the best Granola cereal out there.",1
Best bang for the buck for salad dressing.  Neither harsh and acidic like store-bought wine vinegar nor sweet and syrupy like what passes for basalmic.,1
Muir Glen Organic tomato products are the best. This is the only place in my area that I can find them by the case. Thank you and please keep them available.,1
"We enjoy Maxim's Rue Royale tea, but it is difficult to obtain and is more expensive than this Harney and Sons offering.  Paris is very similar in fragrance and taste.  It is perfect ""as is"" and doesn't require sugar or lemon to enhance its flavor.",1
"according to my nutritionist, coconut water is much healthier for you than gatorade. I'd say Zico Mango is the best coconut water flavor choice available!",1
"Highly recommended - this has been a big hit at parties, for both my gluten-tolerant and gluten-intolerant friends!  Based on what disappears by the end of the party, and from personal experience, the cheddar flavored ones are best.",1
I love this Popcorn.  We use it at the bar and everybody loves it. A big hit with the customers. No more microwave popcorn for us.  We love it so much I even buy it to use at home.,1
"I recently had to go gluten free.  I have disliked so many products, because I can't get used to the tastes of some of the flours.  I would NEVER had guessed these were gluten free.  They are delicious!  I really have to use self control so that I don't eat them all in one day. If only I could find a gluten free bread that tastes good.",1
These raspberries and blackberries are so good if you like berry flavor. They taste authentic and there is nothing cheap about them. High quality candy.,1
"Initially I used Orgain for weigh loss replacing 2 meals a day with it and I lost about 25 pounds over the course of 5 months.  Now I'm using Orgain as a post workout drink and I've never felt better.<br /><br />I owe my health to this drink and recommend it to all of my friends and family.  Used to drink slim fast and will never get near it again after how delicious this is, both chocolate and vanilla!",1
"My office offered this item & the Apple (Orchard Spice) one briefly a couple of months ago - I love them both. I was hoping to get some on my own for those mornings I'm too busy to eat at home. I'm hoping Amazon will offer them soon. I love the separate little packets of sugar, fruit & crunchy nuts to add to the oatmeal to taste. Another plus is the size of the cup - big enough to stir the items in once hot water has been added!",1
"This stuff is an incredible value. The soda stream device is a COMPLETE RIP OFF,But if you add up 50 cans of red bull the cost would be anywhere from $150-200 which pays for the cost on the machine and then some with the savings of buying this syrup. The purchase of the machine is worth it but only if you like the energy syrup, otherwise go to walmart and buy a two liter of regular pop for a buck.",1
"I am not in love with strong coffees at all, I drink it for flavor not for heart shaking, and this is my favorite so far. It has very mild delicious taste, after trying so many more I just stuck on this one. Please make it ""unlimited edition"" ))",1
"I am very impressed with the new Peanut Butter Grahamfuls by Honey Maid, which I just tried for the first time this week. They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!",1
This was the only way we could get my son to drink milk. He loves it so much now that we sometimes are not worried if he does not eat well because we know he gets his nutrition from ovaltine.,1
"These are so delicious. They are very light, crunchy and just the right amount of sweet. I bought these for my kids' lunches but I enjoy them every now and then with ice cold milk.",1
"I've been buying this line of products for years.  We have pugs and they don't do well with large hard treats.  These are perfect.  They are soft and very small so it's not an issue giving multiple ""cookies"" as they are low in calories.  And of course the dogs love them.",1
"I like my coffee dark where my wife likes her coffee medium.  This has the boldness and richness of the dark (which I like) without the bitterness or aftertaste that darks normally have (which my wife doesn't like).  We both can enjoy this coffee.  It is a good smooth great every day coffee.<br /><br />I use it in a french press, moka stove top and keurig ... it is great in all of them.  It is a bonus that this is equal exchange and organic too.<br /><br />Price is slightly higher than other premium coffee but you get what you pay for.  The few bucks extra is worth it in my book.  Coffee at home is still a lot cheaper than buying it out all the time and this stuff is great.",1
"My 5 cats would kill me for Temptations if they had to.  They LOVE these treats. Every time I go into the kitchen, I'm doomed to have at least 3 of them follow me and meow me into submission so that I give them this variety and all other varieties of Temptations.  'Nuff said.",1
"Arrived in two plastic bags inside a box. I found the tootsie pops to be great, not perfect, but pretty close. Didn't have the problems some other reviewers had...no old or super sticky wrappers. Some of the pops may have been blems or maybe what's considered factory seconds?? They were broken up but yet in one piece as if they were glued back together with sugar! Sounds crazy but that's the best way I can explain it. Would I order from them again? Absolutely!!",1
"My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.",1
"I haven't been taking this product long enough to know how effective it is, but at least I can say it's yummy!",1
"I purchased XXXsmall boots for my 6 1/2 pound toy fox terrier and they fit perfect. They were a little tough to get on the first couple of times, but once we got the hang of it, it's easy now. I really didn't think my dog would keep them on, but he does. He prances around as if he were a king. These are very well made and have velcro bands to adjust for the size leg. They look very cute on. Highly recommend them.",1
This stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that I am actually allowed to eat!<br />My doctor tells me I'm celiac- this was three years ago now. I just hope I can continue to find this Bisquick!,1
"I found this product today while on a trip, and it's genius. These are pre-measured packs of formula, just like the ""to-go"" water adults use in their water. All you do is add to 4 (or 8) oz of water and feed.  No need to bring along a bigger container, or pre-mix bottles and hope they don't go bad before I feed the baby.  My only criticism is that the package could be easier to open, since it was hard to open it while holding a baby, but the convenience factor far outweighed that.  I will definitely purchase this product again.",1
These worked great for us.  We are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before discarding them.  We love being able to use our favorite coffee.,1
"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also.",1
I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast,1
I had these wonderful chips in Ireland a few years ago on vacation and was sad that I could not find them in America.  Now that I have I will be in so much trouble ordering them all the time.  I love these chips!!!,1
"To date, this is the only gluten free cookie I've tried and absolutely loved.  They have a livelier flavor than vanilla wafers and are sweeter (but not too sweet) than what you expect from regular animal crackers.  I subscribed to these and am glad they come in the bulk quantity they do, since even my gluten-loving coworkers devour them as soon as they see they're out for taking.",1
"I originally purchased these for a friend, who recently converted to a vegan diet. She raved about it so much that I decided to try it out myself. These cookies are absolutely delicious. They have a very intense chocolate taste that is not overly sweet as some chocolate cookies can be. Highly recommended.",1
Very happy with this product.  The vinegar has a smooth sweet taste that accents almost anything!!  I've used it in a fresh tomatoe salad and also to marinate meat and it was fabulous!!,1
I don't seem to be able to purchase this product locally anymore.  It's a very unique chilli and everyone I have served it to loves it.,1
This was perfect for me as i can use 1 jar at a time for my cooking when i make chicken fricassee or beef stew as well as hispanic meals like rice with chicken.the slender jar takes very little space in my refrigerator. Also it assures the olives are always fresh. Olives also can be used in conjunction with various spreads on crackers as an appetizer.,1
My wife and I brew and drink a cup of Senseo Medium Roast coffee everyday--have done so for years.  We almost always buy it from Amazon.com and find the price to be best there.,1
"I LOVE this sauce! It is sweet and molasses-y, with a tiny kick of heat.  I use it to make Hawaiian chicken or pork all the time.  I've never had authentic Jamaican jerk, so I can't vouch for accuracy there, but my whole family loves this one :D",1
"I'm a big fan of granola, but this is by FAR my favorite. Full of nuts, fruit, and lightly sweetened. Mmmm, I love it! Great as a meal with milk or as a snack just by itself. I haven't tried it, but I'll bet it would taste AWESOME with some vanilla yogurt. It really fills you up.",1
"I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.",1
"Our gluten free flour mix recipe: One bag of brown rice flour, 1 cup of corn or potato starch, 1 cup of ground flax seed, 1/2 cup of tapioca starch, 2 tablespoons xanthan gum: shaken together in a zip bag. Substitutes for flour in any recipe.",1
"My kids love these crackers. They are more healthy than your high sugar high salt alternatives usually found in the store. They taste really good (about what you would expect from a Keebler cracker), but the ingredients are all things you recognize and would put into crackers you make at home. They are organic, so if you care about that - this would be a plus as well.<br />The price is fair, especially if you use subscribe and save. My kids have been eating these since they were toddlers and even though they are older now, they still enjoy them. Yes, they do have Elmo crackers, so they may not be welcome in your older child's lunch bag, but would be a great guilty pleasure for them to have as a snack at home.<br />I will also admit that I LOVE them as well!",1
"I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!",1
"This hemp milk is almost the best thing a person can drink.I think that the flax milk is probably the best for nutriants,but hemp milk comes pretty close.",1
"We buy this pumpkin as a supplement for our dogs. It is very hard to find pumpkin offseason, especially in a small town. We buy this buy the case every few months and it always comes quickly with no dented cans. It is a great deal.",1
"I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.",1
I enjoy mixing agave nectar with this coconut oil and using it as a dip for fruit & nuts! What a yummy nutritious treat!,1
This is one good way to treat yourself for cold winter weather. It is absolutely yummy and so rich! Only 80 calories and 25 fat per envelope too. I wouldn't forget to pick up another box next time for sure cause I'm almost running out of it! :^),1
"My family and I have been drinking Pero, for approximately 20 years and we will keep on drinking it. It's one of the best products we use. We not only drink Pero for breakfast but at any time we desire.",1
Good tasting tea. I drink at least 3 times per day. Especially good in the evening since I can't tolerate caffeine before bed time.  Great product.,1
My kids (ages 4 and 8) gobbled these snack-sized packets of caramel popcorn!  They LOVED these packs and I didn't mind giving them the popcorn either because they are portioned out nicely.  They were perfect for lunchboxes and after school snacks.  I can't wait to try them in other flavors!,1
"I first discovered the Teeny Tiny Spice products when I was visiting Vermont, and I am thrilled that Amazon is carrying their products. These are not your ordinary spices! The Penang Curry is not hot, and it is not like the jars of curry powder we are used to seeing. It is more of an herb blend (organic) with very complex flavors. The spices are fresh, and I don't believe there is any salt added to this blend. There are two recipes right on the can, and the website has many recipes using their spice mixtures. I highly recommend using this for the chicken satay recipe. A little spice mixture goes a long way. These mixtures make excellent gifts for the foodies in your life. So long to boring chicken and pork!",1
"This is simply some of the best tasting coffees you can get.<br /><br />When I got the bag it was marked ""dark"" and the beans were practically black with an oily sheen on them.<br /><br />I thought ""crap"" I should have ordered medium.  This stuff is going to taste like charcoal.<br /><br />But there was no burnt taste at all and no bitterness at all and I mean none.<br /><br />This stuff is so smooth it's almost like drinking hot dark chocolate.",1
A friend's research to find a good food for her diabetic cat revealed that the choices specifically in the FF Classic are lower in carbs than most on the market. Her cat's diabetes resolved and she attributed it to the FF Classic.<br />Can't beat the price through this seller and shipping arrangement!,1
"Almost identical to Ghiradeli's great chocolate taste...but raw!organic! The best!!! I also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with Strvia and make ball/snacks from it, yummmm",1
These things are great! We found them while traveling in BC when our daughter was 5 months. She got the hang of them real quick with no choking! Now we take them everywhere with us. They are a great snack and great entertainment.,1
The sugarless mix is very satisfactory and it's fewer calories. Go for it.,1
"Coffee beans are one of those food items that can be very high in pesticide residues, so along with bananas, milk, lettuce and a few other things, we added coffee to our 'must buy organic' list. After being thoroughly spoiled by Lavazza super crema, Lavazza gran riserva, and Filicori Zecchini gran crema forte, we had a hard time finding an organic espresso that wouldn't disappoint. We've been using BackCountry organic basecamp espresso for three weeks now, and are thoroughly delighted. Although the crema (foam) isn't quite as pronounced as you get with the italian espressos I mentioned, the taste is excellent! It's creamier and less bitter than other organic espressos i've tried, and is a solid replacement for the Lavazza super crema (in taste, not crema). If the price stays comparable to Lavazza, we'll stick with BackCountry for our morning routine.",1
"My daughter, who is in preschool, loves these Happy Baby organic pouches-her tops flavor are the apple-cherry, pear, mango, banana kiwi.  They are perfect chilled and very nutrient dense.  Easy to throw in bag as the package is soft and BPA free.",1
"It is very good tuna, the package is hillllarrious! No Tuna in nature is as white as that photo on package perhaps maybe the rare, ever so elusive, albino tuna. If you have purchased Tuna in a pouch before then you know that this in reality, looks like beige colored canned tuna smashed flat. But it forks up into chunks or more like flakes.<br /><br /> It has virtually no water added but is not too dry, has a very mild taste, and is very convenient in the 1 serving pouch. It has 80 calories and is a decent source of Omega-3 EPA and DHA with 190mg of those combined in each serving, not a whole lot, but very good.  I would buy again but only on sale as it's really only worth a buck twenty five each for these 2.5 ounce servings.",1
"I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not.",1
You will never go back to drinking another soda again.<br /><br />But if you want to buy this for $1.50 just go to any hispanic store.<br /><br />They have these everywhere. $4.00 seems a bit much for something you're going to enjoy every day.,1
"All of my cats like this food, including the two that generally only eat wet food if it's tuna. It is a tightly packed food and you can definitely spot the big chunks of sardine among the chicken.<br />And it is a good value as far as quality, natural cat food goes. It is made with human-grade ingredients and no byproducts or fillers. I want to try more varieties of Natural Value to add to my cats' diet.",1
"Crunchy, not greasy, no saturated fat, and YUMMY!  Oh, and VEGANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!  I'm completed addicted and have nearly gone through 2 cases.",1
"My husband and I are Bone Fish Bang Bang Shrimp nuts!  We order it often.  I am a recipe hound and am always looking for copy cat recipes and this is it.  I read up on one of the recipe sites about this sauce being as close as you can get to the real thing.  Of course Bone Fish will not give out its recipe, however this is close.  There is a recipe on line that is pretty close and then we toss this sauce...delicious.  Great product!  The sauce is great on other items as well.  FYI its got a kick.",1
"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!!",1
My dog was crazy about these treats!  She hounded me every day until I gave one to her...but only one.  They're quite large and seem to be of good quality.,1
"I grew up in the south and love a strong glass of sweet iced tea. I also like my hot tea sweet and creamy, and this tea is perfect. I've tried more expensive mail-order brands but now that I've found Stash, it has become my new favorite.",1
"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.",1
"The stash teas are handy, with great flavor at a good price. I usually get wild raspberry. I got mango/passion fruit this time.<br />I just drop it in a mug O' room temp water, and keep topping it off as I drink it. It is naturally sweet enough for me- un adulterated. No caffeine, no sugar, and so pleasant. Handy in the foil packs, and simple packaging. The foil packs make it nice to put a couple in your pocket or pack, or give a few to a friend.",1
"My son who is 4 1/2 and GFCFSF LOVES this drink.  It has calcium, some protein and comes in singe serve packs, as well as larger containers. It is a must at our house, and with Subscribe and Save is very reasonable.  It really is yummy!",1
"My preference is Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  It is never bitter or too strong.  I like coffee, but those strong ones just don't make it with me.  Give me the mild ones any day.",1
"I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.  The low calorie and healthy ingredients are a big plus when you are feeding them to your dog as a reward for training.<br /><br />The treats are moist, but do not leave a greasy residue on your hands if you are holding a bunch as rewards. The treats have a slight smell, but not anywhere near as much as some of the other moist treats on the market.  They are small in size, but provide quick satisfaction to my 50 pound dog and have really helped her learning process.<br /><br />As an amusing anecdote, my 6 pound Siamese/tiger mix loves the treats as well! Whenever she hears the bag, she comes running and will sit and ""assist"" me in training the dog, as long as she gets her fair share as well!",1
"As someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I am always looking for an effective and tasty caffeine boost. Problem is, I don't like the taste of coffee, and soda has high calories-to-caffeine ratio. Energy drinks typically have a chemical taste that doesn't sit well with me. The Zipfizz Grape Energy Drink Mix provides an excellent boost of energy, yet tastes pretty good. I get as much energy from one tube than I would from a cup of coffee or Red Bull. If you've had a five-hour energy shot you'll understand the type of boost you get from a Zipfizz. It has no calories from sugar, and is low carb, plus since you are mixing it with water you stay pretty hydrated. One caveat: do not drink one of these in the evening unless you plan on staying up really late; I drank one at about 6pm and was up past 3am. Thankfully, I didn't feel jittery or irritable, just WIDE awake. Also, other reviews have mentioned that this keeps you regular, and yes it does indeed.",1
"I've fed my little pug this dog food brand all his life. Now as a young adult I feed him 2/3 cups of food daily. He's energetic, happy, and not over weight as pugs tend to get. He also has a very healthy and minimal stool - which is great because he is trained to use a litter box with a ""permanent"" type doggie pee pad (changed daily) in the bottom. Pudge is always ready to eat so, I try to give mostly healthy treats: maybe a few bites of veggies of my dinner plate and maybe a milk bone a few times a week. But he loves his Wellness and its made him a handsome, healthy little dude",1
OMG I cannot even begin to descibe how delicious these bars are! It is like an almond joy without the chocolate! YUM!!!,1
I make a lot of soups and I've switched to eating organic as much as reasonably possible. I saw this and it fits with what I'm doing. I have soup before each meal to allow me to cut back on total calories per meal. What good is high sodium soups and broths though! Spend the extra money and get this.,1
"I've tried a lot of different beef jerky products, including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51NA"">Mr. Z Beef Jerky</a> from Amazon, as well as the store brand from Jewel, and a great many others, including buffalo jerky like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48P4U"">Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky </a>. Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.",1
"Great option for those needing a high-quality wet food for their kitten/cat, very convenient for stocking up and saving many trips to local pet stores for the smaller cans. One note, its almost necessary to have one of the plastic can covers to easily store the can in the fridge between uses. Very high quality food, comes in many flavors, all of which our kitten has liked so far.",1
"This is an excellent wild rice.  Wild rice can be hard to find in the grocery stores, especially in the South.  I happen to love it, and most of all, I love the price here rather than buying a tiny stale box in a grocery store.  It's reasonably fresh, the grains are reasonably whole, and I'm reasonably pleased too!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about some broken grains.  I feel that is probably inevitable after shipping, and since I live a long ways from the wild rice fields, I'm going to have to accept the broken grains as part of the deal.  There aren't many, it's very much whole grain and ""fancy"" grade.  I'd serve this to guests or my family without worries.<br /><br />We don't generally mix wild rice while cooking, preferring to mix other rices in after cooking them separately so that I don't have to worry about different ratios of cooking time, water, etc.  Typically, I use wild rice in a wild rice pilaf or stuffing for poultry.  I definitely recommend this brand.",1
"Bran muffins have been a breakfast mainstay at my house for years now, and Kretschmers is by far the best brand of bran to use for bran muffins.<br /><br />Sure, you could buy bulk bran at a health-food store, but there's too much moisture in bulk bran.  Your muffins will end up chewy and gluey.  There's no substitute for Kretschmers toasted wheat bran to make your muffins light, crumbly, and slightly crunchy.<br /><br />The problem is that many local stores simply don't stock it, so it can be very hard to find.  Our thanks to Amazon for making this product available, and at a reasonable price, too.",1
I've tried many but this is a great tasting coconut water with just a hint of mango.  Refreshing!,1
"If you like black tea, this is the best. A deep rich flavor, outrageously wonderful with milk. Puts other black teas to shame.",1
"These are great--just like I remember them. Chocolate, marshmallow, coconut. Also, they are virtually impossible to find in the stores now. Buy a box--you won't be disappointed!!",1
"This is a wonderful alternative to rice. It is easy to make. I use the microwave instructions. I used to buy it in the local grocery stores. But I haven't been able to find it. By chance I found it on Amazon and because there was no shipping cost, it cost the same as I used to spend in the store. I love this and it is healthy and high in fiber. My kids even love it.",1
"I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.",1
"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables. I stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy. She always finishes it, and its one of our favorites.",1
"This seasoning mix takes taco salad or tacos to a whole new level.<br /><br />I brown meat in a little olive oil and then add this seasoning.  I do not add the tomato sauce as shown on the instructions.  After adding the spice to the meat, you only have to wait a few minutes before the flavor is nice and deep.  If you really enjoy spicy, add two packets instead of one to a pound of the meat. Great!<br /><br />So many flavors in such a little package!",1
"My wife eats them constantly, loves them!<br />I found them a little strong but have quit smoking<br />And now like them more, sugar free will save you<br />In dental bills. When I quit smoking gum and other stuff<br />Did a number on me.",1
"During my high school and college years,McVities product line provided me some real comfort on many a bad day with no Hershey bars on the horizon. Hobnobs have a clean,not-too-sweet flavor and a pleasant crumbliness,rather like an upgraded oatmeal cookie minus the raisins. They are good dunking cookies if you don't mind getting oat crumbs at the bottom of your cup of hot chocolate. A handful of Hobnobs and a glass of milk are a good tide-me-over in that expanse of time between lunch and dinner.",1
"I purchased the Ultra Premium dog food to help with my dogs allergy issues. I have tried all kinds of food to help with my Beagle dogs allergies and none worked as well as this, I have even tried much higher priced food and none did the job. She eats it easily and has no problems going outside to potty. Her allergies have cleared up a lot and I've had no repeated visits to the vet. Shes been on this food for awhile now and really loves to eat. I highly recommend this food for any dogs that have allergy issues or who are just picky eaters. I think any food that your dog likes to eat and has no issues with is a big step to a healthy happy life for your pup.",1
"I've really enjoyed this K-cup. The coffee is strong and flavorful and I love that the Cups are recyclable. After I open the package, I put the remaining K-cups in a container in the refrigerator to help keep them fresh.",1
"I love that this is pure protein. It tastes like malted milk w/o the sugar. I don't need to ingest additive, colors or flavoring. I don't labeling with, 'Yeah, brah' design, a million colors & veins popping out. That most protein powders are sweetened flies in the face of trying to be healthy. You don't need the additives and you certainly don't need to train your body to always crave sweets. The best part is that, without any flavoring added, Jarrow's Whey Protein tastes delicious with plain milk or water.",1
"My mom has bought me all the flavors of these treats. The Wheat, Corn, Soy Free is pretty much the only flavor that I like. And I don't just like them, I LOVE them. I don't know why they are called everlasting because I inhale the entire treat in under 30 minutes these days! (I'm now 80 pounds so maybe that's why). I highly recommend these treats.",1
So delicious and so healthy.  Fresh and crunchy - much better than peanuts.  I love these soy nuts!,1
"I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.  When I reached high school, the stress transformed the frequent headaches into occasional migraines.  I treated them for a while with prescription medicine but eventually decided I'd rather live with the pains and adjust in the necessary ways than continue taking medication.  About a year ago, I read an article about Natural CALM and figured `What the heck.'  I was highly doubtful.  I've never been so glad to be wrong.<br /><br />I buy the raspberry-lemon flavor.  To me, it tastes like a bit of raspberry lemonade Crystal Light mixed with an Alka-Seltzer.  I certainly wouldn't drink it just because I'm thirsty, but I can tolerate a 12 oz. glass of it in the evening.  In the beginning, I didn't feel much of a difference.  However, once I started taking about 1 teaspoon - which you have to work up to - I noticed a difference in my quality of sleep.  I kept slowly raising the amount and now use about 2 teaspoons nightly.  I don't find that the CALM makes me fall asleep earlier/faster, but I have found that I don't constantly wake up like I did before.  The nighttime leg cramps have almost completely gone.  And the headaches - the constant pounding and throbbing and aching in my head has diminished to just the occasional headache.  As an added benefit, I seem to deal with stress (especially work stress) much better than I did before.  I tried something else to help with sleep (see below) and, after I stopped taking that, I didn't start taking the CALM again for a little while to see if I could actually tell a difference in the way I felt, slept, and reacted to events.  I did - and so did some others around me!  From now on, I don't plan to go without it.<br /><br />I love this stuff and I turn as many people onto it as I can.  A friend purchased some CALM (the regular flavor:  it worked but tasted pretty bad and made the nightly dose challenging to keep up with) and decided to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N23AE8"">SERIPHOS - 100 - Capsule</a> when she ran out of CALM.  While I was visiting, she gave me some to try.  We both found that it gave us the oddest nightmares and made us very groggy/tired in the morning.  My mother, at her doctor's recommendation, started taking a small dose of melatonin to help her get to sleep and stay asleep through the entire night (she'd often get up about 3 AM and couldn't get back to sleep).  Several times after she started taking it, I called her and she slurred her words as if she were taking some sort of narcotic and she wouldn't remember that she'd even spoken to me on the phone.  I sent her a bottle of the orange flavor (she said it tastes ok - like a Sunny D Alka-Seltzer) and she actually adds it to her morning and bedtime cups of decaf orange tea instead of using the melatonin.  She's sleeping like a champ now.<br /><br />If you're considering the purchase, do it!  Like everything, it may not work for everyone, but it's worth a try if you're even thinking about it.",1
"Sometimes more is NOT better.  In this instance, however, double the bergamot IS FAR superior to regular Earl Grey tea.  Stash found a good balance and actually improved on what a basically good thing (Earl Grey tea).  If you have not tried this I highly recommend it.  You will never look at tea the same again.",1
I purchased this 12 pack of pumpkin and was delighted.  All cans were perfect...no dents at all.  The pumpkin was flavorful and great to work with.  I would recommend this purchase highly.,1
This is my family's favorite flavor of the Hansen Diet Sodas.  It has a clean and crisp taste and is enjoyable on its own or with meals.  It even calms down an upset tummy.,1
"This product is far ahead of prepared loaves of bread. It is as easy to prepare as a cake mix, providing you are using a bread machine with a Gluten-Free setting. The bread holds together for sandwiches and is not crumbly or dry at all. It is delicious!",1
"I've been feeding my cats wellness since I weaned the stray kitten and got the shelter kitten, and they seem to like all the flavours plenty but I've been alternating this and the straight chicken stuff for the past few weeks and they've basically stopped eating the chicken stuff, I guess saving space for this stuff instead.",1
"my two dogs absolutely LOVE zuke's hip action dog treats!  it's so great to finally find a ""treat"" that's not only beneficial to their health as well as them really liking the way they taste ~ i only have to give them each two a day ~ my dogs have a combined weight of 185 lbs.!  most ""treats"" recommend feeding a lot more making it kind of expensive ~ the price is right and maya & luna are happy!  i will definitely be ordering on a regular basis!",1
"This is an item that I could no longer get in stores and I so enjoyed drinking it. I am thrilled to be able to get this product so convenietly and at a good prise, from a reliable source.",1
"These cookies are good, but are very crumblely.  Even though I like the taste, I will not buy again because they crumble way too much and make a big mess every time you take a bite.",1
"I'm sure a lot of you guys are here because of the Scooby Bodybuilding, and Here is my review. Well if you've made it so far and you are here reading this review then don't expect it to be a real taste changing seasoning that you would expect to be real delicious and will make your food exceptionally tasty.But it does it's job, being all organic and add a little taste to the food with a distinctive flavor. I add a lot of it on my food while cooking and finish my meal without complaining about the taste or flavor. For a small experiment I let my cousins try it and they didn't like it, may be matter the fact they are not trying to lose the water weight/don't care about adding extra water weight. But go ahead and order it as it will help you to improve your habit of consuming a lot of sodium everyday. All you need is your willingness to achieve what this product helps you with being simple and organic, cutting down the sodium in take.",1
MMMMmmmmmm....Some of the best hard candy made!  This is my wifes fave and if she is happy my life is good!,1
"I take these to work along with little minature milks I pick up at the convenient store. They're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine. And they're not too bad for you either. Considering they're all the ""sugary"" cereals your Mom complained about when you were a kid. In fact the one with the highest calorie count (280) is the Rasin Bran, and that's something that would actually be considered ""healthy"". All the rest fall into the 160-220 range.",1
"My husband and I enjoy ""light"" coffee and this is the best light coffee I have had. It doesn't even need to have much sweet added to it. If you are a ""light"" coffee drinker then this is a good choice to try.",1
"I have been a fan of Starbucks Coffee for a long time.  Although that is not a very unique thing in our time, I tend to avoid some flavored coffees because they tend to get old pretty quick.  During the Christmas season, you see cinnamon, gingerbread and other flavors that are to remind us that winter is here.  These wear on me pretty quick and I usually loathe getting through the canister or package of coffee after the first couple of cups.<br /><br />This Vanilla Flavored Coffee is really a nice treat.  My wife enjoys the aroma as it brews.  She does not like the smell of some coffees, but this one is pleasant and it really tastes like it smells.  One thing I like too is that you can get a more bold flavor if you wish by adding just a little more than the recommended serving, giving it a Vanilla Pikes type taste.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more flavors from the Starbucks Natural Fusions collection.  Enjoy this as the months grow colder.",1
"I absolutely love the pineapple flavor. It is indeed very addicting. Not very sweet, satisfies thirst and the flavor is just a winner.<br />I had to sign up for subscribe and save. Only wish it was a little cheaper, but that still won't take out a star from my review.",1
"Cafe Altura Organic Peruvian Dark Coffee Beans;<br />My only question about this coffee is:  Why does anyone buy any other coffee?<br />Well, no I do have another: If it is coffee, what should we call the other so called coffees?",1
This is the best product for any kind of recipe using tomatoes.  America's Test Kitchen routinely rates it as one of the best.,1
"I love this candy and can't seem to find it in stores any longer so I was pleased to find them through Amazon.  The delivery didn't take any time at all either, very prompt service.",1
"I was really just looking for something a better than Twinings loose. I'd thought about the stash double bergamot but the reviews were not that great. I was a little leery of getting this because the company is obviously a coffee company but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tea leafs were of a very good quality, very little tea 'dust' you see in in alot of the bag and some of the loose teas. The aroma is amazing and fills the room when steeping this tea. Very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Be careful though, the picture on amazon doesn't really call out that this is a 2lb bag. Thats ALOT of tea, makes this a good bargain but might wanna find someone to share it with.",1
"After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few ""old maids"". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.<br />I will definitely buy this product again.",1
"Of all the other hot cereals by Bob's Red Mill this one is my favorite.  Every morning I have some of this cereal and sometimes at night too.  It's really good and family enjoy it too.  Packaging, shipping and price are all great, especially knowing I can get this here on Amazon.",1
I first found these at a local deli but they freqently were out of stock so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. These are very satisfying and I have great fun introducing friends and co-workers to them.<br /><br />I also frequently recommend them to people with sore throats or coughs. Honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy.<br /><br />I bought a case so I can hand them out to people having a bad day. :),1
i have tasted the instant oatmeal and i didnt like it . This is so much better tasting with a lot more texture and bite to it. Try it and you will never go back to the rolled oats again.,1
"I am in awe of this peanut butter. It is seriously delicious. And I could seriously sit down with a spoon and consume an entire jar of the stuff. In fact, all products from PB&Co I have enjoyed immensely. They simply know their way to a pb-lover's heart with all these amazing flavors. My advice: go out and buy this peanut butter right now! I take pleasure in using it as a dip for apples and bananas, spread on a whole wheat tortilla with strawberries, or eaten straight. You'll never look at peanut butter the same.",1
"I used to buy the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG598"">Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> and I am SO glad I discovered the NOW almond flour.  The Bob's almond meal works, but I didn't really care for the flavor or the texture--I just thought I needed to learn to like them.<br /><br />This NOW Foods almond flour is so much better!  The Bob's almond meal is kind of gritty...so I just thought that when you grind almonds, that's the best you can hope for.  Not true!  This NOW Foods almond flour is soft.  Bob's also has a distinct flavor to it...when I made GAPS banana bread, the recipe calls for 3 cups of almond flour, and I used to substitute 2 cups of coconut flour, because I didn't like the result with 3 cups of Bob's almond flour.  With the NOW Foods almond flour, I PREFER it with only almond flour.<br /><br />If you're doing GAPS, it's kind of tough because you can't have grains.  Almond flour is one of the ingredients that makes it possible to have ""normal"" food while on GAPS.  My other favorite ingredients that make GAPS food taste like normal food are coconut flour and date sugar.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is EXCELLENT stuff!  If you've tried Bob's and didn't really care for it, definitely order this and see if you like it better.  As a bonus, the NOW Foods almond flour is slightly cheaper than Bob's, and the packages have actually been updated, so it looks more modern than the picture that is on the Amazon page.",1
"I decided to try this out based on other reviews and I was lookinng for a healthier oil.  The flavor this oil provides, along with Flavocol butter salt, is great.  I have had my popcorn maker for three years and popped over 100 pounds of popcorn and this is the best oil I have ever used.  After using half of my one gallons I am happy to recommend this product as a great oil for tasty, movie theater tasting oil.  It is very thin so you have to be careful pouring it unlike coconut oil or ActII which are usually thick. Happy popping!!",1
I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey...,1
"I will say that I was a bit skeptical when I first got the coffee pods, having tried several, various other pods in the past that were less than what anyone would expect for the price. However, to my pleasant surprise, the Marley Coffee was VERY GOOD. It has a very organic taste to it, with slight floral overtones and a smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste. I use the pods in my SENSEO coffee machine and the pods work quite well with it, producing a glorious crema every time. I would recommend this coffee, especially to owners of the SENSEO. Marley Coffee is good stuff!",1
"The spice variety is one of my favorites-- it has a nice cinammon quality without being too overpowering like a lot of spice teas i've had. also, guayusa is a pretty amazing product in itself. Big thumbs up.",1
"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.",1
"... because:<br />- They taste better. The others I've tried were ""Yes! to cookies"" (a bit sour), ""HealthSmart Chocolite Cookies & Cream"" (better classified as candies than cookies), and ""Andre's Carbo-Save"" (these come close to Lucienne's taste-wise).<br />- Unlike those other products, Lucienne's cookies are safe in terms of intestinal side effects: no FOS (such as inulin or oligofructose) no polydextrose, no isomalt.<br />- Unlike those others, Lucienne's cookies are dairy-free (and legume-free unlike Andre's).<br /><br />These cookies aren't too tempting, however. I've had truly addictive cookies made from almond and coconut flour, as well as a variation made from almond butter (those aren't sold online yet). But those addictive cookies would make me forget all the real foods, such as fruits and veggies. So I'm glad that Lucienne's cookies aren't doing this to me.",1
"Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!",1
This is the obnoxiously hot with a lot of flavor. A bottle usually lasts me a year. If your looking for a sauce that is very hot but has some sweetness (and is not overwhelmed with the smokey ashtray taste that many Habanero sauces have). This is the best tasting and most versatile HOT sauce that I have found. I use it in everything from tacos to tomato soup.,1
"I use this in my Senseo coffee maker, and, surprisingly, it tastes as good or better than most non-decaffeinated coffees I have drunk.  It costs just a little less than the Senseo brand of decaf, which I have not tried yet, but I am very pleased with this brand--best defaf I have ever tasted.",1
Life can actually get better but for chocolate and liquor lovers such as my close friend [this was a Christmas gift] this is all she needed to make her holiday. I was so happy to find something of such great quality at such a low price.,1
"If you love Chai, you will love this tea.  I cannot get it anymore at my local grocery stores.  It is not too strong and not too weak - just right.  It comes in the round tea bags like Republic of Tea uses.  We have extra large cups that are the size of 2 coffee cups, and one tea bag is fine for the double cup.  Just let it rest a little bit longer.  Good with or without milk.  Have not tried it yet as iced tea, but plan to soon.  Since it is herbal, it is great before bed.",1
"Easy to make.  Extra noodles, mmmmm.<br />The kids really love it and so do I.  Yummy!",1
"This is hands down the best cup of coffee. It helps me not drink a whole pot of coffee, because 1) It is too expensive to drink more than one via a morning. Even though I often cheat and have two. 2) It is so satisfying, i don't need to sit and drink 4 cups of okay coffee to get a good coffee fix. Great product. And AWESOME to travel with. So you can go anywhere and have a great cup of coffee.",1
"The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste ""slightly"" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version.

"A great coffee for every day... make it with less water for a delightful espresso, and add more water for that great americano coffee.  It;s not too bold, and its not a weak coffee - which I hate, so enjoy the versatility of this brand.  I mostly use it as an espresso with scalded milk, or cheat with a dollop of whipped cream and a hint of cinnamon on the top.  Any way you use it - you will love its bold flavor and satisfying taste without bitterness and odd aftertaste.  You can buy this with confidence and you will love it.  Many happy days of coffee moments will come from this delightful brand.",1
"This green tea is delicious. My new diet calls for green tea or coffee only. I am not a coffee drinker and usually drink ice tea. This green tea is perfect hot or cold! I use Stevia and it taste perfect. With the cooler months upon us, this will make a great hot drink to sip on...not to mention the benefits of green tea! Buy it...you won't be disappointed!",1
These jelly beans tasted like the real thing.  The kids had fun tasting the different and some disgusting flavors (like dirt flavor for example).  I ordered more boxes!,1
"I came across this after getting emailed some coupons including one for Jolly Time from Amazon.<br />There were only a few reviews but everyone seemed to like it, so I ordered a case along with another flavor....<br />I was so bummed I didn't buy 2 of these.<br /><br />Now keep in mind it's a little messy, but it washes right off your fingers.<br />This stuff is great, nice sweet flavor but not over-powering.<br />Makes your microwave give off a marshmallow scent for a few days after which makes you want more of it.<br /><br />Only problem I have with it is it seems to cook very fast, like almost a minute faster that other kinds of Jolly Time popcorn.<br />And it seems to be very easy to burn.<br /><br />But I did order another 2 cases of it when it got back in stock; so I must have liked it.",1
"We have tried several kinds of gluten free bread for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a bread machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake, if the crust gets too brown the bread dries out too quick.  Keep in the fridge after the second day as it will mold after about 4-5 days, but will last alot longer in the fridge.",1
"Delicious, flavorful tea.  A must for cinnamon lovers.  It also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who don't use sweeteners can enjoy. Wonderful as a hot drink, but I especially like it as a cold drink.",1
"That's about it - yum!  These are always out of stock at the grocery store too.  Kids will even eat these things - even though they're full of protein and ""good stuff.""  I cannot say enough good about these bars, they really are that good.  You can't miss with these things.  Highly, highly recommend!",1
"My little cockapoo loves Newman's Own dog treats, especially the peanut butter flavor. She'll usually eat anything, but I feel better about giving her treats that are healthy, organic, and made with high-quality ingredients that I could eat. No by-products here! Great price & highly recommended.",1
"at first, i thought i wouldn't like these.  i like fig newtons but i don't love them.  however, i couldn't be more pleased.  first of all, my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie.  i immediately checked the ingredients and yep, there's oats in there !  absolutely delicious.<br />there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it's not like a spread.  now i am not sure if  it's supposed to be spread between 2 thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kinda hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley, there is very little fig so it's not that big of a deal.  i couldn't taste the honey but that's ok. i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that.  they are a nice size and crisp.  i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious.  my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too.  he didn't even taste the fig.<br />these are very good however, if you really really want to taste fig, get the regular fig newtons.",1
"It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.",1

My whole family loves the strawberry toaster pastries.  I feel better knowing that they are eating something with a real fruit filling versus a filling that is made of flavored high fructose corn syrup.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.  They are sweet enough to not need any frosting.,1
"This is one of my favorite snacks. The peanuts are really large, nice and crunchy, have just the right amount of salt, and have a delicious flavor.<br /><br />Kirkland is the Costco brand. I buy these at my local Costco for just under nine dollars. The current price on Amazon is much higher.",1
Nu-Salt is the closest substitute product to real salt when used in baking or cooking.  It is white like salt not brown....,1

"I totally LOVE these bars! If you're looking for a protein bar that is low in calories and fat but high in protein, you HAVE to try these. In fact, try them anyway, even if you're not into high protein, because they're awesome!  The other bonus for me is that they are milk and gluten-free. But even if you don't have milk or gluten issues, you'll love these bars.  My other protein bars are so high in calories that I can only eat 1/2 of the bar at a time, but with these, I get the whole bar without the guilt! Plus, The Simply Bar gives me twice as much protein than my other protein bars. The other thing that I like is the fact that the ingredients list isn't a mile long with stuff that I don't even recognize. These are made with very few ingredients, all healthy.<br /><br />On top of all that good nutrition stuff, The Simply Bar looks and tastes like you're eating a rice krispy treat, so you totally feel like you're getting a treat! I love this Cocoa Coffee flavor, but I've also tried the cinnamon and lemon flavors and liked them just as much, so I would recommend trying them all.  I'm looking forward to the ""sampler"" pack becoming available so I can mix and match them more easily.  I'm in Texas and The Simply Bar is not yet sold in stores down here, so it was great news to hear they were on Amazon.  Enjoy!",1
"I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family.",1

"My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!",1
"My cat, PONCHO, loves this food. He's one of those especially finicky cats too. The food is not overprocessed and sure to please the most particular of cats. Overall, a gourmet cat food at a reasonable price. Meow.",1
"These Bergin Cashew nuts are excellent quality and have such flavour! A great product to add to your nutritional profile, rich in omega's and so many other nutrients. Reviewed by [...]",1
My dog loves these healthy treats! Great quality for the price and no worries about the recent food scare.,1
"The 3 Musketeers bar has been a staple of the Mars candy company since it was introduced in 1932. At that time, the 3 Musketeers were three little candy bars with different flavored nougat - chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Well, it was found that the chocolate was by far the most popular, so the other bars went away, and the 3 Musketeers became one bar.<br /><br />3 Musketeers is a great, soft candy bar that weighs in at 2.13 ounces, and has 260 calories and 8 grams of fat. It does not contain nuts, which makes it a good choice in case anyone you know has a nut allergy, and it does not contain caramel, which makes it a good choice for kids with braces. (Heck, when I had my braces, 3 Musketeers became my candy bar of choice, and it still has a favored spot in my sweet-tooth!)<br /><br />This is a great tasting candy bar, and a good choice if you are buying candy bars for others - such as a soccer team, or whatnot. I highly recommend this classic candy bar!",1
"Newman's Own Organic Pretzels are far better than any other pretzel I've eaten. As most probably know, any product Newman's Own produces is superior to competitor brands. My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.",1
Coffee arrived before said arrival date and everything is as advertised. I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes the K cup.,1
I have been doing low carb. These are great. I can finally have a drink that tastes great without feeling quilty. Thanks,1
I am in my 60's and this is something my mother used to make for us as kids and we loved.  Thought it was discontinued until I found it on Amazon.  Split this with my family and this will bring back great memories of Holidays Past.<br />Thank you Amazon and keep this on the list of products.  Betty Crocker keep making this product.  Not sure why you can't find on store shelves anymore but I have been looking for years! Now I found a source.,1
"If you love pineapple, you won't be disappointed by this item. About half the can is sweet pinapple juice, the other half, nice bite sized chunks to eat. Even my cat liked these, because he would lick at them in my hand and eat them.<br /><br />Stay away from the ""crushed"" variety though, which isn't crushed at all, and is more like a disguisting slush. But this ""chunks"" variety is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.",1
"I've had my Keurig for almost a year and have not been happy with the wimpy strength of the K-cups.  Emeril's  ""Big Easy Bold"" delivers a good strong cup of coffee.  Hooray!!",1
"I like sardines and have tried many different brands.  These are, hands down, the best Sardines on the market.  Very tasty, no bones in a light olive oil.  Highly recommended.  Good source of Omega 3's as well.",1
"How do I review a cereal?  It's something you either like or don't.  I have had a lot of trouble getting this cereal locally, so I get it here.  If you like the chex mix snack food, you will probably like this cereal",1
"Nevermind what was said about the lemon..Hummus is supposed to be seasoned with lemon???...ans LOTS and LOTS of Olive Oil too!  This is by far the BEST ""instant"" Hummus mix ever, and I have tried quite a few in my time.  It makes a party size (15-20 peeps) serving and leaves the bowl licked clean..everytime!  Try it you won't be disappointed..unless you don't like lemon??? (Who doesn't like lemon?)  By the way, I squeeze a BIG OL' HUNK of lemon all over mine after it has chilled :)",1
"This is a great product to help you get the essential antioxidants/vitamins, etc in your diet.<br />A friend of mine introduced me to this and I try to make it at least 2x a day.<br />You MUST dissolve the first 1 oz. in cold water, otherwise it's a pretty bad mix.<br />Keep the container in the fridge for freshness.<br />I mix mine with Zico dark chocolate coconut water (just 1/4 cup) and the rest cold water.  It adds a little more flavor but without too much added sugar or calories.<br />When I travel, I take along the small packets of Green SuperFood and try to find coconut water for mixing.  (This is great because it's even more difficult to get veggies/greens when you are far from home)",1
This is a great tasting organic bar.  Great when you're on the go or pre or post workout.  I buy them a lot for road trips.,1
"WOW.  NOTE:  No Wheat, Corn, Soy, Artificial Colors, Flavors and no Added Fat or By-Products.  On the Label, the first ingredient is Peanut Butter.  Made in USA.<br /><br />My chihuahua loves these things.  Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.  Will be keeping these around for sure.",1
"Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut is the best K-Cup Hazelnut and I have tried them all. We ordered this large pack, because we sadly found out that Wolfgang Puck is discontinuing many (not all) of their K-Cups, including this flavor. Buy this while you can!",1
"I've been a serious black tea drinker my whole life, thanks to a British mom. She bought this tea for me as a christmas present last year. I have since ordered more online. It's seasonal around December but you can still find it here on Amazon or on other websites. I now have a few tins in stock. This is a lovely spiced black tea mix that does very well with some honey and milk or on it's own (it's not too bitter).<br /><br />A lovely tea for a cold morning or after a long day of work.<br /><br />love it. will continue to buy more.",1
I've tried several other brands but only this brand actually makes it right. I don't even like mango! But this brand's dried mango is my favorite food.,1
"Bought this for my uncle who loves his horseradish!  Since the room cleared out after he opened the jar I assumed it had potency, but the look on his face after a sample proved it was the stuff of legend.  If you're a 'radish fan you won't be disappointed!",1
I was introduced to this by a co-worker and I couldn't get enough!! I never knew these sweets existed.  Delicious!,1
"I love peppermint, and the holidays would not be complete for me without a variety of marvelous minty treats! King Leo has been making peppermint sticks for over 100 years, and the dark blue tin with its royal lion logo is always a most welcome sight. This is a wonderful gift, but you must also buy one for yourself. There is something very soothing about taking the time to enjoy a peppermint stick. We all deserve the ""me time"" and this is a delightfully simple way to make that happen.",1
I LOVE this cookie and can't find it.  Sooo I would like a notification when it's available.,1
"I try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch.  I really enjoy all of Kay's chips and pretzels but keep in mind that, of course, there will be textural and taste differences from the ""real"" thing.",1
"This is the best k-cup coffee I've had.  Its bold smooth flavor is great for bkfst, but just as good to enjoy w/desserts or an afternoon pick-me-up.  I love it!",1
Love this herbal tea! It's so delicious! It tastes just like Oolong Tea from the chinese restaurant minus the unhealthy tannins found in actual tea!,1
"As far as single serve cocoas go, this is one of the best.  I wouldn't say it's as good as some of the handmade ones, but it's still good!",1
"As the other review(s) pointed out, it's a bit pricey, but I was unable to find this product locally where I live. I like to buy it when I have Amazon gift certificates saved up, and then the price really isn't much of an issue. It works really well in some gluten free baking recipes.",1
I love free shipping thru Prime. The item came the next day as advertised. If you've ever used a Keurig then you know these are must haves.,1
"We tried (and retried very may times :) these chocolates in Belgium, and they are fantastic. I do like Neuhaus chocolates better, but these are also way up there. Highly recommended!",1
The supplier was great in delivering products in good condition.  Love these chips and even my grandchildren like them.<br /><br />It doesn't last long even when you buy by the case.,1
"I must agree with the other 2 reviews. My cats are so-o-o-o-o picky but they never turn up their noses when I offer these treats.<br /><br />My cats refuse almost every other treat I offer. Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.",1
"My girlfriend loves European milk chocolate and I got this for her. She loves it, and I am a happy dude.<br /><br />Its very smooth, almost melt in your mouth, and there is no small grains at all.",1
"I didn't expect to get so many treats!!! They're small but perfect for training, and my dog loves them! She already learned how to roll over and play dead with these treats. Definitely worth the price. Buy the 1 pound, peanut butter bag, and your dog will love you!",1
The dog just loves these chewy biscuits. A friend gave them as a holiday gift and I have searched all over for them. Glad Amazon came thru for me once again!,1
"I prefer the taste of this Soy Drink on cereal in the morning! It's the best in my opinion. I use it in every recipe that calls for milk. It does tend to make mashed potatoes taste like Vanilla, but I can live with that. When my co-ops stopped stocking this particular flavor/brand I panicked, but I found it on Amazon and have been very happy, especially since I order a couple of cases at a time. Amazon delivers this quickly, and I have never had a problem with their service.",1
"I wanted to note that these are the best-tasting, raw lemon cookies I have ever tried. I will not use banal frases such as ""they are good for you"" or anything like that. I will just mention that they leave me satisfied and with a joyful feeling inside. I can feel that these raw cookis are made with love, and I will definitely purchase them again.",1
"I bought these for my son's 12th birthday party favor/goodie bag.  It's hard to put together a goodie bag for 12 year old boys, but this is something that everyone likes!",1
I have been ordering this tea for over 5 years now.  It is the best.  I recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys Earl Grey.,1
"These taste so good, that I've found myself eating them more than my daughter!! Not like regular animal cookies --- a million times better!",1
"I'm a big peanut butter consumer but was on the lookout for a lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, then I found PB2.  This stuff makes it very convenient to add extra protein and flavor to your diet at any time of the day.  No mixing thick, oily peanut butter is really nice.  Or, wondering what the other 10% of the ingredients are in that off-the-shelf brand of peanut butter. The single packages are pretty expensive, so I think next time I will be ordering the twelve pack of 6.5 ounce bottles instead.",1
I dont personally know this stuff is but my cooks were requesting  so I ordered some. I guess I could say that the food tastes better now. I mean what else is there to say about a spice!,1
"There is really not much to say other than this delicious candy is a sweet bargain!  This is the same candy you buy in the ""dolled up"" specialty candy store at the mall that they sell for 2-3 times the price per pound.  We have all gotten the little plastic bag at the store and thought we were going to buy just a little bit of this candy, only to find out it costs an arm and a leg when you checked out. This candy came fresh, delicious and at a money saving value.  Highly recommended!",1
"To mix one cup liquid milk with Carnation, Saco, or Sunney Select use 1/3 cup (3-1/2 ouces) powder.<br /><br />W`ith this product (Bobs Red Mill) use 1 ounce of powder (2 tablespoons).<br /><br />Therefore this product stores more compactly, don't let the small container size fool you.<br /><br />This product also makes a better tasting drinking milk.<br /><br />Unfortuneately it does not mix up as easily as the other brands.<br /><br />Two out of three!<br /><br />-----<br />I found a way to mix this easy in 2 seconds:use the Aerolatte Milk Frother. Longer will whip it, one second does it! No stirring or shaking can do this like this thing can!<br /><br />[...]",1
"We have quite a few treat dispenser toys, and our 10 pound chihuahua mix LOVES food, so of course, she loves these toys. We feed her lunch and breakfast with the toys. Unfortunately, they were starting to get too easy for her. We have the large Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, which she loves, but she gets the food out so quickly that we needed something more challenging. This mini classic buster cube fits her (and our) needs. Similar idea, but since it is more difficult for her to roll and move the cube, she has to play with it longer. So far, it is holding up well and she enjoys it. I highly recommend this toy if you want something more challenging for your dog.",1
"My family is gluten free because we have to be. I've used this product several times with great success. Last night I wanted to make a cake but didn't have any frosting mix and the butter was hard and I didn't want to wait for it to soften. So I made the mousse and chilled it, then used it as frosting on the cake and jam for between the layers. This cake won't survive breakfast even!",1
I have used Blue Buffalo food for years. It really is the best out there. Great for dogs with allergies to all the junk in other dog foods. I started using this when I adopted an old senior brittany some years ago. Her cloudy eyes cleared up and her coat became nice and shiny again rather than dull. I won't use anything else and with Amazon Prime...I don't even have to lift into a cart at the pet store and then haul into my house. Fed Ex leaves it right on my kitchen porch.,1
Reed's Crystallized Ginger is the real deal! It's natural and basically just ginger with sugar. 1 piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc.,1
After dinner I always tell my wife that I need a 'light cookie snack'.  These are the perfect solution to that request!  Simply delicious; very flavorful and highly recommended.,1
"This coconut oil was a good price, arrived promptly, and was just as described. I used this coconut oil in cold-process soap making, and it worked wonderfully.",1
"Ordered as a Mother's Day gift.  Tree was delivered in a million packing peanuts in perfect condition.  It is watered every day and is doing wonderfully.  Great experience, great Tree.  Highly Recommend.",1
"I had been looking everywhere for Chew Lotta Bones and finally ordered them through Amazon.  My Standard Poodle, Mocha Java, is a ""power chewer"" and these last her about an hour. Does she ever love them!!!  They are a bit pricey ($3 each) so next time I hope I can order the medium sized ones.",1
This is the best tea I have ever tasted in my life!  It is so delicate yet so flavorful.  I have not bothered to drink any other tea in 2 years.,1
"This is the best marinade.  Steaks come out tender and the flavor is absolutely great.  Even though the directions say to let the steaks sit 15 minutes, the longer you let the steaks sit, the better.",1
"Whoever likes the natural product, this drink is for you. It's like you just split a coconut and drink from inside. I personally prefer Nirvana brand, because it's a little bit more sweet.",1
"I've tried all of my local supermarkets, Target and Wal-Mart.  The only place I could find this cereal is Amazon. Go Amazon!! I've been looking for this cereal for a while now.  I used to love it as a kid and I was pleased to find out that I still do.  The only negatives are that there aren't as many big chunks as there were in the past and the little bits tend to get soggy very quickly.  This cereal is really sweet so be careful because you can easily get tired of them quickly.  I love em though.  Perfectly sweet and crunchy.",1
"This was my first experience with blooming tea, and it made me into an enthusiastic believer!  My boyfriend had wanted me to look for chrysanthemum tea, without caffeine, at the new Teavana store at one of the local malls, and this was the tea I was told had the most chrysanthemum in it.  It looks absolutely beautiful when it blooms underwater, it smells wonderful, and it has a wonderful peach and jasmine flavor.  Unlike traditional teabags, teaballs can be used for at least three brewings, and one ball is even enough to brew an entire pot of tea.  This particular blooming tea might be on the pricy side for just two ounces, but in the long run it saves more money than getting a lot of teabags that might be cheaper but which can only be used for one cup of tea and still retain much flavor.  This tea still packs its full flavor after the first use and after the first day!  This was also my first time experiencing white tea, which, as it turns out, is lowest in caffeine of any of the other types of tea and is the highest in antioxidants.  And the fancy teaballs just make one want to brew this tea, since the presentation is so much prettier and more elegant-looking than a regular teabag, which one just throws in a cup of hot water.  It also helps that in Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is believed to have the power to help a drinker to live to one hundred!",1
"True to its ad-its a smooth and mellow coffee.  As it supports a good cause as well, my taste buds and my conscience are happy.",1
"These are very tasty, and you can find these udon noodles at most stores. I really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor.",1
"great deal, these are so yummy , we love them for snacks ,for school and with soup",1
"The boyfriend rated this ""restaurant quality"" so totally worth it as it is extremely easy to fix. I took the suggestion of another customer and used the brownie pan that is all edges and it turned out perfectly with 2 boxes of mix.  Added nuts to the mix and it accomodated nicely.",1
Our 2 kittens who are now 5 months old love Wellness Canned Kitten Food. They lick their dishes clean. And I feel very  good giving them a healthy food to eat.<br /><br />I've been so happy with the canned food orders I've placed with Petco. Have had trouble with orders coming from other companies arriving dented. Petco packages them very well and I have not received one dented can yet. Fast shipping too.,1
I just racked this to secondary. I did taste it and it is good and it is dry. Sometimes I like a dry wine so I will probably take a gallon and do a little sweetening with some simple syrup (maybe add a tbsp of orange extract)like a previous poster did.,1
This product does everything that was advertised. I am a diabetic and had been looking for something other than the sweeteners found in the grocery stores.<br />All I can say is that this product workse as advertised and that I am completely  satisfied.,1
"I first tried Fiji Water back in college when our cafeteria used to sell these at $2 a bottle for the mini size. I always wondered what the difference between Fiji and cheaper Poland Spring were. However, it all came down to taste. For me, Fiji Water tastes great. It doesn't have that tap water taste and it goes down smoothly. I drink Fiji whenever I can.<br /><br />Back when Amazon had it for around less than $30 (for this pack), I used to have these shipped every month under the subscribe and save. Ever since the price went up, I stopped and lugged this 12 pack from the Supermarket all the time. It was significantly cheaper. Fast forward a year and now that my wife is pregnant, I always have this size Fiji Water on hand at all time. This is the only water she will drink. Even though the cost is significantly higher, it is well worth it because I don't have to strain my back to lug 3-4 of these cases from the supermarket to my house. With subscribe and save, they get delivered right to my door and that is price-less. I no longer have to drive 20 minutes there and 20 minutes back to get them.<br /><br />As far as the size goes, it is perfect. I started with the mini ones, but we would end up having more empty plastic bottles laying around the house. Then, I switched to this size, 1-2 bottle(s) last the whole day and we would end up having less plastic. =) Comparing ounce wise, this is the cheapest.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Amazing water taste<br />+ Wife loves it<br />+ Water never exposed to anything until I open the bottle<br />+ Free shipping for delivery to your door! Woo hoo!<br /><br />CONS:<br />+ Expensive when compared to local supermarkets<br /><br />If you are like me and don't have the time to drive out to the supermarket or simply care about your back, Amazon delivers!",1
"My alternative medicine doc, who is also an MD, recommended this product due to my leukemia.  There was a study by the Mayo Clinic of patients with CLL  [my form of the disease]  and there were some statistical data showing benefits for CLL patients who took a green tea extract -- strength not specified by the Mayo Clinic.  I ordered this product as soon as I was diagnosed, and found immediate relief from swolen glands, and night sweats.  I contacted the manufacturer, using the info on the label, and they have oncologists as consultants. The response to my question: ""how much can I take?"" came back as 3 times daily.<br /><br />Five months later, swelling is minimal, night sweats rare.  Doctor says my WBC is stable....  Those results are hard to dispute, in my opinion.<br /><br />Given the info above -- this is a great product, full of good anti-oxidents, but with some minimally proven benefits for CLL patients, like me.<br /><br />Shipping was extremely prompt, so I couldn't have asked for more from them.<br /><br />Five stars!!!",1
"I bought these for my wife becuase she loves these pops, and although I don't have the sweet tooth she does, I have to agree that these are tastier than most I've tried. We were buying them from a local candy store, but they were expensive and they didn't always carry them in stock, so I bought this pack for her birthday, saving money and ending up with a nice reserve. She likes all the flavors, which is unusual because usually there is one or two flavors in a box of candies that she doesn't. Anyway, these are more expensive than most pops, but her happiness is worth it.",1
I use beef boullion cubes in many of my cooking recipes. I have a great Beef & Barley Vegetable Soup that I make... my own recipe...and these beef boullion cubes are a staple in that soup. Use in other cooking dishes also. Amazon was swift in filling this order and the price was great.  Will order again when this container gets down to the last half-dozen cubes.,1
Both my lab and her best friend (lab/border collie) prefer these bully sticks over any other treat.,1
"This cereal is very hard to find in grocery stores and thanks to Amazon my daughter always has it. It is very nutritious, tastes great and is easily digestable for babies. Thanks Amazon for making it available.",1
"This mix makes nice chocolate chip muffins; they are a bit bland without the chocolate chips. I double the vanilla. For those customers with the browning issues: try lowering your oven rack, and baking a bit longer than recommended. With some experimentation, I now get nice golden brown muffins.<br /><br />These aren't super-easy for a mix - you need to add a fair number of ingredients. But they are tasty, and relatively simple to make. My kids like them a lot. They also freeze well.",1
I have used this Tea for some years.  I do not like fu fu wimpy green tea at anytime.<br />If you want a Robust Black tea but with all the edges smoothed.  The Lichee fruit sweetens this hardy black tea - makes it smooth.  I do not use sugar or anything in my tea.  If you put anything in this tea you are wasting the best tea made.  I drink it hot or at room temperture. I am a purest about this tea - it does not need anything added.  I quit using sugar in tea when I was 15.  You can not appreciate the full flavor if you add anything to this perfect tea.  This is the only food product I buy that is maded in China. It can not be beat.  If you can find a better Black Tea let me know.<br />On coffee I am not a purest.  I like any very dark strong coffee with half & Half and<br />truvia.  In France use two creams and truvia and cut with knife and Fork.,1
I absolutely love truvia - unfortunately you cannot buy this in bulk yet (at a good price) in any of the local stores.,1
"The Calorie Control drink powders are a great alternative to Crystal Light, etc. They taste great and can be bought in bulk so you save some money.",1
My cat simply loves this product. He just can not get enough of it. It is a great treat for a fussy eater.,1
"Chocolate is good for you!  At least a high percentage cacao chocolate, consumed in moderation, can provide some healthy benefits; not to mention the emotional stroke that comes from savoring a delicious product like this.  The flavor is rich and without any hint of waxiness that often sullies ""common"" chocolate bars.  But then you would expect high quality from Scharren Berger anyway.<br /><br />Since my own chocolate tasting abilities are fair at best (at least I didn't embarrass myself at the one chocolate tasting I went to), I shared this with my wife, sister-in-law and daughter... serious chocohalics all!  The verdict was unamimous with mine.  More impressively so when you consider the fact that my daughter is known to question restaurant chef's as to whether they used Girhardelli or a Belgian chocolate in their recipe.  Suffice to say, she knows what she's talking about, and she was very impressed!",1
"It is full of sweet air. Very light to the bite, my taste buds screamed of joy with all this mild yet sweet texture.",1
"I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M ""M"" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it's not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don't have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can't find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon.",1
"These are really great bars.  They're not for everybody, but if you enjoy Mojo bars, or anything similar with nuts and/or seeds.  A bit hard, so if you're looking for something soft, this isn't for you.  Probably something you should try before getting a big package of them.  I have purchased them at Whole Foods before.  You may be able to get singles here as well.",1
My son has been eating this since he started solid foods and he enjoys it.  The price is bulk is far better than what we pay for singles at Target or Kroger.,1
The flavorful little candy shapes are addictive to me! I plan to buy another 5 lb bag very soon because I keep buying out the stores around my area.,1
"I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased it since the Neuro representatives were so friendly. As per their warning, I did not try it until I got home that evening.<br /><br />I sat down at the computer and started chatting with a few out-of-state friends and my husband, who was also out-of-state. I opened the bottle and started absently sipping, as I would the ever-present glass of water on my desk. Nobody was curious about what I was drinking (through virtue of Google's Hangout) until I said, ""Whoa...I need to stop drinking this."" I was halfway through the bottle, and my head was feeling heavy. Upon inquiry, I showed my friends the bottle and they looked it up. Being the geeks we are, they recited the ingredients and laughed, ""Of course this is going to make you sleepy!""  I retaliated, ""I didn't read the label because this stuff NEVER works!""<br /><br />Well, it does work.  And I didn't experience the groggy hang-over I get from Tylenol PM. If they'd sell in glass bottles, this line would be perfect.",1
"I'm not sure that its healthy, but my cat loves this brand and flavor more than anything else on earth! She's about to turn 18 and really doesn't eat much unless I give her this stuff.",1
"In ayurvedic medidicne and in yoga exxercises some times you need to use herbal meds for balancing the chakras and energy channels, so this is one of the needed ones<br />but please use under instruction of your yoga and ayurvedic teacher",1
"I am a first time dog owner and wanted to ensure that my 2 Presa Canarios were fed a good dog food.  From my research Canidae dog food was one of the best listed.  In addition the ""Grain Free"" caught my eye, since I was contemplating going to a raw diet.  From my research the Canidae ""Grain Free"" formula is as close as you can get to ""natural"" diet without committing to raw food.  Great product and my dogs love it.. Now I must admit there will be flatulence, and it can be rough at times... (Ha!, Ha!). But the overall health and well fare of the dog is my main concern....",1
Super Bubble Bubble Gum is the best.  It's fresh and the flavor lasts a long time. It's just a hair better than Bazooka.,1
This is the one to get!  Pleasant taste that quenches your thirst without being too sweet.,1
I bought these pecans for my Aunt because she cooks a lot.  She LOVED them!  GREAT taste!,1
"The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.<br /><br />I bought the Multigrain Hot Cereal the first time by accident instead of the steel cut oats but decided to try it rather than return it and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It contains rolled whole grain rye, barley, oats, and wheat in that order.  It is a great hot breakfast on a chilly morning and a nice change from oatmeal.  I like it slightly undercooked and topped with a sliced banana and raisins with a splash of milk.<br /><br />As far as nutrition, a half cup has 5g of fiber!<br /><br />Even if you don't like oatmeal, you might want to give this a try.",1
"Sugar free, great taste, pretty long lasting.  Not a lot to say about gum.  I like it a lot.",1
"I drink at least 1 gal. of water a day. I've tried sooo many brands. Some are impossible, many are acceptable but very few are exceptional...Glaceau Smartwater with electrolytes tops the charts! This water is great with meals, during & after exercise, just because you're thirsty or if dieting, it helps fill you up if you drink a bottle 20 minutes or so before eating while helping to keep your electrolytes in balance! This is of great importance. When your electrolytes are ""off"", it can affect your heart as well as other important medical conditions. This is why scientists came up with Gatorade for pro athletes 25 yrs. or so ago. Look what we've learned since then! Thank you for a superior product!",1
My husband and I made the decision a few months ago to stop feeding our kids crap....after all you are what you eat! The difference in our lives is AMAZING. Not only do we see the weight benifits of it our childrens behaviour changes are amazing. After taste testing alot of different breakfast products we found and fell in love with Kashi. Finally something healthy that doesn't taste like cardboard...WWOOOHHOOO! Even my kids love these bars. Thay are great with a fruit smoothy in the morning for a quick on the go breakfast or a quick afternoon snack. I do have to say I can get a case of 24 at Sam's club for $18.84 so they are a little cheaper their. I encourage you to try all their products...we have yet to try one we don't like.,1
"This company is great, they shipped super fast and the vanilla beans were plump, fragrant, and tasty. I've always seen recipes that just casually called for a vanilla bean or two and just looked at them longingly, since in the store just one will set you back seven or more bucks. I was skeptical at first because of the price but once they arrived...wow. I knew they were here because when I opened my mailbox the delicate, floral aroma of vanilla wafted out (and yes, they were well packed!) and you can even see the difference between these and those little shriveled things in vials at the grocery store. When my supply of beans runs out I will definitely do business with this company again!",1
Was having a tough time getting my kids to drink tea and water vs. soda.  Replaced one of these tea bags with a regular one and they love it!  Me too!,1
"I love this flavor of tea, and getting a huge box of it was fantastic.  Though, what I received was a standard amazon box with 100 individually wrapped tea bags loose in it, so I had to find something to store them in in my cabinet.",1
I have had other Mrs. May products from Costco before. The amazon price is a great deal and the tropical bars have a really good taste!,1
Exquisite box and beautiful delicious teas.  My mother raved over this.  She wants to keep the box for her jewelry beading.,1
"I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart. I highly recommend it, but ask your local grocers to see if they're willing to carry it. This is far too expensive than what I paid going to my grocery store.",1
The reveiw by Evelyn jumped to the conclusion that all chicken tender products from China are bad when in fact it was only one retailers private label that was recalled.<br />I have used Smokehouse Chicken Tenders for years because of the low fat high protein snack that is great in the field.<br />When I first heard of the isolated problem I contacted Smokehouse to see if I need to be concerned. They said they have always quarantined and tested all imported ingridents for quality and contamination and only release those that meet their high standards. My dogs will continue to enjoy this great product.,1
"I love Eden Organic products - I will not buy any other canned product AT ALL. I recommend that anyone interested buy them at amazons price - you won't find a better one. There isn't much one can say about red beans. But I can tell you that this is a high quality product that you can feel good (and safe) about eating and feeding to your family. If we start buying more of these products, we will see a greater variety offered, lower prices and maybe other (not safe) brands will take notice and follow Eden's practices when it comes to canning their food safely. Eden is the only one on the market that can truly claim to be safe. Even other organic brand canned foods are tainted by their poisonous cans. You're wasting your money there. Go Eden and you can sleep soundly at night.",1
"I have done MUCH research on different meal replacement shakes and this one hands down stands out from the rest.  The Iced Cafe Mocha flavor is the best!  Over ice, w/ a hint of nutmeg - there is nothing like it.  My husband couldn't believe the ingredients - top notch guys! Keep up the good work : )",1
"The K cups were loose and not bound in plastic wrap or cardboard box.  I was very happy to see that.  The K cups were not damaged in any way and is at least a little better for the environment given the use of them, by me, is not good for my carbon foot print. So every little bit helps.",1
"I have tried so many different bars (Kashi, Cascadian farms, others), but I have never had a better bar than this! It is great, not too sweet (a big deal for me) snack. It is also organic - what not to like?",1
"Full flavored, no nasty after-taste, hard to tell if is diet or not, overall one of the best Root Beers on the market.",1
This is a great alternative for GF baking. It is a fine texture and it is Organic which is hard to find in GF flours.,1
"This tea is the first cup I have in the morning.  Follow the directions with almost boiling water and a 5 minute steep.  I have not been successful using a bag more than once, however. A little stevia intensifies the flavor.  I always order an extra box so I never run out, a problem since I am often giving some to friends.",1
"This product comes well packaged, so that there is no brakeage during shipping.They are wonderful to fill, and make that special desert a snap to make. A big hit whenever I go to anyones house.I will order these again.",1
2 cats have pancreatitis and one of which has a chicken allergy (we think) and this is the only brand of food other than the prescription only stuff that the furballs like and is ok for them,1
"Very good.  Very tasty and authentic flavor!  I ordered these last minute for Christmas, not knowing if they were going to arrive on time.  They arrived at my house on Christmas Eve.",1
"If you're a real spicy food lover, Thai/Indian/Korean/Schezuan, then this is perfect for spicing up your American foods. It's all about matching sauces to foods and the flavor of this sauce perfectly compliments non-spicy staples such as pizza, burgers, and hot dogs.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown in scovilles:<br /><br />Tobasco Sauce = 2500 to 5000 depending on the batch.<br />Normal Jalapeno Pepper = 2500 to 5000<br />Cholula = 3600<br />Tobasco Habanero Sauce = 8000 to 9000<br />Dave's Insanity Sauce = 180,000<br />Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce = 250,000 (This is the one you're looking at)<br /><br />Hopefully the list above will help any newcomers decide whether or not this is for you.If you're new to the boutique hot sauce world then I'd suggest going for the regular Insanity Sauce first.<br /><br />And never forget for any new hot sauce, ""ONE DROP AT A TIME!!!!""",1
"I'm a little bit of Pop Chip addict, so was very excited to try a new flavor - I was afraid these would be too spicy as I'm not a huge spicy food lover but these are so yum - whole family loves them!",1
"These ""vanilla packets"" are essential for my mother-in-law's delicious Italian cookies. They really make a difference.",1
"I have recently learned that I need to be gluten-free.  These are by far the best GF product I've tried thus far.... In fact, my family, who are NOT GF, fight me for these!  (6 and 8 year old kids!)  I, of course always win, because they have other yummy stuff they can eat!  :)",1
My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows. Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs. Greenies. The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage. slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices.,1
"These are great!  Low calorie, light, crispy, great taste, and satisfying.  This is a staple snack item in my house!  Tons of dietary fiber and they taste great.  I recommend this to anyone who would like to replace the typical office bagel or donut.  Healthy and delicious.",1
This is a great strong French Roast. Love the fact that it is Organic! Our only complaint is that the great aroma it has when just ground doesn't translate to the actual brewed cup. Taste is flavorful and  full bodied. Great buy! I would buy it again.,1
"If you have problems with Aspartame (which is in every gum out there...not just sugarfree gums) and you love to chew gum then SteviaDent is really the only option unless you want to eat TicTacs.  It is really good although quite expensive, but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health.  I chewed every gum out there and lots of it, but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth. My immediate reaction was...of course cancer, but I had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not. Not only that, Aspartame upset my stomach to the point that I had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day.  I didn't initially attribute either of these things to Aspartame, but when I started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum, I started doing my research and Aspartame turned out to be the culprit. I ended up ordering a case of the SteviaDent and pitched everything I owned that contained Asapartame.  The lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away.  Worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with Stevia instead of Aspartame.",1
"This is the perfect combination for my home popper.  OK, I know it isn't good for you, but this is great, movie theater popcorn at it's best!",1
"If you haven't tried this Cajun seasoning, you're missing something very special.  The price is affordable and you receive a large container.",1
"Yummy. If it was any better, they'd have to make it illegal. I use a cuisinart home espresso machine with the average 15 bar pump. Nothing semi-pro or fancy about it. This espresso gives a decent layer of crema on top of my double shot. The beans are medium dark, and oily, but not overly so. The flavor is excellent, clean, acidic, bright. There is a nice tart bite at the back of the tongue.I make a tall capuccino (sort of a very short latte) with whole organic milk and microfoam. I haven't had a plain shot of the espresso because I don't usually drink it that way. Still, I am comparing the same style of drink that I always make with other brands of espresso beans. I'm very pleased! (I am a vine reviewer, but I bought this coffee and didn't receive it free for review).",1
"I was very pleased by this purchase.  I ordered this as well as other grains from Great River for use in my porridge which is healthy, cheap and tasty.  I have cooked them up in my rice steamer as well as stove top and they come out with great texture as well as flavor.  I would buy them more frequently if they didn't last so long.  (Review used for each grain as I am equally impressed with each)",1
This oil is as good as the Dr. Oz show said it would be. I use it for everything. It does not really have a flavor of it's own.It was very difficult to find in my area so I took a leap of faith and bought the jug full. The only other issue was that I had to have my husband buy me a transfer pump because you can't just pour out what you need. All in all a big hit in our house,1
I brought these crackers home from London.  My family liked them so much that I wanted to get more and was excited that I could get them at Amazon.com.,1
"All the other Herbs de Provence are imposters.  This is the only TRUE product that should bear the label, because as with all great French Epicurean items, there is a story with the Originale Recipe behind it.  If anyone using this product doesn't know the Story, it's definitely worth reading.  Thank you for carrying this product in the original crock in the large size.  I use it in almost everything; sometimes a very tiny pinch, others several large pinches, and Voila, Aux Anysetiers Du Roy!",1
Just a little makes many cups of delicious tea. It's my favorite loose leaf earl grey.,1
"This tea tastes amazing!  It is not too strong or too weak.  It has great flavor, it it smells divine!",1
"My first taste of Taza chocolate was their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L9WI76"">chili-flavored</a> candy - don't laugh, it works! That impessed me so much that I had to try more in their product line. This vanilla-infused offering meets the high standard set by my initial Taza experience.<br /><br />With only three ingredients (organic sugar, cacao bean, and vanilla), the flavors come through crisply and well-defined. They open up in layers, starting with the bittersweet darkness of the chocolate itself. The vanilla note follows, pronounced without overwhelming. The finish includes a fruity tartness, possibly with traces of citrus. That last flavor helps remind that chocolate is a flavor from nature, and that natural flavors have complexities that reveal themselves differently to different parts of the palate.<br /><br />It didn't surprise me this time: the sandy texture of the stone-ground cacao bean. Don't looks for Godiva silkiness here - the texture calls to mind the ancient Aztec preparation of this wonderful flavor. If you can learn to like that, Taza could easily become your favorite chocolate.<br /><br />-- wiredweird",1
"Such a great tea, glad to see it on Amazon since my local grocers don't carry it.  Totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is.<br />I love it iced, but my FIL likes it hot when he visits.",1

"I bought the peanut butter flavored treats for my 9 week old Lab puppy and she LOVES them. They are perfect for training. She has learned 3 commands in one day with these treats. I was also very pleased to see that the first ingredient is peanut butter, not enriched flour.",1
Dickens is almost seven years old and this is the only product that he will chew on.  He's a Cavachon with a determined appetite.  the CET Oral Hygiene Chews helps us keep his teeth clean.  Thank you for having a good product.,1
"Stash Licorice Spice tea is so soothing. I can't always drink a caffenated tea, although I love it. Before I have anything in my stomach, Licorice tea is wonderful and soothing. I can't find it anywhere else but at Amazon. It does not have a strong licorice flavor, which I know some people don't care for.",1
"These almonds are my favorite almonds.  Wal-Mart used to carry them, but now I have to order online.  They are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet.",1
"Brown's Pure Vermont Maple is simply the best syrup I've ever had. Well, you could probably do better if you sucked the sap right from the tree. The flavor is absolutely grand. I use this syrup on my morning oatmeal.<br /><br />I chose a Vermont maple syrup because of the stringent controls that the State of Vermont instills on it's maple syrup.<br /><br />Yummers!",1
"At the recommendation of my sister, I ordered this product through Amazon and got it within two days on the Prime program.  I Got two bags for less than one I had previous purchased at Wal-Mart.  I am loving it.  This is a great product to mix with smoothies for colon health.  It really does work for me especially the price.",1
I love Lipton's Diet Iced Tea.  Problem is my store does not seem to ever have it in stock!!<br /><br />This fit my needs entirely.,1
A friend of ours went to Belize and brought us back some Marie Sharp products.  This is the best stuff on<br />the planet.  It is spicy but so smooth.  We order it often and the service is fast.,1
"Yogi Tea's Mayan Cocoa Spice is a delicious blend of the spicy and sweet. Imagine the legendary Mexican mole in a cup of tea. As mole is a blend of spices with cocoa, so it is with this tea. It's got a small bit of caffeine in it. It makes one think of the savory recipes in Laura Esquivel's sensuous ""Like Water for Chocolate"",or the chili/chocolate blend Vianne gives to her French customers in ""Chocolat."" It's enchanting. It's hot chocolate disguised as a tea. Mayan Cocoa Spice is full of chocolate,spice,and everything nice!",1
"This is amazing stuff especially with Amazon Prime. PB2 + APO + Amazon Prime = almost like home. It taste better than real peanut butter and there are endless recipes to try!<br /><br />I use this in my shaker cup with Chocolate Shakeology, 3 tbsp of PB2 and 12oz of 1% milk. Get's me at least one healthy meal per day!",1
"For the first two years of my cats lives, they were getting Purina One, or the natural/organic stuff found at Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  My two girls were fine with it, but their brother became tubby.  I wasn't sure what to do, the cats were all getting enough exercise since they roughhouse with each other.  The one day my mom's cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  In an attempt to keep her cat healthy, she switched to another brand of ""Healthy"" cat food (very similar to Orijen).  I took home a sample of it for my own cats and they LOVED it.  Simply out of wanting to keep my cats from ever getting diabetes (most store brand pet foods have far too many carbs than necessary), I began my own research and came across Orijen,<br /><br />This food is amazing.  Yes, it is pricey, but because the content is less filler and more substance, they eat much less than needed, so it ends up breaking fairly even.  Their coats are healthier -- one of my girls was having a dandruff problem (something I didn't think Domestic Shorthair Tabbies could get) which cleared up after switching foods.  Their stool even became more compact because of, again, less filler.  Most importantly, my male cat suddenly began shedding the pounds with no other change other than his diet!  That made me quite happy.<br /><br />Even if you don't decide to try this dry food, research.  Make sure what you're giving your cats is actually GOOD for them and not just stamped with some fancy designer label like Science Diet.  My cats being happy makes ME happy.",1
"I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food. I hadn't really heard of supplements for pets but I did a little research and liked what I found. My dogs love to carrot supplements in their food! I have a smaller dog who is a picky eater and would refuse food sometime. After adding in the carrots to her food she went crazy and finished every bite. I am also feeding my dogs the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBWKU"">Olewo Dehydrated Red Beets Dog Food Supplement, 2.2-Pound</a>. If you are going to try the carrots, get to red beets too!",1
"Cereal. This stuff is fantastic on healthy cereal like Kashi and any cold oat-based product. I sprinkle a heaping spoonful (probably about a tablespoon) on every morning, along with pecans and blueberries (if they're in season). It adds a fruity and complex chocolate taste that doesn't overpower the fruit, nuts, and oats. Oh, and probably about 5 grams of fiber. On that note, maybe I should recommend that you work your way up to my super-cereal. 15 grams of fiber in one sitting might not be a good idea if that's how much you usually get in a day.",1
"these arrived very quickly & i was excited to see how the pups would like them.  i like that there are so many in the package.  i've always held in high regard anything rawhide & sweet potato so this was a no brainer....our pups love both!  these sticks are the best!  they incorporate chewing, gnawing, flavor & fun.  i definitely would buy these again.",1
"i love these seeds, they taste great and are packed with nutrition and fiber, a wonderful substitution to cookies and candy, i swapped out peanuts for these seeds and they are great",1
Only way I have found to take Calcium without nausea.  It has also helped me to sleep better at night. Tastes okay too... I will buy it again!,1
"arrived in record time and super condition.  I got two, one as a thank you gift, and now I wish I had a second for myself.  Like another reviewer, I'm not going for bonsai, so for now it's in what's euphamistically called a 5 gal pot (but it probably really 3) and will be transplanted to dirt later.  Thumbs up!",1
"These are the thin style pretzels that are truly ""thin"" which is what my family likes.  Many ""thin"" pretzels are very thick.  The best thing about these is they are organic and a  Newman's Own product, which makes me feel good about my kids eating them.  I send them in their lunches to school and they love them.  Healthy snack and good price on Amazon.",1
Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.,1
"See's, in my opinion, makes absolutely the best chocolate in the United States. I sure wish they would make it eligible for Amazon Prime. I'd get a subscription for 2lbs a month lol.",1

Everyone in my office raved about how good these cookies are. Calorie count is very reasonable and cookies are DELICIOUS!!,1
"The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.",1
"This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this ""review"" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for ""Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.""  The Amazon product image clearly said ""Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream"" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say ""Double Stuf"" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.",1
"I have been buying Farmer's Market organic butternut squash at my local supermarket for the past year. It wasn't always available when I shopped there so finding it on Amazon.com was a great find for me. This is probably the best butternut squash I have eaten, and it's well worth every penny......which by the way, comes out to far less 'pennies' at Amazon than at my local supermarket.",1
I use both types like it is going outta style!  I put it in my protein shakes and I use it as a 50 percent substitution in all my protein-related bars of regular peanut butter.  Being in powder formallows YOU to control the consistency.,1
This is a great bargain anyway you cut it. You get a pound of organic tea for a very fair price. The aroma is very strong and is very well welcomed. I brewed it in a keurig coffee maker and the taste is better then most teas. It is worth a try. I know that I will try more by this brand.,1
"Some may find this hard to get down, the taste and texture aren't the most pleasant, but by simply mixing it with some fruit or juice, you'll hardly notice it",1
"I know you're thinking no way, but actually this is really good. It is hard to find this soda on sale in grocery stores, so the price of this case is pretty competitive. The best part about this purchase was getting to try 2 cans of every flavor. Here are my favorites:<br /><br />Cola, Caffeine free Cola, Root Beer, Grape, Dr. Zevia, Mountain Zevia, Cream Soda, Lemon Lime Twist.<br /><br />Flavors I wasnt crazy about:<br /><br />Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Citrus, Orange.<br /><br />Having a husband to pawn those last four flavors off on is awesome! Stranded on a desert island, I would pick the Root Beer. It even makes a great chaser, although I prefer the Cola for chasers.",1
"This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  § homiedog §",1
"We exclusively drink iced tea all the time.  I make it from scratch with a Mr. Coffee iced tea maker and use the same amount of ingredients all the time.  I like to keep a good supply of these ingredients on hand in the event I can't get to the store.  Amazon is my way of doing this.  I can buy in bulk and have it delivered to my front door.  I am a diabetic and use Sugar Twin for my tea.  This is sometimes hard to find, but Amazon keeps me well supplied.  We love the taste of Lipton Tea and I don't use any other brand.  One thing I wish they would do:  make tagless tea bags so I won't have to do this before I make my tea.  Try Lipton, it's really good, hot or cold, and let Amazon supply it, as well as many other items!  If you buy enough, you won't have to pay for shipping either.",1
"My dog loves this food and so do I. Ever since I have been feeding her this, she has had the softest fur and overall better digestion. Ive tried her on a few different foods but this is the one that Ive stuck with.",1
"I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.  I guess Wolkgang wants a cut.  If you catch it on sale, buy it.",1
"Amid all the horror stories and bad experiences with this product that several other people have unfortunately had, I would like to write my own review. Vita Coco is my favorite brand of coconut water and I have been drinking it for a couple years now, and I recently decided to try ordering by the case here at Amazon instead of hunting down the odd carton or two at stores across my city (it's not that easy to find in San Antonio!) like I had been doing before. I was weary of giving Amazon a shot because of the other reviews with people's negative experiences, but luckily and thankfully I experienced none of those shipping and/or quality control issues with the water! My box of 6 1L Vita Coco's arrived promptly, was well packaged and the water itself was well within a reasonable expiration date (April 2013)! I couldn't be happier and look forward to getting my cases of VC shipped to me on a regular monthly basis with Subscribe & Save now! Hooray!",1
After years of searching for the food my dogs would like I finally found the kind of dry food I don't have to mix with real beef or chicken to make it tasted. They love it.,1
I use this instead of the yellow or blue stuff. It tastes better and doesn't make my brain fuzzy.,1
"Here's the plot of 1988's ""Beetlejuice"", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).",1
"This Snickers product is Awesome! You definitely forget that this is a nutritional protein bar. Not only does this product contain 20 grams of protein & taste great, but it is great to eat as a snack or when you are on the go. The only downfall is that the product sells out very quickly so I would suggest you buy 2-3 boxes at a time to be on the safe side.",1
"Being raised in Colombia I was exposed to the best coffee in the world. Once I moved to the United States, I could not find a coffee that would compared to the one I was used too. Then I saw a Yuban can in the supermarket 15 years ago, the first taste made me realize that this would be the best coffee I would find in the stores. Haven't bought anything else since.",1
"You know what ""normal"" yellow mustard tastes like. S&B hot mustard ain't that. This is a dry powder you mix with water and allow to sit a minute or two to develop the full flavor.<br />And by flavor I mean an all out assault on your nasal passages (especially if you try too much!). It's kinda like English mustard but even more intense. (I am sure this mustard will play a lead role in ""The Expendables 3"").<br />Anyway this mustard smells/tastes similar to the little packets of hot mustard you get at Chinese restaurants but with much more WAHOO!<br />If you haven't been scared off yet I recommend trying it. If you do find it is too hot you need to either go back to the temple and retrain OR you could try diluting it with ketchup, soy sauce, or even your own tears.<br />The little tin should last a long time since you don't need a whole lot (I would say following the instructions on the tin will make too much).<br />I hope you find this review useful!",1
"This is a delightful addition to my low<br />carb eating plan which includes steaks,<br />chicken, shrimp, and hamburger patties.<br />I have a bottle on my nightstand for a<br />quick nip during the night.....joke.<br />I love it, thanks.<br />Jim/Anaheim",1
Bought this as a gift for my mom because she loved mine. It arrived very quickly and was just what she wanted. Thanks!!,1
"These are the best rawhide chews for dogs with allergies. My westie is always chewing his feet and I've tried everything to ease his discomfort. It is especially bad when he chews on a treat because after he finishes, he can still smell the scent on his paws and continues to lick! It used to drive us crazy, until we tried these natural rawhide chews. My husband purchased these at a local drugstore when we got our new westie puppy and needed to give her something for teething. Needless to say our older male dog wanted to join in the fun! We gave him one and we were so relieved that when it was gone, he was done, no licking or chewing after the fact. I can't find them anywhere anymore except on Amazon. This is my second order of multiple packs. Whoops, I shouldn't have shared the secret, now all of you will buy them all up!",1
"I was very pleased with the product, and I have committed myself to a periodic shipment of this product on a yearly plan!",1
I love this product. No more measuring coffee in the morning.<br />No more throwing old coffee out. Best Ideal ever.,1
"Bought these to decorate cupcakes for a kid's Halloween party. They are very cute, look like the picture, as advertised!",1
"I have only used the tropical fruit, but I absolutely love this flavor! I just started using it in the last couple of weeks, so I cannot attest to the old recipe.  However, performance wise, I start drinking a 1/2 scoop per 12 oz of water (according to the company 1 scoop = approx. 3 TBL) a few hours before I'm going to exercise, and keep up the 1/2 scoop regiment probably every hour before I actually exercise. Usually I don't like to drink any fluids while I'm exercising as it upsets my stomach, but I do take a few sips of this drink during the ride, (for the ride, I do 1 1/2 scoops per 16 oz of water) and I feel it definitely helps my performance.  There were times prior to using Cytomax where I felt completely fatigued at the 13th mile of a 15 mile challenging bike ride. But after I started using this stuff, I felt fine at the 13th mile and even felt like I could another 7 miles.  I've had no stomach issues either.  I do 15 mile moderate and challenging bike rides approximately 5 times a week.",1
This product was offered at a great price and only took a few days for delivery. Will definitely make many repeat purchases. Thanks.,1
"I like just dropping the filter pack (or two or three)in my coffee pot, filling the water chamber... tasty coffee- no mess.",1
purchased this item through amazon. delivery was timely and well packaged. item was just as advertised. works well in all dishes that call for fish sauce. a 24 ounce bottle is a lot of fish sauce so we have plenty to use since it comes in a pack of two!,1
I have tasted a bunch of coffees. And this is one of the best flavored. I will continue to reorder the JFuel  and from this seller. Also. This seller is quick. My coffee was here in 3 days. USPS. And I ordered over a holiday weekend.,1
"If you are from England you know there is no substitute for UK made HP Sauce and you also know that the US made version just doesn't cut it. This is the real thing. Having found this I will no longer have to buy a years worth of HP Sauce before I head for Heathrow on each visit. Now to enjoy the real flavor with my baked beans, cheese on toast and many other delicacies from the British Isles.",1
"A great, quality product, sent speedy delivery! Product advertised was product delivered! Will buy from again, as I love this product! Please keep selling it! I will buy, and buy, again....!",1
"Thiscuit has long since been a leader in having a wide variety of crackers. This one, as well, is among their best. It can be used alone or with spread's, cheese among other topping's. I highly recommend this biscuit above most others.",1
"My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended.",1
I have been drinking this for breakfast for a number of years. I'm not a coffee drinker so this offers the compromise between coffee and hot chocolate.  I recently started mixing the sugar free and the regular to cut back on sugar.,1
This little babies have saved my fingers from many puncture wounds. They are easy to use and the kitties all think they are getting treats rather than medicine. They even begged for them.,1
"Tastes just as good as the older version with golden or yellow bag. So, not sure what the 'premium"" is, but it's still good if you like the Thai coffee taste.",1
"Amazing! And, best of all, there's NO SOY! Theo has a huge veriety of very unique flavors and none of them have soy.",1
"I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this peanut butter, because I happen to be a bit of a PB addict. I consume a lot of it. Planter's has entered this market with a bang, in my opinion. This is some of the best-tasting PB I have ever had. It has the peanut taste without the bitterness and without the sweetness that some other PBs include. It does not have an overwhelming aftertaste, which I think is a good thing. The texture is extra-creamy, which makes it very spreadable (and spoonable) and easily swallowed. You don't feel like you need to wash it down. This is yummy stuff!<br /><br />I did a label comparison with the PB I have been buying for years, which is a low-fat creamy style. Interestingly, Planters has fewer calories, fewer carbs, and more dietary fiber - more fat, of course, but not a huge amount.<br /><br />Guess what - I have a new peanut butter. Nice job, Planter's!",1
"I'm not kidding! This is the best tomato spaghetti sauce ever offered in jars on supermarket shelves, and the only one I'd use unless cooking for my in-laws. But it's not sold just everywhere; most of the big mall supermarket chains don't carry it. The price here for six 14-ounce jars is roughly what you'd pay in a market, but then there's the shipping cost. Mom's also makes a puttanesca that's oxymoronically respectable.<br /><br />What makes it better than average? It might be just that Mom's uses real olive oil in abbondanza, rather than tasteless soya oil. In this ""garlic & basil"" sauce, you'll see whole cloves of garlic and rough-chopped leaves of basil, and what's better, you'll taste both. Possibly the sauce-wallahs don't overcook the tomatoes. All I know for sure is that Mom's has more gusto italiano genuino than its competitori.",1
I discovered Dingo's about 5 months ago.  My 2 dogs love them.  I give them greenies which they devoured in less than a minute.  The minis take longer to chew and are a perfect treat.  I give them several times a week.,1
These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...,1
This mac and cheese is a fast snack for after school for a starving 9 year old!<br />It is fast and easy to use and she seems to like the taste just fine.<br />Make sure it is not too hot when you give it to them!,1
"I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers.  Now I'm using my k-machine nearly every day again and loving it.  The best part of these k-cups is they're not made entirely out of plastic like all the rest.  I do think that the ""all plastic"" k-cups affect the overall taste of the coffee.  The fog chasers have a ""filter paper"" bottom that contributes to a much more authentic brewed coffee taste.  Great deal and a great cup of coffee!!!",1
Never gave much thought to this treat until Marshawn Lynch came to town...Awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big Seahawks sticker on it...Now we have Matt Flynn beast-mode cajun style...,1
"Well balanced flavor.  My husband likes strong expresso type of coffe and I don't like too strong coffee so I had to buy two different kinds of flavor before, but now we can compromise each other with this.",1
These are a great snack and the whole family loves them. I keep some in my purse for the kids when they get hungry and they are make for a healthy yummy treat!!,1
"Absolutely delicious !!!  I like just a hint of flavor in my regular coffee, so , I mix the two.....about one third Gevalia, two thirds regular.  This makes for a great French Vanilla flavored coffee without overriding the coffee taste.",1
"I have ordered this a few times over the past couple years. It is always a crowd pleaser.  Everything is precooked - all you have to do is heat and eat.  The ribs are fantastic.  I have also gotten the BBQ combo - The ribs are very meaty and the smoke is perfect.  Considering shipping is included, these are nicely priced. I have sent Burgers ribs and combos to family members as gifts and all have raved about them.  I have not tried the hams, sausages, bacon etc just the BBQ sampler and the ribs so far.  I would definately buy again.",1
"I have tried many many different protein bars over the years, and this is by far the best tasting protein bar with all the right nutrition too. 20 grams of protein + 10 grams of Fiber (40% of your daily) along with all the great vitamins and minerals @ 100% daily, even a good amount of iron and calcium both @ 45% daily. You can't beat this bar. It is just a tad gritty, but all bars with this amount of protein are and much worse. I highly recommend this bar, I have been using it daily for nearly 2 years now. Look for them at Wal-Mart, you can buy a box of 6 for around $8.00",1
"I love the mango, whole nuts and coconut in these bars! They are perfect for a mid-day snack. My 10 year old granddaughter is always asking if she can take one for snack break at school.",1
"The thing I hate most about flavored coffee is that most of it ends up tasting like candy. The vanilla in this doesn't overpower the taste of the coffee. Vanilla meet Starbucks, Starbucks win! Good stuff, no after-taste - cream makes it smoother along with a little touch of sugar. Cafe International this is not.",1
"Love using this coconut oil as a replacement for butter on toast, pancakes, sweetpotatoes, in oatmeal, cream of wheat, and a lot of other foods. I keep extra tub in bathroom to use on skin. It's a great product that's also good for you.",1
"I have been using urbani truffle oil for years and it is the best product I have come across.  I have tried less expensive products with more oil, but they were not as fragrant or flavorful as Urbani.  Bottom line, you get what you pay for.  I wish I could find a local supplier because a don't like paying the shipping.",1
"Black garlic Is simply the best. I use it for everything. I have let other people try it, and they love it.",1
"I love this curry. The only place I could find it was in a town 50 miles from my house. Buying it online was my only option. Although it is cheaper to buy it directly at the store, I was happy I was able to have it shipped directly to my home. VERY happy:)",1
"I always keep a jar of manuka around the house, especially during the winter months. If I even feel the slightest hint of a sore throat, I take a few spoonfuls of the honey and it goes right to work. It's great for general health too, but it really rocks for sore throats. If you have strep throat, I highly recommend trying manuka honey! I really like the Watson and Son stuff, both for the flavor and color. Definitely one of the highest quality honeys available...",1
"The smell of this tea is what first draws you in and then when you try it, you won't want anything else. I walked into a co-workers office and asked what he was drinking as the smell was heavenly.  He gave me a teabag and I have since been completely hooked.  And, so have other co-workers.  Love it.....",1
How can you go wrong? This is 70 calories a bag and simply delicious. It's just a small snack. There's only two handfuls of popcorn in there but it's yummy.,1
I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.,1
"This is one of the best cereals I have ever tried. It tastes great, it has a great crunch, it smells divine. The only thing is that is loaded with sugar and I would not eat it every day.<br /> I also heard complaints that's a bit pricey. I get it at the local Target store for 3.19 (13oz box), but I think it's worth every penny.",1
Great product.  I was borderline anemic and this product really helped me to improve my well-being and get my #s back in the healthy range.,1
I love to snack and pop chips have allowed me to still get my crunch on at only 100 calories a bag. I've lost 35 pounds making small changes and counting calories and this is one one them.,1
"Excellent product, great value with free shipping! I have been purchasing these on a regular basis for two or three years and the result has been consistently positive. I save $12 - $15 off retail prices in my area and the quality is much better than ""the cheapest"" alternative.",1
"I have been very happy with the Grove Square K-Cup products.  I really like the creamy Cappuccino French Vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla is great when you want a coffee that's creamy with a light flavor.  Great Price, cost less then other K-Cups which is also a great selling point!  I also like Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, and think the Grove Square Medium Roast is okay (it is an instant coffee, so it's lighter in flavor but still good).",1
Having tried various breads on the market this is by far the best tasting bread of all.<br />Closest to the 'real' thing as it gets.,1
"This oil smells like fresh coconut, which is what a good-quality coconut oil should smell like. It had a few pieces of real coconut floating at the bottom, which actually made it feel much more ""authentic"" to me. Interestingly enough, it arrived in liquid form (it's hot here) and I slathered it on my elbows right away. It worked great! Softened and smoothed them and got rid of that leathery feel. Can't wait to use it as a full-body moisturizer after a shower (just not on the face--never put coconut oil on the face if you don't like clogged pores).",1
"Okay I have to admit it I am hooked on these almonds. The cocoa flavor is subtle, and delicious. The packaging is clever, and easy on the hands. The fact that almonds are also beneficial and good for you doesn't hurt either. The unique lid allows me to keep up with portion control which is a good thing, otherwise I would probably empty the can. These Cocoa Roasted Almonds are like eating an almond candy bar without the guilt.<br />Highly recommended.",1
love me some Newtons and I can eat these in bunches and never stop. they are so good. i have dug them from way back in the day and they are a must for me everytime.,1
My 12 month old son LOVES this!  I tasted it and also think it's quite tasty!  Consistantcy isn't chunky more so just a thick puree.,1
"When we had moved into our house there were spiders everywhere in the garage and basement. I tried all kinds of sprays, those didn't work. Then I came across this and honestly didn't think it would work, but I was willing to try anything. Put them out and sure enough, WE CAUGHT EVERYTHING IN THEM! I'd say buy these before spray.",1
"My sister's youngest son had a pacifier which was nicknamed ""Pluggy"", which would keep him content for long stretches of time - and this is the doggy equivalent.<br /><br />I have a 17 pound Bedlington Terrier, for whom I purchased a Medium sized Everlasting Treat Ball, and we _both_ love it.  The ""everlasting"" treats that come with the ball were okay, but when they were in the ball she would lose interest because they were just too difficult to make any headway on, and when they were outside the ball she'd just chew them up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The real fun is putting small treats inside it (I use Charlee Bear brand turkey liver and cranberry treats which are about the size of a lima bean) and watching her go.<br /><br />There are several ways to get at them, she's discovered - rolling by poking it with her nose will sometimes yield results - smacking it with her paw is also sometimes lucky - and squeezing it with her jaws, which she can _barely_ do.  I think this is the secret - if she had a small she would be _too_ successful, and that would take the challenge out of it.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year, and it has sustained pretty much no damage, although shoes, electronics, socks and other items around our house had been completely destroyed before its arrival.  She can carry it sideways by biting on the flat part - the only problem is that we spend a lot of time looking for it when it gets hidden under things.  She knows the phrase Treat Ball by heart - and will usually go find it when asked - in order to get a refill - except when it has gotten into somewhere she is afraid or unable to go.  I'm buying another one so hopefully we can cut our hunting time in half.<br /><br />TREAT BALL RULES!",1
"I use all sorts of K-Cups, but this breakfast blend is definately my Go-To blend!! It is perfect - not too light, not too dark. I highly recommend this, as the price for the 50-count box is pretty good!!",1
My medium-sized mixed breed loved this bone.  I would recommend this--and maybe two cause they don't last long (at least at my house!),1
"We have cooked these lentils in the crockpot, added a little Texas Pete, chopped onions & dried red sweet peppers. Allow to cook several hours in crockpot, & check tenderness of lentils.  Added smokey salt for flavor or optional: smoked turkey leg or county ham hock.  Add some cooked brown rice before taking up & serve.  Great complete meal!",1
"This is my first Manuka honey and I must say that it tastes very nice.<br /><br />Toast a slice of bread (e.g., Arnold's Ancient Grains)<br />Spread honey<br />Spread peanut butter<br /><br />Enjoy!",1
This stuff is just beaming with vanilla flavor. It is LEAGUES ahead of anything you'd get at the grocery store!,1
It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.,1
We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?,1
"My Boston Terrier Max loves the Plato Organic Chicken treats, his favorite actually. When I first gave him one of the Sweet Potato treats he wasn't sure what to think. He was thrown off by the texture I think and was having trouble chewing it. After he finally ate the first one he was sniffing around the garbage where we had put one he had left on the floor. He was trying to get the treat that was in there. Now everytime we break them out that's all he wants. Along with the Organic Chicken treats. He's hooked.",1
"When my dogs hear me opening the bag, they come running.  They absolutely love the liver treats and as an owner, I feel good about giving them a treat with no artificial ingredients or additives.  Buying the large bag through Amazon saves me $10 over buying 4 smaller bags locally.",1
"I buy these by the case - they're great alone, with peanut butter, with cheese, with hummus ...",1
"I wasn't sure about this product, but thought I'd give it a try.  I have course, thick hair and have difficulty with dandruff.  It does leave your hair a touch greasy, so I use it at night to nourish so I can wash it out in the morning and have no dandruff flakes.  This product is a balm, so it's thick and comes out similar to sculpting gel (although it does not style!).  It smells like fresh coconut, reminds me of a day at the beach, very nice! It goes on smooth and really soothes.  In addition to helping with dandruff, I got a sunburn on my part and used this and it prevented my scalp from being dry and grossly peeling! Overall, this is an AWESOME product and I will be using it regularly.",1
"Anything that is portable and easy is a great thing for a parent.  My son will happily eat these pouches over 'real' food even though he is way past the age of needing pureed food.  These come in real handy when you don't want to give a messy snack that is unhealthy as well.<br />The only downside, TSA is VERY inconsistent with the baby food allowance.  Sometimes we have been allowed through with these with no problems.  Other days (more often than not) we have either had to have each opened and tested or agree to the full body search (no thanks with a wily toddler).",1
"My dog loves this food and I don't have to worry about what's in it. With all of the bad dog food on the market, I'm glad there is a product like this one.",1
"Another delicious selection from the Pepperidge Farm Cookie Line-Up called Chesapeake Dark Chocolate Pecan. You get 8 large cookies per bag with 4 bags in an order. I purchased mine through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for $8.73 per order *I got 2* 'cause it was such a good price! These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!",1
"First of all, they are dry, but why is that a problem?<br />If anything, it is better! More concentrated nutrition and flavor. So instead of 10lb, u probably get 10.5lbs if u add some water...<br /><br />that is a trick btw. You can spray water on them and leave them for a few hours. I take a few, spray them and put them in a small jar. That way they are ready for munching later...",1
This brand and kind is the best for senior cats. It keeps the food down and rarely any vomits. It is also healthy for the cats.,1
"I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />""Feullitees Doree,"" which can be bought on in France.",1
"I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long.",1
"This is the only sugar that I use for cooking because it's the only granulated sugar that I've seen that actually contains vitamin and mineral nutrients. I've used it to make sweet Amish bread, crumb crust pies, cinnamon rolls, soft pretzels, smoothies, chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookies, brownies--any recipe that requires sugar. If you're looking for a sweetener that's unrefined and nutritious, this is it. The only sweetener that I've found to be more nutritious is molasses. Skip the other ""organic"" sugars if you're looking for something to add nutritional density to your diet.",1
"I have tried the mustard and tomato, even ones in dill sauce, but these are BY far the best. Can't beat smoked fish! Smoked fish is usually expensive when you by it at the store fresh and you have to eat it right away, but these are great because you can have them whenever and it's a perfect portion, and cheap, with no bones to pick out! I love these with cheese and beer.",1
these are a favorite of my dogs. My sister got them for free from a store she works at. the dogs pawed at her pocket as she walked in the door with them.,1
"These pickles beat any other on the market - best maid, klassic, they all pale in comparison to Frances Cowley. Each bite contains a mouthful of flavor. These pickles are great by themselves and also in any recipe containing pickles or relish. I made potato salad with them and it was so different than your regular run of the mill recipe. I highly recommend these pickles, and the spicy ones as well!!",1
"I've had other Izze flavors before, and have always been impressed. The pear was (and is) a favorite. But, apple, though seemingly more mundane, is every bit as good. If you don't know Izze's, these are very gently sparkling beverages that are light and refreshing.  The 8.4 oz cans are just enough to quench a thirst, or give you a sweet fix without too many calories. Can't recommend them enough.",1
"Rich, velvety, smooth and figgy...  What more can you want with goat or sheeps milk cheese...  Expensive (small size jar) but sooo worth it!",1
"This tea is great tasting, strong, and one bag makes two cups of tea. I've bought tea from around the world and think this is the best.",1
These bars are so good! I loved them warmed up! I definitely think these are a great snack or breakfast! I received this product for free from influenster!,1
"Love this product.  Read in ""Nourishing Traditions"" how the lobbiest for the domestic vegetable industry try to give Coconut Oil a bad rap.  It's excellent for cooking and is great for you.  It is safe and healthy.  I recommend it highly.  Excellent taste.",1
"I don't sprout these or anything, just use about a tablespoon when feeling nauseated from taking my multi-vitamin on an empty stomach. Works wonders, also a testosterone booster, and omega3 rich.",1
"I was very excited to try this drink, and  it did not disappoint. I wanted something refreshing for my mornings and this was perfect blend of espresso, coconut water, and milk. Although you only get 12 per package, its worth the little extra splurge. AMAZING & DELICIOUS",1
"I have bought a box these protein bars several times.  They make a great midday snack, or to take with you on a hike.  Excellent taste.  I was very happy to see them available once again on Amazon.",1
"Biltmore Italian Herb Vinaigrette Salad Dressing is the best our family has ever tried.  The taste & depth of flavors are unparalleled ~ and its ability to coat the salad mixture is excellent.  My husband's chosen dinner is chopped romaine, finely sliced low-salt deli turkey, parmesan and the Biltmore vinaigrette.<br />Our local market's distributer stopped carrying Biltmore.. a shame.. and couldn't find it anywhere.  Amazon came through.<br />My husband takes it with him when visiting his sister in California ~ she now orders it as well.  This is my first review, and such a worthy product.  Enjoy.",1
"I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!",1
"I bought the 1 lb. bag for something like a trial-pack, and I regret not buying more! This was the first time I had ever used oat bran, so I was not quite sure what to do with it, but I have found that it works EXTREMELY well when mixed with old-fashioned oats (for my typical breakfast of pumpkin maple oatmeal =]) The oat bran is finely ground, but it does a great job thickening up oats and giving it more texture as well as a little additional fiber. I highly recommend this product, and I look forward to purchasing more from Barry Farm",1
"Rooibos tea is so good for me,  with 50% more antioxidants than green.  My husband and I went to Seattle and stumbled upon this tea store.  It's now the only place I buy my tea--Amazon is the only way you can buy it.  I also buy their cinnamon and spice tea-- it the best!  It's quite different from other teas you have in the store.  They are bold an flavorful. They add natural flavored oils to the leaves before they are dried.",1
"I got one of those $25 gift certificate in the mail, and couldn't decide what to blow it on.  This was great.  I had, like, one Slim Jim a day for almost an entire month.  And they were the Tabasco flavored ones -- my favorite.<br /><br />If you've had a Tabasco Slim Jim before, well, you know what you're getting.  It's pretty clear.  If you haven't, well, maybe you should try one before you think about ordering two dozen.",1
"I grew up in a Southern family where my Mother would use 1 cup of sugar per pitcher of iced tea. I have always loved iced tea and have missed it since I had to give up sugar a year ago (let's face it, unsweetened tea with sweetener is NOT the same). So, I was excited to try the Sweet Tea MIO.<br /><br />I love that you can add as little or as much of the MIO as you want to your water. There is no predetermined size and you do not have to shake the water to get it to mix in. You just squirt, swirl, taste and add more if needed.<br /><br />I personally love the taste of MIO Sweet Tea. It is definitely the closest I have came to my Mother's sweet tea without all the sugar. It may be too sweet for some people though. My Husband who's Mother was more health conscience, thinks it is too sweet. The nice thing is that he can just add a tiny bit to a larger glass of water and be able to drink it.<br /><br />I definitely think that MIO is worth the price. It seem like a small bottle at first glance, but it lasts a long time. Southern Sweet Tea drinkers should love it.",1
This is a healthy treat from Italy that comes with benefits:  They taste great and they are high in B vitamins and Vitamin C.  For a little boost or a little treat these just can't be beat.<br /><br />Try them and you'll be hooked.,1
I like all of Bob's Red Mill products and this flaxseed is just great. I put 2 tablespoons into my smoothie in the morning and regularity is a given. It is also good to lower cholesterol. Sprinkle it on cereal is another good way to get this into your system.,1
"I live in Jacksonville and its hard to not notice the Iguana brand down here, and thats<br />a blessing. We can even get it at Publix and Winn Dixie and that is a major plus for<br />pepperheads down here. Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.<br /><br />Still not going to blow your head off, but it will make you nod your head with an<br />enthusiastic ""YES!"" when you try it. And but you'll have a hard time finding any other<br />real habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken. And I have to believe<br />this stuff is either contracted to Melinda's or by their producer since they both come<br />from Costa Rica, both have the same ingredients, and look almost identical. Duh!<br /><br />A great complement to veggies and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for<br />a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect.<br />Great stuff, a staple for any decent collection and worth seeking out. 5 Scovies",1
"I ordered this as a gift for my sister.  We had seen this plant on a recent visit to a botanical garden and she was fascinated by it.  I ordered it last weekend and the plant arrived within a few days.  It is bigger than expected and even had a couple ""babies"" attached.  The plant is now proudly displayed at my sister's house.  Great experience!  Would purchase from this vendor again.",1
"My order was received promptly and the candy was very fresh and sweet.  The quantity was right on time, enough to share and have on hand,",1
I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you,1
"I cook a lot with paprika and I've found a great variance in quality over the years. Cheaper ones are more bland and have no heat, almost as though they are cut with some other spice. With better quality paprika, however, you can actually use less and get greater flavor and heat.<br /><br />And this was clearly good paprika in spite of my taking the risk of buying  it on the Internet. I bought it for the price but was surprised at the quality.<br /><br />if you like some heat in your food, paprika is the perfect spice to make it happen.  if you like smoky flavors such as chipotle or smoked salt, smoked paprika is even better. It adds an earthiness with the heat and the flavor to compliment the Southwest flavors I love.<br /><br />The flavors come through, it truly has a smoky flavor profile, and it has just the right touch of heat.<br /><br />Does everyone need 80 oz?  maybe not. but we use it enough that it's actually far cheaper for us to buy it this way. As a Mexican food lover, I make room in the pantry!",1
"I really love this salt.  Not a strong taste and it doesn't overwhelm foods.  Just adds a nice, clean flavor.  Also a beautiful color.  Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is ""dense"" rather than ""crumbly"" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?",1
"Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.",1
My daughter is 2 months old and began using this product when she was 5 weeks old. I had a hard time producing enough milk for her. I would only pump about 1-1/2 oz per session; now I am pumping an average of 2-3 oz.,1
"I love this stuff I have had all kinds of maple syrup from home made amish to store brand, this is the best I have found excellent!!",1
WE LOVE THE GRABER OLIVES. THEY ARE SO BUTTERY AND TASTY.<br />WELL WORTH THE WAY TOO HIGH PRICE. YUM YUM YUM,1
"These kippers have a wonderful flavor and texture.  They are smokey with just enough salt.  I wish the cans were bigger.  You open the can and the fillets are solid and firm, which is surprising for not being in oil.  I think they taste a touch better than the John West brand without the oil.  If I had both in front of me I would have a problem picking between the two.  If you like smoked kippers this is the brand I would suggest.  I was a lifelong King Oscar fan until I tried these.",1
"Since finding Brazil Nuts in stores has become such a problem, I decided to order on line. These NOW Foods Brazil Nuts arrived fast and are very fresh. Planning to order more next week we have enjoyed them so much.",1
"I like this blend and the fact that it is organic and fair trade, but I want to make mention that this is not decaf coffee.  My husband drinks decaf and it is getting harder to find good decaf at the big box stores so I hopped on Amazon and searched on 'decaf kcup organic' and this item comes up.  As I was loading up our carousel I noticed how the label looks exactly like the ones on ""my"" level of the carousel (caffeinated)...yep, it is indeed NOT decaf.  And I certainly get it a lot cheaper at my local warehouse place. Lesson learned to read the description forward and back several times before adding to my cart.  Hopefully this review will save someone else from this mistake. I'm also going to try to report the discrepancy to Amazon if I can figure out the proper channel for doing so.",1
"I have giving each member of my family a box , I'm sure they will love Barry's tea as much as I do .",1
"I have always enjoyed M & M, but when mint dark chocolate M&M came along it has become my favorite. It has just the right amount of mint and tasty dark chocolate. A must try. You will not be disappointed and you will want more than one package.",1
"I HIGHLY recommend Fruitables--she absolutely LOVES them, and there's no junk or fillers in them. Made in USA, calories are reasonable, good all-purpose size, and they smell like ""people"" cookies--much nicer to have sitting in the kitchen than, say, liver-flavored snacks.",1
"It is so convenient receiving these single serve Pop Chips through the mail.  They stay fresh, and there is no waste or overdoing it.  One little bag is a decent portion of these tasty chips, and I've never seen this size in a store.",1
Great products and a great price.  I wish all foods would go back to simple ingredients.  They taste sooo much better.,1
Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.,1
"Very good, easy to work with, many uses, very good dry on icecream, just sprinkle on top.<br /><br />The only drawback to this product is the cost.  This also covers the plain PB powder.",1
"We bought this to make baby food with fruits and veggies we get at the farmer's market.  It is so easy to use, and clean up is fast.  The nice thing is that we can continue using it as a steamer later on as well - much easier to clean than large pots and pans we usually use to steam veggies.",1
"Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six...",1
"Unable to find lemon oil locally, I ordered online to save time. The product was delivered within the week, was packaged well and was as described on the website. I could not be happier. Thank you!",1
"These were soft-yet-chewy and so flavourful! I'll never go back to the Brach's gummy peaches. These arrived quickly and were very, very fresh. I put the opened bag inside a large freezer bag to help maintain the freshness; it's worked for the 5lb of (still soft!) gummy bears we bought at Christmas.",1
Can never be enough chocolate for me and this coffee is quite satisfying to my need for coffee and chocolate!,1
"This mustard is unbelievably good.  I'm delighted that I can get it online, since our P&C stores were bought out by Tops and we can't get it in the local stores anymore. It's not too sweet, not too spicy, not too runny....just wonderful.  I eat it with cheese and crackers, as a pretzel dip, and on ham or turkey sandwiches.  You can't go wrong!",1
"I have dry mouth issues. I use Halls Refresh Drops for relief from my dry mouth when it is really bothering me. Tropical Wave is my favorite flavor, but for some reason, I can no longer find this flavor in the stores. So, I went to Amazon and found it. Yeah! The stores have strawberry, and lemon, which are o.k.",1
"These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.  They are packed with good stuff that help keep your blood sugar balanced (I am hypoglycemic with fibromyalgia and a few other mechanical issues) and your energy stays up there.  This may have me making it a major part of my daily regime. These bars keep actually full me up for a while too.  They come in a smaller size which I am going to get just to stick in my purse for those sugar drops that leave you shaking and dizzy!! and of course for fighting those hunger pangs between meals.",1
"I am so grateful for this chew.  My medium sized pit has gone through everything in minutes and he gets crazy OCD about chewing.  He tore the green nubs off in minutes and thought for sure this thing was dead meat, but after that he settled into going after the ends of the bone.  I am concerned with how sharp it gets but I keep checking it for blood and don't see any.. yet.  He's probably had an hour a day with it for a week and it's not much worse for wear.",1
"Lavazza is the best espresso coffee, I tried several manufacturers, in my opinion the Lavazza Blue Crema is the best of the best.",1
"I recently discovered I have candida and have been forbidden to drink anything with caffeine, sugar, or gluten, which cause a flare-up in my symptoms.  My boyfriend and I went to a food co-op on Saturday to find things that I CAN eat (very few traditional grocery store foods are allowed on the candida diet).  I noticed Zevia and was pleased to find that it's sweetened with Stevia, one of the few sweeteners I can consume.  The price was a little high (at a little over a dollar a can, plus tax), but I felt it was worth it to get my sweet fix.<br /><br />I was tentative to try this because we had recently purchased Truvia, and the taste right out of the jar was slightly bitter.  But with my first sip of the ginger root beer, I loved it!  It's very bubbly and light and refreshing; not bitter at all.  It doesn't weigh you down or coat your teeth with a sugar film like normal sodas, either.  And the ginger root beer taste is different than any other soda, too.  All that said, Zevia's Ginger Root Beer makes a perfect substitute to regular root beer.  If I could eat ice cream or have alcohol, I bet it'd be wonderful in a root beer float or mixed with blackberry brandy (my favorite!)<br /><br />I highly recommend at least giving this soda a try.  I haven't tried any other varieties yet, but I can personally attest to the wonderful flavor of the ginger root beer, and anyone who's looking for a healthy soda option should consider Zevia.",1
"I love this tea!!  To perfect my mornings, after brewing this tea, I add Madhava Light Agave Nectar and a little Silk Vanilla Creamer--Wow.  It even satisfies my sweet tooth.",1
"Oh my gosh!  I thought Bosco had disappeared from the planet!  This was my absolute favorite chocolate topping as a kid.  I have bought Hershey for years because I didn't know Bosco was even around any more.  I am a chocolate lover, and I do love Hershey, Nestle, and Cadbury chocolate, but Bosco is the BEST for topping ice cream!  I just ordered a bunch.",1
"Zevia makes the best all natural diet soda that I have ever tasted. You taste the flavor more than the sweetener. I have been using stevia in my drinks previously so the stevia taste didn't bother me. If you are not used to stevia you will find this a little hard to get used to. Stevia has an aftertaste that takes a little getting used to, but I'm so adjusted to the taste that I don't notice a difference.<br /><br />The ginger ale drink tastes like ginger ale. It's really great for when I have an upset stomach and I can't get enough of it. These drinks are great for diabetics as well because stevia can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />I am so happy to be able to drink ginger ale again. I have this on auto-ship since the price is excellent.",1
"I give these to my toddler, call them Applesauce, and he loves them still.  They are the perfect on-the-go snack, they take no prep, don't need to be refrigerated, and even have vegetables.  I'll use this over a bag of chips any day of the week.",1
"My daughter is gluten intolerant and we have tried many GF pastas.  This is by far the best!!  When reheated, as in a casserole, the texture is just like fresh.  I will continue to use this pasta exclusively.",1
"This is the best peanut butter I have ever tasted.  It is not easy to say that since I bought it because it was the most economical.  My wife says this is much better for me since it is reduced fat and zero trans fat.  That is a concern for me, but not nearly as much as the wonderful ""peanutty"" taste.",1
Love the pod design. Going to try the French Roast next.<br />I am a coffe snob and I admit it! This is great coffee!,1
Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores. She likes these and the shortbread cookies. They have a nice flavor for sugar-free and I recommend them to anyone on a low sugar diet.,1
"Got a nice tang, As far as blue cheese flaver, its so mild that people that hate blue cheese will still eat these and like em as long as they dont know. >=)",1
A christmas pudding that is just the right size for one. Good flavor and keeps well.,1
"I was a little worried my cat might not like this food after reading some of the reviews. I bought the Turkey and Salmon Formula and this is the best purchase I have made for my cat so far. He really enjoys the food and finishes it almost instantly after I give it to him. I guess you have to decide to buy this stuff on a cat by cat basis, but I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
I have given up caffiene and other sugar drinks and was looking for an alternative. The rooibos red tea is great. It tastes good without sweetener or I add a little stevia for a treat.The peach flavor much more mild than other peach tea.,1
I bought four different colors for my four granddaughters--they loved them!  My children had similar in their baskets when they were small and I was thrilled to find them!,1
"This is a great product to help with insomnia.  Really great.  Some do not like the smell or taste, but I actually love it.  Maybe it is an acquired test.  A+++ for this product, it is excellent.",1
"I finally found a delectable little pretzel!  Not too big, not too salty, not too dry, never a burnt taste, just right for MY tasty taste buds! You ought to try Newman's Own Organics Spelt Pretzzels! Nell Newman really came up a winner with these! Snacking or dipping...they are GREAT! jpg/UT",1
Went to ever store in town to get a refill before my last cup ran out but no luck. I was making latte's with this can I had found on the shelf and we were hooked. Thank God for amazon in a snap we had 6 cans on the shelf and each cup is as good as the last.,1
I also buy the beef feast that way we can mix things up a little because a Happy Cat makes a happy mommy!,1
"Very happy with the product.... in a taste test, for the price, it ranks very high.  Delivery was prompt and as expected.",1
"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing.",1
"For a powdered chicken bouillon, this product comes the closest to home-made.  It is a lot more convenient than spending hours over a stock pot.<br />We have tried many similar products and this one is the best of the lot.  We use it as a salt replacement in many recipes where it gives a background of rich flavor.<br />We order it by the case we use it so much.",1
These are the best Gluten Free Cookies I have had in 2 yrs. Crunchy & full of flavor.,1
"A friend of mine gave me several of these Grove Square Cappuccino French Vanilla k cups!! Just loved them, but could not find them available in any local store. She told me she got them from Amazon.com. We fix it with a little bit of cream whip on top! Tastes just like you bought it from a coffee shop. Have ordered more, so I never run out. You will not be sorry if your purchase this item. I did order and try the Hazelnut, liked it but not as much as this.",1
"The salt is more moist than I thought it would be, but enhances taste and a little sprinkling is all it takes.",1
The anise oil was nowhere to be found in Modesto.  I could not believe the inexpensive cost...even w/ s&h.  The cookies were the best!  They tasted better than the expensive ones we wait for and buy at Christmas...and I made them in April!  The product arrived in perfect condition and much sooner than I'd anticipated.,1
"After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.",1
"NO JOKE...The best brownies of my life, gluten or no gluten! Kid tested Mother approved.",1
"This stuff is absolutely wonderful. While it's great delivered on a chip, my black bean soup wouldn't be the same without it.  A cup to a cup and a half in a fairly large batch of pinto or black bean soup is what I typically use. Yum!",1
These are super high quality wafers. I have had many kinds and this brand is the best I have ever had.,1
