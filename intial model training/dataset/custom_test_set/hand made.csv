"Privileged from birth, it was during the Vietnam War period, Trump discovered he could avoid difficult times and hard work. His cocoon of wealth lacked checks and balances and enabled Donald Trump to believe himself both smarter and better looking than anyone else. At first making pronouncements based upon excellent education, and then as school grew more distant and Trump more coddled, Donald Trump realized that, almost universally, his pronouncements on any subject was met with instant approval and praise. Donald J. Trump was always right. Ask his friends.",-1
"Donald Trump’s presidency has been every bit as amateurish and chaotic and ridiculous as his campaign was. As time has elapsed many of those who were terrified at first have come to view the president as a clown who is in way over his head. Utter uncertainty prevailed during the months between Trump’s election in November and his January inauguration, and many were genuinely concerned that Trump would quickly become a tyrant once in office, using the power of the presidency to go after his enemies and silence his critics.",-1
"Billionaire businessman Bill Gates just made good on his reputation as a one of the most generous philanthropists. Gates, the world’s richest man, donated $4.6 billion worth of shares in Microsoft Corp in June — making this his largest donation in 17 years. Gates donated 64 million shares earlier this summer, according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing released Monday and first shared by Bloomberg.",1
"The Beatles are four British ISIS members accused of torture, mock execution and decapitation of foreign hostages, including three Americans — journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

"“This is truly a magic bullet for our patients with TRK-positive cancer,” said Leo Mascarenhas M.D, M.S, deputy director of the Children’s Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases and director of the Names Family Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Program in oncology at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, who helped design the pediatric part of the study. “In some cases, this cancer can be treated surgically – often requiring amputation or another disfiguring surgical procedure. After treating our patient with infantile fibrosarcoma with larotrectinib, the cancer shrunk sufficiently and we were able to surgically remove the tumor while preserving the patient’s leg.”",1
MPs are about to vote to put the tertiary education bill into law with the changes that we all told them to make. This is fantastic news! We knew communities would lose out if future governments could freely move public funds into profit-driven tertiary institutions - and we stopped it happening. This is really significant. We spoke out and together we have changed the future of public tertiary education.,1
"Actors and athletes increasingly using their forums for political activism are turning off viewers, according to a newly released poll. A McLaughlin & Associates/Media Research Center survey released Wednesday found that 44 percent were less likely to watch sports and entertainment shows “because they have become too political.” In addition, 75 percent said they watch sports and entertainment to escape from politics, and “do not want to be bombarded with partisan political messages.” The poll of 1,000 likely voters comes with television ratings plummeting in the last year for high-profile sports and entertainment events. The NFL regular season ratings dropped by 9.7 percent in 2017 amid player protests during the national anthem, while the 2018 Academy Awards show suffered its worst-ever audience ratings, falling by 19 percent from 2017.",-1
"Hillary Clinton has not had a good week. In the aftermath of her trip to India and awful comments about Americans and women in particular, most of her allies and Democrats in general were explicit that it was time for her to leave the political arena. The shorter message from Democrats to Mrs. Clinton was “shut up and go away.” But she has not. Instead, she took to Facebook and doubled-down on her smear of Americans who didn’t vote for her as racist and mindless.",-1
"What are the media and political elite smoking these days? They actually appear to believe that Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s Eton-educated chief executive, who has been suspended, is a Bond-type villain behind the scenes, whose data company has the power to change the world. They also appear to believe the self-serving claims made by the pink-haired data science geek and whistleblower at the heart of the exposé, Christopher Wylie, that he became ‘Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool’, which brought Trump to power. This is deeply delusional.",-1
"Afua Hirsch, quite unintentionally, has provided us with a searing insight into the 21st-century politics of identity. Her narcissistic study of her personal identity – Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging – is intended to be a memoir-cum-treatise on what it’s like to be black and of African origin in Britain in the early part of the millennium. But it works far better as a glimpse, an often terrifying glimpse, into the myopia and backwardness and insatiable appetite for victim status that motors the identitarianism that is now the dominant ideology of the bourgeoisie. This book documenting a well-educated woman’s descent into the self-obsessive and self-victimising cult of identitarian thinking should serve as a warning to everyone to reject this politics.",-1
"Jordan Peterson appears very profound and has convinced many people to take him seriously. Yet he has almost nothing of value to say. This should be obvious to anyone who has spent even a few moments critically examining his writings and speeches, which are comically befuddled, pompous, and ignorant. They are half nonsense, half banality. In a reasonable world, Peterson would be seen as the kind of tedious crackpot that one hopes not to get seated next to on a train.",-1
"This much should be obvious from even a cursory reading of him: If Jordan Peterson is the most influential intellectual in the Western world, the Western world has lost its damn mind. And since Jordan Peterson does indeed have a good claim to being the most influential intellectual in the Western world, we need to think seriously about what has gone wrong. What have we done to end up with this man? His success is our failure, and while it’s easy to scoff at him, it’s more important to inquire into how we got to this point. He is a symptom. He shows a culture bereft of ideas, a politics without inspiration or principle. Jordan Peterson may not be the intellectual we want. But he is probably the intellectual we deserve.",-1
President Obama made history as the first minority to be elected president. Even many who opposed his election felt proud of our country as he took the oath of office. We are honored today to have the man currently holding the office and aspiring for another term.,1
"Obama recalled the late Senator Ted Kennedy telling him about the times when he would stroll the halls of the cancer ward when his son Teddy, Jr. was being treated more than forty years ago. While the elder Kennedy did not worry about paying for his son’s treatment, this was not the case for so many other parents of children in the cancer ward. Parents did not complain; they simply did their best for their children. Courage requires endurance. And their courage inspired Ted Kennedy to devote his energies toward providing affordable health care.",1
"Nuclear energy has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future. Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous, and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean. Renewable energy is better for the environment, the economy, and doesn’t come with the risk of a nuclear meltdown.",-1
"The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) urges doctors to prescribe non-GMO diets for all patients. They cite animal studies showing organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility. Human studies show how genetically modified (GM) food can leave material behind inside us, possibly causing long-term problems. Genes inserted into GM soy, for example, can transfer into the DNA of bacteria living inside us, and that the toxic insecticide produced by GM corn was found in the blood of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses.",-1
Communism kills! This is not debatable. The record is crystal clear. The U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee conducted investigations into the number killed in the Soviet Union and China. Their report stated that 35 million to 45 million had been killed in the Soviet Union and 34 million to 62.5 million in Communist China.,-1

"Gareth Bale appeared in the press room at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium. After the screening of a video with his best moments as a Real Madrid player, the Welsh striker welcomed the extension of his contract until 30 June 2022: ""I am very very happy, delighted. When I arrived I wanted to be successful and win titles. It's another dream come true and I hope there are more titles and trophies. I have improved my Spanish, my family is more integrated and I feel that the fans love me""",1
"By that, I mean a working assumption that the solution to the crises of climate change and rising demand for energy (and the consequent upward spiral in energy prices) can be found, relatively quickly, in technological innovation. Regarding energy, that means taking the affirmative steps to maximize the immense energy sources that we know are available right now. Regarding climate, that means exploring and endorsing the various geo-engineering solutions to climate change.",1
"Nothing else can produce the joy or broken heart that motherhood allows. I couldn't imagine going through life without feeling that spectrum of emotion. There are wonderful days when I feel my cup runneth over. There are days that I want to run away and question every decision I have ever made. Feeling it all, good or bad, gives my life purpose. Motherhood is walking around with all of your nerve endings raw and exposed. It is the most extreme measure of being alive",1

"As Barack Obama's presidency winds down, Americans are feeling more than a little melancholy about the first black family leaving the White House. President Obama's soaring popularity over the last few months saw him play one of Hillary Clinton's most powerful surrogates during the election, but the one person who enjoyed even wider adoration, both on the campaign trail and off, was First Lady Michelle Obama.",1
"Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.",1
"The chance to specialise: If you have a passionate love for history, you dream of a career as a barrister or you are a budding Stephen Hawking, University is an ideal place to encounter great thinkers. If you are lucky enough to encounter lecturer and tutors who are as passionate about your field as you are, it can be intensely rewarding. Your Professors will accompany you along the most important areas of your subject provide important reading lists and keep you abreast of new developments in your chosen subject. It is no wonder that most graduates look back on their University days as the most mentally stimulating of their life.",1
"Social media can be used to educate young people. While talking to and advising kids and teens on a one-on-one basis is considered ideal, social media can do the same much more effectively and to a broader audience all at once. People like to use YouTube to express their opinions on various subjects. In the process, they attract millions of views and climb to the top of search engines. This leads to companies taking an interest in sponsorship and furnishing of better gear to make better videos while showcasing their product. Social media can be used as a voice of reason in society. Various social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are being used by the youth to create a voice for the voiceless. On Facebook, for example, groups like “Disability is not inability” are being brought up to make society more conscious of how they treat the disabled. Most of these groups are started by young people who see the essence of treating everyone equally and social media as the perfect place to spread that message.",1
"Consider instead some of the promising futures that AI could enable. AI has the potential to radically transform, in a positive way, the degree to which we can utilize and process data and information in ways that people simply cannot. In addition, simple everyday actions, such as interacting with the Internet of Things, that have become overly complex because of arcane interfaces (e.g., setting a thermostat or controlling a TV) can be radically simplified through natural language. As AI systems mature, they will drive important advancements for society, in areas like healthcare, education, the economy and many more. An AI system could help a doctor with a diagnosis, serve as a virtual teacher with the wealth of Internet knowledge at its fingertips, or be woven into the fabric of our daily lives, helping us with everything from basic decision-making to driving our cars.",1
"AI has drawn some rather extreme headlines recently, as the conversation has shifted from the progress that we are seeing to a feared end result – AI-based technology surpassing the levels of intelligence of humans and posing a threat to our existence. Apart from the popularity of such doomsday scenarios in science fiction, this outlook appears unfounded: there is currently no evidence to suggest that anything like this would necessarily happen. Perhaps even more importantly, we’re getting rather ahead of ourselves with these sorts of predictions. AI has indeed seen some encouraging and impressive progress over the last few years, but we still have a long way to go before we achieve anything capable of the scenarios that have been discussed.",-1

The role of LEDCs in the world market is mostly to provide the North and West with cheap labour and raw materials. Globalisation is viewed by many as a threat to the world's cultural diversity. It is feared it might drown out local economies, traditions and languages and simply re-cast the whole world in the mould of the capitalist North and West. An example of this is that a Hollywood film is far more likely to be successful worldwide than one made in India or China, which also have thriving film industries.",-1
"Just a generation ago if you went near a dog when he was eating and the dog growled, somebody would say, 'Don't go near the dog when he's eating!, what are you crazy?' Now the dog gets euthanized. Back then, dogs were allowed to say, NO. Dogs are not allowed to say no anymore...They can't get freaked out, they can't be afraid, they can never signal 'I'd rather not.' We don't have any kind of nuance with regard to dogs expressing that they are uncomfortable, afraid, angry, or in pain, worried, or upset. If the dog is anything other than completely sunny and goofy every second, he goes from a nice dog to an 'AGGRESSIVE' dog.",-1

"Our social media sites are shaped around what we like. It was Tim Berners-Lee who stated the internet allows users to be writers of the web. We are free to perpetrate a version of ourselves online and we freely have the ability to select what we want to represent. Our online choices reflect our personal, political and ideological values and views. According to David Gauntlett, we take attitudes, behaviour and lifestyle from media figures to steer our own personal routes through life. This communicates just how we feel we have to represent ourselves from what we are told is normal to feel accepted within society.",0
"Donald Trump has a penchant for labeling particular people. It might strike some as just another insult for a petulant urchin of a man who insults everyone with whom he takes issue.

"MOANA IS THE word for ocean in Maori, Hawaiian and Samoan, but on maps, the waters in this part of the world bear a name from another tongue, bestowed by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in 1520: Mar Pacífico, or peaceful sea.

"What kind of person would deliberately traumatize a family by calling in a false accusation? Martin Guggenheim, an NYU Law professor specializing in child welfare, could not say conclusively. But he has heard of angry exes who call CPS repeatedly, knowing that each call triggers another investigation. ""I once complained to the agency for being utterly insensitive to this problem and asked them to figure out a way to get some sense of whether a caller has made multiple reports that have proven to be unfounded, so that you not only save your own resources but save the parents from the horrible experience of being investigated countless times,"" he says.

"The film progresses via a blueprint straight out of Cinderella, with Nick's ex and company the evil step-sisters, a gay cousin and fashion stylist as fairy godmother and Nick's mother as the wicked witch sabotaging Rachel's happiness from behind the scenes.

But seeing it rolled out in a film that is being touted as a triumph for Asian film-making, is dispiriting at best.",-1
" ""The summer of 1994–1995"" makes perfect sense to residents of New Zealand but is likely to confuse anyone from the northern hemisphere. Try to use month names wherever possible. Some people argue that if an article is about a specific region then this should not be necessary. However I tested this on some people and frankly, ""summer"" has a specific meaning for most people. (For others, it means ""Christmas."") Try to say June to August, and in the worst case, say ""Northern summer"". Also Americans use the term ""fall"" to describe the season between summer and winter, most of the English-speaking world calls this season ""autumn",0
"The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as much as any development in the challenging era of Donald Trump, is testing America’s politicians and its civic institutions. Few, so far, have met the test. Not Republican senators, who, after denying one president his legitimate authority to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court, are now rushing their own nominee through, uninterested in the truth, while weeping crocodile tears about other people’s partisanship. Not Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who tainted the process by bringing forward damaging allegations against Judge Kavanaugh only at the last minute.",-1

"There are three ways to learn: by reasoning things out, by rote, and by mimicking. Because much (maybe most) learning is done via the reasoning method, intelligence is highly correlated with learning, and can even be defined as the ability to reason and learn.

Intelligent people have the ability to reason, but depending on their personality, there are many intelligent people who choose not to use their ability all the time. ",0

"In your eyes, you have rods and cones that take different light signals and turn them into electrical signals. At very low light levels, you undergo something called “dark adaptation” in which your cones (in daylight) take a nice break and your rods take over. This usually takes about 20 minutes, and it’s why dark rooms become visible at night after some time! Your cones are really good at finding tiny amounts of light—they can literally count 1-2 photons (bits of light) per sec to incredible precision. At those low light levels, however, you become really sensitive (like increasing the gain on a camera). I’m not too sure where those dots originate from—signals from rods go through a bunch of neurons to the LGN and on to different processing areas of the brain. Studying this stuff is hard, since each section can do its own thing. But my guess is that your photoreceptors trying to catch every little bit of light they can, and there’s some signals popping up that are being overamplified. Those are then turned into pretty obvious visual dots",0
"Speaking as someone who used to be homeless, people harass you just for being there. I didn’t pan Handel I was a busker, yet people still treat you as if your scum of the earth, a higher percentage of homeless people don’t want to par-take in society because society treats them poorly. I.e. society tries to condition homeless people to feel worthless making them less likely to do something beneficial. Lack of safe shelters is also a problem. You can’t get ID without an address and you can’t get a job without ID. Shelters are more often more dangerous than sleeping outside, many of them house convicts and crack heads, they’re not a nice place. Much work has to be done to tackle homelessness but this is definitely a step in the right direction.",-1
"I experienced something similar once. I just lost my bus as I was running for it. Some dude with a truck saw it go down and stopped at the bus stop and told me he saw what happened offered me a ride. I remember I was a bit on edge at the time but it was 30 mins or something until the next bus would come and I'd have to pay for that with money I couldn't really use for that at the time. Anyways, I jump in and sure enough he gives me a ride. The school was on top of a hill too and I told him he could just drop me off at the bottom due to the difficult roads for a truck to pass. He refused and drove me all the way up to the school, wished me a great day at school and drove off never to be seen again. Just gotta love people that are genuinely trying to help people that selflessly. It probably took 30-45 mins off of his route to get me to school. I still think back on it from time to time as a reminder that I can always do better for the people around me.",1
"We inherited a 1 year old pom from my fiances grandma when she couldn't care for him well enough. Never would have chosen the breed myself but he is the happiest, most expressive dog I've ever had. He isn't yappy either so that is nice. I love that little fluffy bastard.",1
"I once got a disgusting note handed to me by a guy. I read it, stared at it a few seconds, folded it up, and walked very slowly toward the teacher's desk, acting as though I was going to hand it to her. Then turned, stared at the guy and dropped it in the waste bin. His face was pale and he looked like he was terrified.",-1
